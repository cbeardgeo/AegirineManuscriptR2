abstract = {The present work is a first comprehensive study of the trace-element composition and zoning in clinopyroxene- and amphibole-group minerals from carbonatites, incorporating samples from 14 localities worldwide (Afrikanda, Aley, Aln{\"{o}}, Blue River, Eden Lake, Huayangchuan, Murun, Oka, Ozernaya Varaka, Ozernyi, Paint Lake, Pinghe, Prairie Lake, Turiy Mys). The new electron-microprobe data presented here significantly extend the known compositional range of clinopyroxenes and amphiboles from carbonatites. These data confirm that calcic and sodic clinopyroxenes from carbonatites are not separated by a compositional gap, instead forming an arcuate trend from nearly pure diopside through intermediate aegirine–augite compositions confined to a limited range of CaFeSi2O6 contents (15–45 mol{\%}) to aegirine with {\textless} 25 mol{\%} of CaMgSi2O6 and a negligible proportion of CaFeSi2O6. A large set of LA-ICPMS data shows that the clinopyroxenes of different composition are characterized by relatively low levels of Cr, Co and Ni (≤ 40 ppm) and manifold variations in the concentration of trivalent lithophile and some incompatible elements (1–150 ppm Sc, 26–6870 ppm V, 5–550 ppm Sr, 90–2360 ppm Zr, and nil to 150 ppm REE), recorded in some cases within a single crystal. The relative contribution of clinopyroxenes to the whole-rock Rb, Nb, Ta, Th and U budget is negligible. The major-element compositional range of amphiboles spans from alkali- and Al-poor members (tremolite) to Na–Al-rich Mg- or, less commonly, Fe-dominant members (magnesiohastingsite, hastingsite and pargasite), to calcic–sodic, sodic and potassic–sodic compositions intermediate between magnesio-ferrikatophorite, richterite, magnesioriebeckite, ferri-nyb{\"{o}}ite and (potassic-)magnesio-arfvedsonite. In comparison with the clinopyroxenes, the amphiboles contain similar levels of tetravalent high-field-strength elements (Ti, Zr and Hf) and compatible transition elements (Cr, Co and Ni), but are capable of incorporating much higher concentrations of Sc and incompatible elements (up to 500 ppm Sc, 43 ppm Rb, 1470 ppm Sr, 1230 ppm Ba, 80 ppm Pb, 1070 ppm REE, 140 ppm Y, and 180 ppm Nb). In some carbonatites, amphiboles contribute as much as 25{\%} of the Zr + Hf, 15{\%} of the Sr and 35{\%} of the Rb + Ba whole-rock budget. Both clinopyroxenes and amphiboles may also host a significant share ({\~{}} 10{\%}) of the bulk heavy-REE content. Our trace-element data show that the partitioning of REE between clinopyroxene (and, in some samples, amphibole) and the melt is clearly bimodal and requires a revision of the existing models assuming single-site REE partitioning. Clinopyroxenes and amphiboles from carbonatites exhibit a diversity of zoning patterns that cannot be explained exclusively on the basis of crystal chemistry and relative compatibility of different trace-element in these minerals. Paragenetic analysis indicates that in most cases, the observed zoning patterns develop in response to removal of selected trace elements by phases co-precipitating with clinopyroxene and amphibole (especially magnetite, fluorapatite, phlogopite and pyrochlore). With the exception of magnesiohastingsite–richterite sample from Afrikanda, the invariability of trace-element ratios in the majority of zoned clinopyroxene and amphibole crystals implies that fluids are not involved in the development of zoning in these minerals. The implications of the new trace-element data for mineral exploration targeting REE, Nb and other types of carbonatite-hosted rare-metal mineralization are discussed.},

abstract = {This work reviews the experimental constraints on the concentrations of volatiles that can be expected in melts found in the crust and the saturation of such melts with a separate fluid phase. After presenting evidence for volatile concentrations in magmatic source regions in the crust and upper mantle and discussing volatile concentrations in magmatic systems, experimental results on the solubility and partitioning of H2O, CO2, S, Cl, F and a few other minor volatiles at pressures up to 800 MPa are summarized. Many of the important models used to predict the solubility and partitioning of these volatiles are then introduced and two models, both easily available for use, are compared against experimental data. Finally, a model of isothermal, closed system ascent of a granitic composition magma with water, carbon dioxide and chlorine is presented to illustrate the evolution of volatiles in a crustal magmatic system and to demonstrate how this evolution may affect the formation of ore deposits and the vesiculation of ascending magmas.},

abstract = {The Miocene-Recent East African Rift in Ethiopia subaerially exposes the transitional stage of rifting within a young continental flood basalt province. As such, it is an ideal study locale for continental breakup processes and hot spot tectonism. We combine teleseismic traveltime data from 108 seismic stations deployed during two spatially and temporally overlapping broadband networks to present detailed tomographic images of upper mantle P and S wave seismic velocity structure beneath Ethiopia. Tomographic images reveal a ∼500 km wide low P and S wave velocity zone at 75 to ≥400 km depth in the upper mantle that extends from close to the eastern edge of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) westward beneath the uplifted and flood basalt-capped NW Plateau. We interpret this broad low-velocity region (LVR) as the upper mantle continuation of the African Superplume. Within the broad LVR, zones of particularly low velocity are observed with absolute delay times ($\delta$tP ∼ 4 s) that indicate the mantle beneath this region is amongst the slowest worldwide. We interpret these low velocities as evidence for partial melt beneath the MER and adjacent NW Plateau. Surprisingly, the lowest-velocity region is not beneath Afar but beneath the central part of the study area at ∼9°N, 39°E. Whether this intense low-velocity zone is the result of focused mantle upwelling and/or enhanced decompressional melting at this latitude is unclear. The MER is located toward the eastern edge of the broad low-velocity structure, not above its center. This observation, along with strong correlations between low-velocity zones and lithospheric structures, suggests that preexisting structural trends and Miocene-to-Recent rift tectonics play an important role in melt migration at the base of the lithosphere in this magmatic rift zone.},

abstract = {Caldera-forming eruptions can be explosive and lead to the eruption of phenomenal volumes of magma that can devastate the global environment. Such eruptions involve ground subsidence related to catastrophic sinking of a magma chamber roof, accompanied by buoyant flow of magma through a ring conduit around the sinking roof . Previous work points to a feedback between subsidence and eruption: eruption initiates subsidence of the chamber roof, which in turn drives the ongoing eruption. Although subsidence-driven eruption dominates caldera evolution, the coupled dynamics of subsidence and magma flow are poorly understood. Here, we use analogue models to show that, under most conditions, caldera subsidence is spatially and temporally variable, leading to complicated and vigorous magma stirring and mixing. On the basis of the experimental results and a scaling analysis, we construct a regime diagram that helps demonstrate how the coupled flow and subsidence are influenced by the fluid dynamics and geometry of the system. The vigorous stirring we infer can considerably modify the style of subsidence and can explain textural, petrological and geochemical variation in deposits that have been related to caldera-forming eruptions.},

@article{Jourdan2007,
abstract = {We report major and trace element abundances for 147 samples and Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb isotope compositions for a 36 sample subset of basaltic lava flows, sills, and dykes from the Karoo continental flood basalt (CFB) province in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and northern South Africa. Both low- and high-Ti (TiO2 {\textless} 2 wt {\%} and {\textgreater} 2 wt {\%}) rocks are included. MELTS modeling shows that these magmas evolved at low pressure (1 kbar) through fractional crystallization of gabbroic assemblages. Whereas both groups display enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) relative to heavy REE (HREE) and high field strength elements, and systematic negative Nb anomalies, they differ in terms of contrasting middle REE (MREE) to HREE fractionation, which is greater for the high-Ti basalts. This reflects different depths of melting of slightly enriched mantle sources: calculations suggest that the low-Ti basalts were generated by melting of a shallow spinel-bearing (2 {\%} spinel) lherzolite, whereas the high-Ti magmas originated from a deeper-seated garnet-bearing (2–7{\%} garnet) lherzolite. In most isotope plots, the high-Ti lavas together with the picrites define a common trend from Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) to compositions with strongly negative ɛNdi and ɛHfi akin to those of some nephelinites and lamproites. The low-Ti rocks are shifted from BSE-like to more radiogenic Sr isotope ratios, indicative of upper crustal contamination. Trace element and isotope characteristics of the Karoo magmas require a combination of enrichment processes (subduction induced?) and long-term isolation of the mantle sources. We propose two distinct scenarios to explain the origin of the Karoo province. The first calls for polybaric melting of spatially heterogeneous, partially veined, sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Calculations show that mixing between SCLM (∼BSE) and a strongly Nd–Hf unradiogenic nephelinite-like component (sediment input?) could account for the compositional variations of most of the high-Ti group lavas, whereas the mantle composition responsible for the low-Ti magmas is more likely to be similar to a vein-free, metasomatically enriched SCLM component. The second scenario involves mixing between two end-members represented by the SCLM and its deep-seated alkalic veins and a sub-lithospheric (asthenospheric- or ocean island basalt-like?) mantle plume. In this case, the data are compatible with an increasing mantle plume contribution as the plume rises and expands through the lithosphere. Regardless of which of the two scenarios is invoked, the spatial distribution of the low- and high-Ti magmas matches the relative positioning of the cratons and the Limpopo belt in such a way that strong control of the lithosphere on magma composition and distribution is a mandatory requirement of any petrogenetic model applied to the Karoo CFB.},

abstract = {We present detailed experimental results on the partitioning of rare earth elements (REE) between titanite and a range of different silicate melts. Our results show that Henry's law of trace element partitioning depends on bulk composition, the available partners for heterovalent substitution, crystal composition, and melt composition. We illustrate that the partition coefficients for Sm depend very strongly on the bulk concentration of Sm in the system. The substitution mechanism, by which rare earth elements are incorporated into the crystal structure, plays an important role for trace element partitioning and also for the onset of Henry's law. Our data show that there are clear differences between substitution mechanisms of major elements compared to elements which are present only as traces. Our experiments also clearly show that the onset of Henry's law depends on the concentrations of the sum of all trace elements which are incorporated into the crystal by the same substitution mechanism. For geochemical modelling of magmatic processes involving titanite, and indeed other accessory phases, it is of crucial importance to first evaluate whether the REE, and other trace elements, are present as traces or as major elements, only then appropriate D values may be chosen.},

abstract = {Seismological models of upper-mantle structure are providing new constraints on the physical and chemical properties that differentiate the lithosphere from the asthenosphere. A wide variety of studies are consistent with an oceanic lithosphere that corresponds to a dry, chemically depleted layer over a hydrated, fertile asthenosphere. At the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath oceans and many Phanerozoic continental regions, observed seismic velocity gradients require a contrast in mantle hydration, fertility, and/or melt content, perhaps in combination with a vertical gradient in velocity anisotropy. Beneath cratons, evidence is growing for a deeper—but globally ubiquitous—asthenosphere. Some studies conclude that the cratonic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is gradual enough to be matched by a purely thermal gradient, whereas others indicate a more rapid transition and a contrast in composition or perhaps melt content.},

abstract = {We have performed new global regression analyses to calibrate a model of equilibrium between clinopyroxene and co-existing melt. Then we have applied this model to a restricted but important range of clinopyroxene and melt compositions from Mt. Etna volcano. The degree of disequilibrium is determined through the comparison between components "predicted" for clinopyroxene via regression analyses of clinopyroxene-liquid pairs in equilibrium conditions, with those "measured" in the analyzed crystals. The model is tested using compositions not included into the calibration dataset, i.e., clinopyroxene-melt pairs obtained from equilibrium and cooling rate experiments conducted at ambient pressure on an Etnean trachybasalt. The experiments were duplicated at the NNO. +. 1.5 and QFM oxygen buffering conditions estimated for magmas at Mt. Etna. Both equilibrium and disequilibrium clinopyroxene-melt pairs from the experiments were also used as input data for one of the most recent thermometers based on the Jd-DiHd exchange reaction. Results from calculations indicate that, under rapid cooling rate conditions, clinopyroxenes do not equilibrate with the melt. Consequently, the thermometers predict higher crystallization temperatures compared to the final experimental temperature, prior to rapid quenching of the experiment. The systematic difference between expected and measured compositions and temperatures allows us to calibrate a model that describes undercooling based on disequilibrium exchange reactions.

abstract = {Bonanza-vein gold ore from the Sleeper deposit, Nevada, was deposited at a depth of less than 500 m and exhibits a characteristic texture of alternating colloform bands of fine-grained quartz and bands of opaline silica containing abundant electrum. Textural evidence indicates that the quartz bands recrystallized from a gel-like amorphous precursor, whereas the gold-rich bands were deposited originally as amorphous precipitate formed by the coagulation of colloidal silica and gold particles. Gold and silica precipitated initially as colloidal particles at deeper levels in the hydrothermal system and were mechanically transported upward by the hydraulic action of the ore-forming fluids. Coagulation of the colloidal particles may have been caused by solution cooling or boiling, and catalyzed by hydrated polycationic Al3+ aqueous species. Transport of gold as colloidal particles in epithermal systems indicates that, at least in some instances, higher gold content is possible than in true solution. A gold-enriched ore fluid appears necessary to explain the origin of the bonanza-grade ore at the Sleeper mine, and the colloidal gold transport process locally might have played a role in the genesis of the more-common disseminated epithermal precious-metal deposits.},

abstract = {Mineral/rock matrix partition coefficients have been determined for clinopyroxene (Cpx) and phlogopite from a Mesozoic alkaline lamprophyre from Newfoundland, Canada, by Laser Ablation Microprobe (LAM-ICP-MS). Values for twenty-one elements were obtained for Cpx, whereas only eleven were possible for phlogopite due to REE abundances below detection limits ( 1 ppm). Ablation pits of 40–50 $\mu$m diameter enabled investigation of zonation in phenocryst phases. In general, phenocrysts exhibit little trace element zonation except in the outermost overgrowths of Cpx. In these, a fourfold to fivefold increase in many trace element abundances correlates strongly with increasing Ti and Al contents, in agreement with recent experimental studies. Only Li shows appreciable zonation in phlogopite, being enriched in the rims. Comparison of the partition coefficients determined by in-situ laser analysis with those obtained from apparently pure mineral separates by solution ICP-MS indicates that, for several elements, considerable differences exist, e.g., DBa 0.0006 vs. 0.0255. These differences are attributable to the inclusion of trace element-rich overgrowths, and zones of trace element enrichment and micro-inclusions, in addition to the possibility of small amounts of matrix or glass (1–2{\%}) in the nominally clean clinopyroxene mineral separates. Partition coefficients for Cpx are lower than most published values for basaltic rocks, but are comparable to experimental values for basalt determined by SIMS. Comparison with experimental values from lamproite discounts a strong bulk compositional effect, so that the discrepancy with earlier values for basalt should probably be attributed to problems with mineral separates, emphasizing the need for high quality partitioning determinations with in-situ microbeam methods. The phlogopite data extend considerably the published range; the new values are also generally lower than published values, although the discrepancy here may be due to bulk compositional effects, as many published values are from more silicic systems. The lamprophyre values are within the range of sparse experimentally determined values.},

abstract = {Extended Abstract The Lofdal rare earth element (REE) deposit in northern Namibia, which is currently being explored by Namibia Rare Earths Inc., is of particular interest because of its unusually high proportion of heavy REE (more than 85{\%}) and because previous research concluded that it was carbonatite-hosted (Wall et al., 2008). This would make the deposit highly unusual because, almost invariably, carbonatite-hosted deposits contain mainly light-REE (Castor, 2008; Moore et al., 2014; and Trofanenko et al., in press). However, as we show below, the Lofdal REE mineralization is not carbonatite-hosted. Instead, it occurs in narrow veinlets in albitite that has been subjected to later carbonate alteration, and thus the host rocks and their REE mineralization are hydrothermal in origin. The Lofdal deposit, in the Damara Orogen of northern Namibia, is spatially associated with the Lofdal Intrusive suite, a group of alkaline silicate rocks and carbonatites that were emplaced at {\~{}}750 Ma during an episode of continental rifting, which preceded the orogeny (de Kock et al., 2000). The suite intrudes Paleoproterozoic schists, gneisses, and amphibolites of the Welwitschia inlier which, together with the Kamenjab and Braklaagte inliers, forms the southern edge of the Archean Congo Craton (Miller, 2008). Several plutons and numerous NW-SE trending dikes follow the regional foliation (Fig. 1). The largest of the plutons is the Main Intrusion ({\~{}}2 km in diameter), which is composed of an early nepheline syenite facies and a later but subordinate calcio-carbonatite facies. The contact between the two facies is invariably marked by a zone of fenitised nepheline syenite. The dikes form a swarm {\~{}}5 km wide that extends {\~{}}10 km along strike. They comprise phono-tephrite, phonolite and carbonatite. However, the carbonatite dikes, are largely restricted to within {\~{}}1 km of the Main Intrusion. In addition to the carbonatites, many faults follow the regional foliation and are sites where basement gneisses and schists were albitized. Subsequent intense carbonate alteration (both calcite and dolomite) replaced much of the albitite. Weathering of these rocks, which also contain pyrite, produced brown, grey, and red zones that form ridges up to two metres wide and a metre high (Fig. 2). It is these rocks that have been misinterpreted by previous researchers as ferrocarbonatite dikes, and host the REE mineralization. The Lofdal REE deposit is one of a number of zones in the area with elevated concentrations of REE, but the only one currently deemed to have economic potential. This zone, which is referred to as Area 4 by Namibia Rare Earths Ltd. (Fig. 3), has measured and indicated reserves of 1.65 million tons of ore grading 0.60 wt.{\%} total rare earth oxide with 85.4{\%} heavy REE (Dodd et al., 2014) and is second only to Browns Range, Australia, in having the highest proportion of heavy REE among 50 deposits worldwide currently at an advanced stage of exploration. The heavy REE mineralization occurs as xenotime-(Y), which is mainly concentrated in discontinuous millimetre-wide veinlets that cut albitite and also contain biotite, calcite and, in some cases, pyrite and zircon (Fig. 4). Some of this mineralization is in biotite-rich shear zones in albitite, some is disseminated in albitite, and some is in fl uorapatite veinlets, where it occurs at triple junctions of apatite crystals that have incorporated REE at their rims. As mentioned above, the albitites and their REE mineralization have been subjected to carbonate alteration. The intensity of this alteration increases upwards and, at the erosional surface, has largely obliterated the textures of the precursor rocks, creating an impression that the xenotime-(Y) occurs mainly as disseminations in calcite or dolomite. In addition to the heavy REE mineralization, there is also light REE mineralization in the form of monazite-(Ce). This mineralization is concentrated mainly in biotite-calcite±pyrite veinlets that cut amphibolites and mafi c dikes immediately outside the confi nes of the albitized Area 4 fault, although some is seen along the fault beyond the limits of the potentially economic mineralization. The latter also occurs in biotite-calcite±pyrite veinlets, but instead of the veinlets being hosted by albitite, they occur in thin carbonatite dikelets or mafi c rocks in the fault zone. The occurrence of the REE mineralization in biotite-calcite veinlets (with or without pyrite) provides clear evidence for a hydrothermal origin. The source of the mineralizing fl uids, however, is much less clear. Given the close global spatial association of REE-mineralized rocks to continental rift-related alkaline silicate and carbonatite intrusions, and the observation that such rocks are commonly enriched in REE (e.g., S{\o}rensen,},

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Antarctica, is a large (3794 m) alkaline open-conduit stratovolcano that hosts a vigorously convecting and persistently degassing lake of anorthoclase phonolite magma. The composition of the lake was investigated by analyzing glass and mineral compositions in lava bombs erupted between 1972 and 2004. Matrix glass, titanomagnetite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and fluor-apatite compositions are invariant and show that the magmatic temperature (∼ 1000°C) and oxygen fugacity ($\Delta$logFMQ = − 0.9) have been stable. Large temperature variations at the lake surface ({\~{}} 400–500°C) are not reflected in mineral compositions. Anorthoclase phenocrysts up to 10 cm in length feature a restricted compositional range (An10.3–22.9Ab62.8–68.1Or11.4–27.2) with complex textural and compositional zoning. Anorthoclase textures and compositions indicate crystallization occurs at low degrees of effective undercooling. We propose shallow water exsolution causes crystallization and shallow convection cycles the anorthoclase crystals through many episodes of growth resulting in their exceptional size. Minor variations in eruptive activity from 1972 to 2004 are decoupled from magma compositions. The variations probably relate to changes in conduit geometry within the volcano and/or variable input of CO2-rich volatiles into the upper-level magma chamber from deeper in the system.

Eleven bulk samples of phonolite lava from the summit plateau that range in age from 0 ± 4 ka to 17 ± 8 ka were analyzed for major and trace elements. Small compositional variations are controlled by anorthoclase content. The lavas are indistinguishable from modern bulk lava bomb compositions and demonstrate that Erebus volcano has been erupting lava and tephra from the summit region with the same bulk composition for ∼ 17 ka.},

abstract = {Morgan [1,2] suggested that continental flood basalts appear as the first volcanic expression of new mantle plumes. Experimental studies in viscous liquids have shown that new, or “starting”, plumes should consist of a large bulbous head followed by a narrow feeder conduit. Analysis of the plume flow [3] indicates that, if the plume ascent is driven by thermal buoyancy, the head will entrain the surrounding mantle as it rises. The head cools and enlarges, and develops a compositional zonation of source and entrained mantle. Uncontaminated, relatively hot material from the plume source continues to flow up the trailing conduit making the temperature of the plume axis greater than that of the remainder of the head. We explore the implications of this plume structure by comparing the physical and chemical characteristics of two flood basalt provinces (the Deccan and Karoo) with predictions of the dynamical model. The chronology, tectonics and geochemistry of the two provinces all fit well with the starting plume hypothesis. We attribute the sudden onset and short duration of continental flood volcanism, over an equant area 2000–2500 km across, to melting the plume head and its subsequent decline to a narrow chain of volcanic activity, ∼ 200 km wide, to melting in the plume tail. A surface uplift of 500–1000 m is predicted but this gives way to subsidence due to lateral spreading of the plume head before the onset of the main period of volcanism. A period of enhanced subsidence is then predicted to occur as magma escapes from the mantle and loads the earth's surface, followed by slow subsidence over 109 years as the plume's thermal anomaly gradually decays. The timing and duration of volcanism has not been predicted with certainty, but activity is expected to begin as a burst and to die away rapidly over a total time of order 20 Ma, in agreement with dating which indicates that the bulk of the magmas in each province were ejected within 2–3 Ma and followed by smaller volumes over a further 5–10 Ma. The model predicts that the high-temperature picritic melts associated with continental flood basalts are derived from hot, relatively uncontaminated plume-source mantle at the plume axis and that the more voluminous tholeiitic basalts are produced by melting of cooler hybrid mantle in the plume head. This explains for why the picrites of the Karoo and Deccan are strongly enriched in highly incompatible elements, consistent with melting of an OIB-type source, whereas the associated basalts are weakly enriched in incompatible elements, consistent with derivation from a mixed OIB-lower-mantle source.},

abstract = {In modern volcanology one of the most important goals is to perform hazard and risk assessment of volcanoes near urbanized areas. Previous work has been done to assess volcanic hazard in the form of event tree structures containing possible eruptive scenarios. Probability methods have been applied to these structures to estimate the long term probability for each scenario. However, most of these event tree models show restrictions in the eruptive scenarios they consider and/or on the possibility of having volcanic unrest triggered by other forces than magmatic. In this paper, we present a Bayesian event tree structure which accounts for external triggers (geothermal, seismic) as a source of volcanic unrest and looks at the hazard from different types of magma composition and different vent locations (as opposite to a central vent only). We apply the model to the particular case of Teide‐Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, two alkaline composite volcanoes that have erupted 1.8–3 km3 of mafic and felsic magmas from different vent sites during the last 35 ka, situated on a densely populated island, one of the biggest tourist destinations of Europe, and for which limited geological and no historical data exist. Hence, the importance of volcanic hazard assessment for risk‐based decision‐making in land use planning and emergency management. A previous attempt to estimate the volcanic hazard for Teide‐Pico Viejo has been done using an event tree structure based on Elicitation of Expert Judgment. The new method overcomes some limitations of the previous method, including human decision bias, epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, restrictions on the segmentation complexity of the event tree structure, and automatically updating. The main steps are the following: (1) Design an extensive tree‐shaped Bayesian network with possible eruptive scenarios following the case of Teide‐Pico Viejo volcanic complex. (2) Build a Bayesian model to estimate the long term volcanic hazard for each scenario. (3) Apply the model to Teide‐Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes. Finally, we compare the results with those from the Elicitation method applied before, as well as previous Bayesian event tree structures developed for other volcanoes.},

abstract = {We have measured amphibole-melt and phlogopite-melt partition coefficients (D) for 22 trace elements in experimentally crystallized natural basanites with the ion microprobe. The synthesized phases display an exceptional degree of homogeneity for both major and trace elements, as demonstrated by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean counting statistics uncertainty of the measurements. In pargasitic hornblende, actinides are highly incompatible (D = 0.001), LILE and HFSE are mildly incompatible (D = 0.04 – 0.2and0.1 – 0.2, respectively), and REE partition coefficients vary from 0.05 to 0.6, with a maximum near Ho. Except for the LILE (D = 0.1 – 3.7), phlogopite partition coefficients are generally lower, especially the REE (D ≈ 0.01). The partitioning results are consistent with a model in which the variation in partition coefficient with ionic radius results from the crystal lattice strain induced by the size misfit of the substituting trace element. This result predicts a decrease in Young's Modulus (E) with increasing size of the cation sites in the crystal lattice, and E derived for the largest site in both amphibole and phlogopite agree well with experimentally determined bulk mineral values. The ability to model partitioning with an elastic strain model provides an important link between trace element partitioning and the macroscopic properties of minerals. Relative to an anhydrous peridotite, partial melting of an amphibole or phlogopite bearing peridotite will result in no Th-U fractionation, slight LILE depletions, and, aside from Ti, no significant HFSE depletions. Thus, barring the addition of any slab components besides H2O, partial melting of hydrated peridotite is not a plausible explanation for any of the geochemical features commonly associated with subduction zone magmas.},

abstract = {The Taney Seamounts are a NW-SE trending linear, near mid-ocean ridge chain consisting of five volcanoes located on the Pacific plate 300 km west of San Francisco, California. Taney Seamount-A, the largest and oldest in the chain, is defined by four well-exposed calderas, which expose previously infilled lavas. The calderas can be differentiated in time by their cross-cutting relationships, creating a relative chronology. The caldera walls and intracaldera pillow mounds were sampled systematically by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to obtain stratigraphically-controlled samples, a unique aspect of this study.

The geochemistry of the seamount varies from more differentiated to more primitive with time (6.2–8.6 wt.{\%} MgO), suggesting that the sub-caldera reservoir is open and undergoes periodic collapse, replenishment, crystallization, and eruption. The youngest and least differentiated lavas entrained a crystal cargo of plagioclase (An80–90) with melt inclusion volatile saturation pressures indicating entrapment in the lower oceanic crust and upper mantle (6–12 km, with 45{\%} between 8 and 10 km below the sea floor). Melt inclusions exhibit high Al2O3, low SiO2, positive Sr and Eu anomalies and negative Zr and Nb anomalies when normalized to typical Pacific mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). In comparison, the host lavas exhibit positive Sr anomalies, but no concurrent Zr, and Nb anomalies. Based on thermodynamic modeling using alphaMELTS, we develop a melt-rock interaction model defined by melting and assimilation of plagioclase-rich cumulates by hot, primitive mantle-derived melts. Significantly, the variability of the negative Zr and Nb anomalies cannot be explained by either cumulate melting or AFC alone. We propose that the melt inclusions record the interaction between cumulate partial melts and the assimilating melt, demonstrating the importance of cumulate melting during the assimilation process. Later percolating melts underwent diffusive interaction with, and entrained, recrystallized plagioclase cumulates resulting in the positive Sr signal without the concurrent Eu, Zr, or Nb anomalies observed in the host lavas. These results demonstrate that melt-rock interaction at the lower crust or upper mantle is an important process at Taney Seamount-A, and potentially other magmatic systems associated with seamount chains and ridge axes.},

@article{Arndt2017a,
abstract = {Some scientists and journalists, and many members of the general public, have been led to believe that the world is rapidly running out of the metals on which our modern society is based. Advocates of the peak metal concept have predicted for many decades that increasing consumption will soon lead to exhaustion of mineral resources. Yet, despite ever-increasing production and consumption, supplies of minerals have continued to meet the needs of industry and society, and lifetimes of reserves remain similar to what they were 30-40 years ago. In this volume, we discuss the reasons for this apparent paradox using our broad experience and expertise on both academic and industrial sides of the minerals sector. Many misconceptions arise from flawed estimates of the size of global mineral resources which stem from a lack of understanding of the critical difference between reserves and resources. Some authors use quoted reserves – the amount of metal proven to exist and to be economic for mining at present – when predicting imminent shortages. Resources – the amount that may be accessible in the upper few kilometres of the crust – are far larger. Over the last 150 years, improved technologies, economies of scale and increased efficiency have combined to reduce costs hence allowing lower grade ore to be mined economically. The net result is that the long-term inflation-adjusted price of most metals has decreased more or less in parallel with increasing production, a second apparent paradox that frequently is not well understood. Using copper as the principal example and other metals as appropriate, we summarise the latest research on ore deposits and the activities of the minerals industry. Following a description of the numerous geological processes that form ore deposits, we outline the scientific methods used by the minerals industry to explore for new deposits. We also discuss how resources are mined and how minerals are processed, as well as recent efforts to reduce related environmental impacts. Economic and societal factors influence supply, and these are as important as the actual presence of a resource. Finally, we discuss the critical roles that geoscientists will play in assuring continued supplies of minerals. These include the development of new concepts and techniques that will assist the discovery, mining, processing, remediation, and management of mineral resources. It is essential that researchers help to educate the general public about the need for continued exploration to find new resources to meet world growth in living standards. We demonstrate that global resources of copper, and probably of most other metals, are much larger than most currently available estimates, especially if increasing efficiencies and higher prices allow lower-grade ores to be mined. These observations indicate that supplies of important mineral commodities will remain adequate for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {We report the results of experiments on two natural marine sediments with different carbonate contents (calcareous clay: CO2 = 6{\textperiodcentered}1 wt {\%}; marl: CO2 = 16{\textperiodcentered}2 wt {\%}) at subduction-zone conditions (3 GPa, 750–1200°C). Water (7–15 wt {\%}) was added to the starting materials to simulate the effects of external water addition from within the subducting slab. The onset of melting is at 760°C in water-rich experiments; melt becomes abundant by 800°C. In contrast, the onset of melting in published, water-poor experiments occurs at variable temperatures with the production of significant melt fractions being restricted to more than 900°C (phengite-out). The different solidus temperatures (Tsolidus) can be ascribed to variable fluid XH2O [H2O/(CO2 + H2O)], which, in turn, depends on bulk K2O, H2O and CO2. Partial melts in equilibrium with residual garnet, carbonate, quartz/coesite, epidote, rutile, kyanite, phengite, and clinopyroxene are granitic in composition, with substantial dissolved volatiles. Supersolidus runs always contain both silicate melt and solute-rich fluid, indicating that experimental conditions lie below the second critical endpoint in the granite–H2O–CO2 system. Carbonatite melt coexists with silicate melt and solute-rich fluid above 1100°C in the marl. The persistence of carbonate to high temperature, in equilibrium with CO2-rich hydrous melts, provides a mechanism to both supply CO2 to arc magmas and recycle carbon into the deep Earth. The trace element compositions of the experimental glasses constrain the potential contribution of calcareous sediment to arc magmas. The presence of residual epidote and carbonate confers different trace element characteristics when compared with the trace element signal of Ca-poor marine sediments (e.g. pelagic clays). Notably, epidote retains Th and light rare earth elements, such that some melts derived from calcareous sediments have elevated Ba/Th and U/Th, and low La/SmPUM, thereby resembling fluids conventionally ascribed to altered oceanic crust. Our results emphasize the importance of residual mineralogy, rather than source lithology, in controlling the trace element characteristics of slab-derived fluids.},

abstract = {The historical eruptive activity on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) consists of relatively mafic magmas that produced mildly explosive monogenetic eruptions; this is the most likely style of eruption that might occur in the near future. Here we investigate the processes and time scales that lead to such eruptions with the aim of better interpreting volcanic unrest in the island and improving eruption forecasts. We combine geochemical and petrological information with a compilation of accounts of seismicity for the historical eruptions of Siete Fuentes, Fasnia, and Arafo. These occurred between December 1704 and February 1705 along the NE rift of Tenerife from three vents at different altitudes and more than 10 km apart from each other. The erupted volume increased with time from about 1 × 106 m3 for Siete Fuentes, to 7 × 106 m3 for Fasnia, and to 28 × 106 m3 for Arafo. All the erupted magmas were basanitic; the bulk-rock compositions became more mafic with time owing to accumulation of olivine with Cr-spinel inclusions and clinopyroxene, rather than to the arrival of a truly more primitive melt. We have identified four olivine compositional populations [crystal cores at Fo = 79–80, Fo = 81–82, Fo = 83–84, and Fo = 85–87; Fo = 100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe)] that are either unzoned or normally or reversely zoned in major and minor elements. The variety of olivine core populations and zoning patterns reflects mixing and mingling between different magmas; their proportions changed with time from Siete Fuentes to Arafo. Clinopyroxene crystals also show a variety of zoning patterns and changes in Mg/Fe and Cr contents indicative of open-system magma interactions, but are more difficult to interpret because of fast disequilibrium growth conditions. Modelling of the zoning profiles of olivine shows that early mixing occurred between two relatively evolved magmas, probably at shallow depths 1 year prior to the eruption. Another mixing event between two more primitive magmas stored presumably at deeper levels occurred less than 2 months prior to the eruption. Finally, movement from depth of the pre-mixed primitive melts and interaction with the also pre-mixed, shallower and more evolved melts occurred only 2 weeks before the eruption. Although the first and last eruptions were fed by the same magma, each also records renewed magma movement from depth and mixing before eruption and thus they were probably fed by different dike systems. The shorter transport times of weeks are also seen in our compilation of the historical accounts of seismicity associated with these eruptions. The sequence of events and their timing should be useful for interpretation of monitoring data of unrest in Tenerife, and the short times between the last processes before eruption could be considered for the implementation of emergency plans during volcanic crises.},

This chapter presents an update on the utility of noble gases as tracers of mantle processes, starting with a thorough review of advances in our understanding of noble gas behavior under mantle conditions. This is followed by focusing on the systematics of all five noble gases in a variety of mantle-derived materials, including mid-ocean ridge and ocean island lavas, paying particular attention to the published record of the past decade. These results are discussed in the context of three key themes of mantle evolution: recycling of material between exospheric and internal reservoirs via subduction zones, the significance of high helium isotope signatures with respect to primitive/depleted sources within the mantle, including their locations and mixing properties, and finally the case of low helium isotope signatures and the origin and significance of high-??

abstract = {Stable (C and O) isotope data from carbonates are one of the most important methods used to infer genetic processes in carbonatites. However despite their ubiquitous use in geological studies, it is suspected that carbonates are susceptible to dissolution-reprecipitation and isotopic resetting, especially in shallow intrusions, and may not be the best records of either igneous or hydrothermal processes. Apatite, however, should be much less susceptible to these resetting problems but has not been used for O isotope analysis. In this contribution, a novel bulk-carbonatite method for the analysis of O isotopes in the apatite PO4 site demonstrates a more robust record of stable isotope values. Analyses of apatite from five carbonatites with magmatic textures establishes a preliminary Primary Igneous Apatite (PIA) field of $\delta$18O=+2.5 to +6.0‰ (VSMOW), comparable to Primary Igneous Carbonatite (PIC) compositions from carbonates. Carbonate and apatite stable isotope data are compared in 10 carbonatite samples from Songwe Hill, Malawi. Apatite is heavy rare earth element (HREE) enriched at Songwe and, therefore, oxygen isotope analyses of this mineral are ideal for understanding HREE-related mineralisation in carbonatites. Carbonate C and O isotope ratios show a general trend, from early to late in the evolution, towards higher $\delta$18O values (+7.8 to +26.7‰, VSMOW), with a slight increase in $\delta$13C (−4.6 to −0.1‰, VPDB). Oxygen isotope ratios from apatite show a contrary trend, decreasing from a PIA field towards more negative values (+2.5 to −0.7‰, VSMOW). The contrasting results are interpreted as the product of the different minerals recording fluid interaction at different temperatures and compositions. Modelling indicates the possibility of both a CO2 rich fluid and mixing between meteoric and deuteric waters. A model is proposed where brecciation leads to depressurisation and rapid apatite precipitation. Subsequently, a convection cell develops from a carbonatite, interacting with surrounding meteoric water. REE are likely to be transported in this convection cell and precipitate owing to decreasing salinity and/or temperature.},

abstract = {Concentrations of boron in whole rocks and minerals of the peralkaline, 1.16 Ga Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusion and its granitic country rocks (South Greenland) were analysed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and prompt gamma neutron activation (PGNAA) analysis. The intrusion consists of an early augite–syenite shell, a later alkali-granite sheet and still later nepheline syenites, which dominate the Complex. Boron concentrations are high (250–280 $\mu$g/g) in all rocks containing fresh sodalite, whereas boron is constantly low in the sodalite-free augite syenites (4–6 $\mu$g/g) and in the alkali granites (7–22 $\mu$g/g). Rocks with sodalite altered to analcime contain only low amounts of boron (2–7 $\mu$g/g), which records boron extraction by late-magmatic fluids. Concentration profiles of B in the analysed minerals (olivine, amphibole, clinopyroxene, aenigmatite, eudialyte, biotite, feldspar, nepheline and sodalite) record magmatic fractionation to various extents, late-magmatic to hydrothermal fluid/rock interaction, and sub-solidus diffusion. Whole-rock concentration data cannot be directly translated into the geochemical evolution of the peralkaline melts, since they are largely affected by cumulate fractionation of sodalite and amphibole and furthermore by late-stage hydrothermal alteration processes resulting in B loss. However, trace-element concentrations of mineral zones representing equilibrium fractionation from magmatic liquids can be used in combination with mineral–melt partition coefficients to unravel the enrichment processes of elements in the melt. Boron isotope values of minerals from the intrusion and the country rocks resemble the trend observed for Li isotopes in an earlier study. Amphibole and feldspar display a clear trend from light boron in the inner nepheline syenitic part of the intrusion ($\delta$11B = −20‰ and −17‰ for amphibole and feldspar, respectively) through intermediate values in the outer augite syenites ($\delta$11B = −10‰ and −6‰ for amphibole and feldspar, respectively) to heavy boron with $\delta$11B = + 2‰ for amphibole and + 4‰ for feldspar in the country rock granites close to the contact with the intrusion. The values are interpreted to reflect the entry of meteoric fluids with heavy B along the intrusive contact.},

abstract = {Super-eruptions that dwarf all historical volcanic episodes in erupted volume and environmental impact are abundant in the geological record. Such eruptions of silica-rich magmas form large calderas. The mechanisms that trigger these super-eruptions are elusive because the processes occurring in conventional volcanic systems cannot simply be scaled up to the much larger magma chambers beneath supervolcanoes. Over-pressurization of the magma reservoir, caused by magma recharge, is a common trigger for smaller eruptions, but is insufficient to generate eruptions from large supervolcano magma chambers. Magma buoyancy can potentially create sufficient overpressure, but the efficiency of this trigger mechanism has not been tested. Here we use synchrotron measurements of X-ray absorption to determine the density of silica-rich magmas at pressures and temperatures of up to 3.6 GPa and 1,950 K, respectively. We combine our results with existing measurements of silica-rich magma density at ambient pressures to show that magma buoyancy can generate an overpressure on the roof of a large supervolcano magma chamber that exceeds the critical overpressure of 10–40 MPa required to induce dyke propagation, even when the magma is undersaturated in volatiles. We conclude that magma buoyancy alone is a viable mechanism to trigger a super-eruption, although magma recharge and mush rejuvenation, volatile saturation or tectonic stress may have been important during specific eruptions.},

abstract = {Magnetite-apatite iron ores of the Kiruna type, unaffected by deformation, have structures and textures similar to those of igneous rocks. The best examples are the El Laco deposits in northern Chile which resemble lava flows, pyroclastic deposits and dikes. El Laco magnetites have d18O values between 2.3 and 4.2‰ (V-SMOW). Magnetite from ore with a magmatic texture has a mean of 3.7‰, and the mean for magnetite intergrown with pyroxene in veins is 2.4‰. Oxygen isotope data given here, fluid inclusion results and geological evidence indicate that ore formation took place in a cooling magmatic system. Major orebodies resembling lava flows and near-vent pyroclastic deposits crystallized from magma at ca. 1000°C. Fluids from cooling magma deposited magnetite and pyroxene (±apatite) at ca. 800°C in fissures and open spaces, now present as veins cutting major orebodies. There is little evidence for significant magnetite precipitation during hydrothermal conditions. A large province of magnetite-apatite iron ore in central Chile (the Cretaceous iron belt) and the Kiruna district in northern Sweden also contain primary ore of magmatic appearance. Major deposits in the Chilean iron belt and Kiruna contain magmatic-textured magnetites with the following d18O means: Algarrobo = 2.2‰, Romeral = 1.2‰, Cerro Im{\'{a}}n = 1.6‰, and Kiirunavaara = 1.5‰. We consider all oxygen isotope data for unoxidized, magmatic-textured magnetite as representative of the Fe-rich magmas. Magnetites affected by hydrothermal alteration, recrystallization and subaerial oxidation have modified isotope signatures.},

abstract = {The Laki (Skaftfir Fires) fissure eruption in southern Iceland lasted for eight months during 1783 to 1784, and produced one of the largest basaltic lava flows in historic times (14.7 + 1.0 km3). In addition, neighbor- ing GrlmsvOtn central volcano was frequently active during the period from May 1783 to May 1785. The combined activity is interpreted as having been the result of a two-year-long volcano-tectonic episode on the Grimsv6tn volcanic system. Contemporary descriptions of the explosive activity make it possible to relate the tephra stratigraphy to the progress of the eruption on a weekly basis and show that, activity on the fissures prop- agated to the NE with time, towards Grimsv6tn. The eruption at Laki began on 8 June with a brief explosive event on a short fissure, and lava rapidly began to flow into the Skaftfi river gorge. It reached the lowlands, 35 km away, four days later and continued to flow, with variable discharge, until 7 February 1784. Approximate- ly 90{\~{}} of the lava was emplaced in the first five months of activity. The 27-km-long vent complex is composed of ten en echelon fissures distributed on both sides of the much older Laki hyaloclastite mountain. The sur- face expression of each fissure is a continuous row of vents consisting of scoria cones, spatter cones, and tuff cones. Six tephra fall units are positively identified; two units are completely composed of phreatomagmatic tephra derived from two tuff cones and the others are Strombolian deposits. The volume of tephra, including ash fall that extended to mainland Europe, is 0.4 km 3 dense rock equivalent volume, or 2.6070 of the total erupted volume. Interpretation of contemporary de- scriptions of tephra falls, combined with the preserved stratigraphy, allow the identification of ten eruptive epi- sodes during the eight months of activity on the Laki fissures. These eruptive episodes are inferred to have re- sulted from the unsteady flow of magma in the feeder system. In addition, at least eight eruption episodes oc- curred at GrimsvOtn in 1783 to 1785, five in 1783, two in Present address: Department of Geology and Geophysics, School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and Technology, University of Ha- waii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 - USA 1784, and one in 1785. Each episode at Laki began with a seismic swarm of increasing intensity that led to the formation of a new fissure, the opening of which was followed by short-lived phreatomagmatic activity caused by the high water table around the eruption site. Activi- ty usually changed to violent Strombolian or sub-Plin- ian, followed by Hawaiian fire fountaining and effusive activity as the availability of groundwater dwindled. Thus, the explosive activity associated .with the opening of each fissure was largely controlled by external water- magma interactions. Maximum effusion rotes, occurring in the first two episodes, are estimated to have been 8.5 x 103 and 8.7 • 103 m 3 s -1 from fissures totaling 2.2 and 2.8 km in length, respectively, and, in general, dis- charge gradually decreased over time. The highest rates are equivalent to 5.6• 103 and 4.5 • 103 kg s -1 per me- ter length of fissure, values that could conceivably be similar to those that produced some flood basalt lava flows. Maximum fire fountain heights are estimated to have varied from 800 m to 1400 m and convecting erup- tion columns above the vents rose to a maximum alti- tude of about 15 km. The release of sulfur gases during fountaining produced an acid haze (aerosol) which spread widely and had a considerable environmental, and possibly climatic, impact on the Northern Hemisphere.},

abstract = {We present major and trace element compositions of 154 re-homogenised olivine-hosted melt inclusions found in primitive rocks (picrites and ferropicrites) from the Mesozoic Paran?????Etendeka and Karoo Continental Flood Basalt (CFB) provinces. The major element compositions of the melt inclusions, especially their Fe/Mg ratios, are variable and erratic, and attributed to the re-homogenisation process during sample preparation. In contrast, the trace element compositions of both the picrite and ferropicrite olivine-hosted melt inclusions are remarkably uniform and closely reflect those of the host whole-rocks, except in a small subset affected by hydrothermal alteration. The Paran?????Etendeka picrites and ferropicrites are petrogenetically related to the more evolved and voluminous flood basalts, and so we propose that compositional homogeneity at the melt inclusion scale implies that the CFB parental mantle melts were well mixed prior to extensive crystallisation. The incompatible trace element homogeneity of olivine-hosted melt inclusions in Paran?????Etendeka and Karoo primitive magmatic rocks has also been identified in other CFB provinces and contrasts with findings from studies of basalts from mid-ocean ridges (e.g. Iceland and FAMOUS on the Mid Atlantic Ridge), where heterogeneity of incompatible trace elements in olivine-hosted melt inclusions is more pronounced. We suggest that the low variability in incompatible trace element contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions in near-primitive CFB rocks, and also ocean island basalts associated with moderately thick lithosphere (e.g. Hawaii, Gal??pagos, Samoa), may reflect mixing along their longer transport pathways during ascent and/or a temperature contrast between the liquidus and the liquid when it arrives in the crust. These thermal paths promote mixing of mantle melts prior to their entrapment by growing olivine crystals in crustal magma chambers. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions of ferropicrites from the Paran?????Etendeka and Karoo CFB have the least variable compositions of all global melt inclusion suites, which may be a function of their unusually deep origin and low viscosity.},

abstract = {The El Laco magnetite deposit has been interpreted as lava flows and feeder dikes formed from iron oxide magma, but more recently, as a product of metasomatic replacement. Open-pit exposure created at Laco Sur during the 1990s reveals that the massive magnetite contains magnetite-veined blocks and smaller fragments of altered andesitic volcanic rock, clearly supporting the replacement origin. Open-space growth of magnetite and pyroxene along the walls of chimney structures and veins within magnetite indicates precipitation from aqueous fluid, rather than from gas alone. The native sulfur-bearing, cristobalite-alunite alteration widespread at El Laco, and broadly contemporaneous with magnetite formation, is recognized as part of a steam-heated horizon generated in the vadose zone above a paleowater table. Consequently, the magnetite replacement must have taken place beneath the paleowater table, but probably {\textless}300 m beneath the paleosurface. Thus, mag- netite deposition at or immediately beneath the paleosurface is precluded. The main outstanding question is how hot hypersaline brine, the probable ore-forming fluid at El Laco, attained such shallow crustal levels within a high volcanic edifice without undergoing the extensive groundwater dilution documented from most shallowly preserved hydrothermal systems.},

abstract = {The internal architecture of the immense volumes of eruptive products in Continental Flood Basalt Provinces (CFBPs) provides vital clues, through the constraint of a chrono-stratigraphic framework, to the origins of major intraplate melting events. This work presents close examination of the internal facies architecture and structure, duration of volcanism, epeirogenetic uplift associated with CFBPs, and the potential environmental impacts of three intensely studied CFBPs (the Parana-Etendeka, Deccan Traps and North Atlantic Igneous Province). Such a combination of key volcanological, stratigraphic and chronologic observations can reveal how a CFBP is constructed spatially and temporally to provide crucial geological constraints regarding their development. Using this approach, a typical model can be generated, on the basis of the three selected CFBPs, that describes three main phases of flood basalt volcanism. These phases are recognized in Phanerozoic CFBPs globally. At the inception of CFBP volcanism, relatively low-volume transitional-alkaline eruptions are forcibly erupted into exposed cratonic basement lithologies, sediments, and in some cases, water. Distribution of initial volcanism is strongly controlled by the arrangement of pre-existing topography, the presence of water bodies and local sedimentary systems, but is primarily controlled by existing lithospheric and crustal weaknesses and concurrent regional stress patterns. The main phase of volcanism is typically characterised by a culmination of repeated episodes of large volume tholeiitic flows that predominantly generate large tabular flows and flow fields from a number of spatially restricted eruption sites and fissures. These tabular flows build a thick lava flow stratigraphy in a relatively short period of time (c. 1-5 Ma). With the overall duration of flood volcanism lasting 5-10 Ma (the main phase accounting for less than half the overall eruptive time in each specific case). This main phase or 'acme' of volcanism accounts for much of the CFBP eruptive volume, indicating that eruption rates are extremely variable over the whole duration of the CFBP. During the waning phase of flood volcanism, the volume of eruptions rapidly decrease and more widely distributed localised centres of eruption begin to develop. These late-stage eruptions are commonly associated with increasing silica content and highly explosive eruptive products. Posteruptive modification is characterised by continued episodes of regional uplift, associated erosion, and often the persistence of a lower-volume mantle melting anomaly in the offshore parts of those CFBPs at volcanic rifted margins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The experimental dissolution of zircon into a zircon-undersaturated felsic melt of variable water content at high pressure in the temperature range 1,020° to 1,500° C provides information related to 1) the solubility of zircon, 2) the diffusion kinetics of Zr in an obsidian melt, and 3) the rate of zircon dissolution. Zirconium concentration profiles observed by electron microprobe in the obsidian glass adjacent to a large, polished zircon face provide sufficient information to calculate model diffusion coefficients. Results of dissolution experiments conducted in the virtual absence of water ({\textless}0.2{\%} H2O) yield an activation energy (E) for Zr transport in a melt ofM=1.3 [whereM is the cation ratio (Na+K+2Ca)/(Al{\textperiodcentered}Si)] of 97.7±2.8 kcal-mol−1, and a frequency factor (D 0) of 980 −580 +1,390 cm2-sec−1. Hydrothermal experiments provide an E=47.3±1.9 kcal-mol−1 andD 0=0.030 −0.015 +0.030 cm2-sec−1. Both of these results plot close to a previously defined diffusion compensation line for cations in obsidian. The diffusivity of Zr at 1,200° C increases by a factor of 100 over the first 2{\%} of water introduced into the melt, but subsequently rises by only a factor of five to an apparent plateau value of ∼2×10−9 cm2-sec−1 by ∼6{\%} total water content. The remarkable contrast between the wet and dry diffusivities, which limits the rate of zircon dissolution into granitic melt, indicates that a 50 $\mu$m diameter zircon crystal would dissolve in a 3 to 6{\%} water-bearing melt at 750° C in about 100 years, but would require in excess of 200 Ma to dissolve in an equivalent dry system. From this calculation we conclude that zircon dissolution proceeds geologically instantaneously in an undersaturated, water-bearing granite. Estimates of zircon solubility in the obsidian melt in the temperature range of 1,020° C to 1,500° C confirm and extend an existing model of zircon solubility to these higher temperatures in hydrous melts. However, this model does not well describe zircon saturation behavior in systems with less than about 2{\%} water.},

abstract = {The Perhentian complex consists of two series of plutonic rocks, the younger Perhentian granite and the older Perhentian Kecil syenite. They form a reversely zoned complex where the syenitic rock is rimmed by the granitic rock. The former ranges in composition from syenite to monzonite to gabbroic rocks whereas syenogranite dominates in the latter pluton. The syenitic rocks are characterized by an extended composition of lower SiO2 (46 to 66{\%}) compared to the Perhentian granite ({\textgreater}70.9{\%} SiO2). The granitic rocks have significantly low Al2O3, TiO2, Fetot, MnO, MgO, CaO and P2O5, Sr, Ba and V compared to the syenitic rocks. Petrology and geochemical studies indicate that both rocks were crystallines by individual melts probably derived from different sources. It suggests that the syenitic magma was formed by hydrous melting of lower crust probably as a result of underplating by, or intrusion of mantle derived basaltic magmas. The strong enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (Sr and Ba) is probably related to transfer of enriched (hydrous?) fluids from the mantle into the lower crust, and possibly initiated melting to form the syenite. In contrast to the Perhentian Kecil Syenite, the Perhentian Granite has no mafic association. The felsic nature of the Perhentian granite suggests that it may be derived from a SiO2 rich source or may represent a minimum melt, the first melt produced from a solid containing plagioclase-feldspar-quartz.},

abstract = {Post-Paleozoic magmatism in Angola and Namibia (SW Africa) is widespread along the continental margin (flood tholeiites of the Paran{\'{a}}-Etendeka system), and along transverse lineaments (alkaline and alkaline-carbonatitic complexes; sodic and potassic suites). These different magmatic suites are strictly associated in space and/ or time. Variable melting degrees of a veined lithospheric mantle are proposed for the most "primitive" magmas from geochemical modeling and Sr-Nd isotope systematics. A complex evolution emerges for some ultramafic rocks (cumulus processes) and for differentiated rock compositions (assimilation and fractional crystallization, AFC, magma mixing), which may also involve anatexis of the crystalline basement and emplacement of S-type granites and rhyolites. Melting of a lithospheric mantle, without an appreciable contribution of the asthenosphere (thermal input excepted), is consistent with regional thermal anomalies in the deep mantle, mapped by gravity of the geoid, seismic tomography, and paleomagnetic analysis. The Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande "hotspot tracks" are interpreted as stress response in the lithosphere during rifting.

@article{McCanta2004,
abstract = {Oxygen fugacity (fO2) is an important parameter because it influences the crystallization sequences of magmas, as well as the composition of the resultant minerals. Traditionally fO2 has been estimated using coexisting Fe-Ti oxide compositions or Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios in silicate melts, for which the relationship between fO2 and Fe3+ has been calibrated. Problems arise in systems where oxides and/or glasses (melts) are absent, or when oxides are suspected to have been re-equilibrated. Therefore, it is important to develop alternate ways to look at fO2 in volcanic rocks. In this work, we describe a set of experiments to establish the relationship between the Fe3+ content of clinopyroxene and a basaltic melt as a function of oxygen fugacity. The starting bulk compositions were chosen to be representative of martian parental melts, with pyroxene (either augite or pigeonite) on their liquidi, in order for the results to be applicable to the martian meteorite magma source regions. Experimental conditions ranged from fO2 = IW to {\~{}}IW+8.6 at 1165 °C for pigeonite/melt pairs and at 1235 °C for melts alone, and fO2 = IW-1 to IW+4 at {\~{}}1190 °C for augite/melt pairs. Results show that Fe3+ varies from 0–65{\%} of the total Fe over this range of experimental conditions, and mass D (wt{\%}FePyx3+/wt{\%}Femelt3+) ranged from 0.75–1.44 and from 0.00–0.77, for pigeonite and augite respectively. XANES and M{\"{o}}ssbauer analytical methods give similar results within known error bars of the two techniques, with the best agreement in compositions with {\textgreater}10{\%} Fe3+. Our data show that only at high values of fO2 ({\textgreater}IW + 3.5, or ≈QFM) can Fe3+ distribution in pyroxene be used to estimate crystallization oxygen fugacity.},

abstract = {Seismological images of the Earth's mantle reveal three distinct changes in velocity structure, at depths of 410, 660 and 2,700 km. The first two are best explained by mineral phase transformations, whereas the third-the D" layer-probably reflects a change in chemical composition and thermal structure. Tomographic images of cold slabs in the lower mantle, the displacements of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities around subduction zones, and the occurrence of small-scale heterogeneities in the lower mantle all indicate that subducted material penetrates the deep mantle, implying whole-mantle convection. In contrast, geochemical analyses of the basaltic products of mantle melting are frequently used to infer that mantle convection is layered, with the deeper mantle largely isolated from the upper mantle. We show that geochemical, seismological and heat-flow data are all consistent with whole-mantle convection provided that the observed heterogeneities are remnants of recycled oceanic and continental crust that make up about 16 and 0.3 per cent, respectively, of mantle volume.},

abstract = {A characterization of mineral apatite samples using Nuclear Microprobe techniques was made. Thin polished sections of apatite in calcite matrix were analyzed by PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission) and IL (ion luminescence) for major and trace elements quantification. Some Rare Earth Elements (REE), which are IL activators mainly in the UV and visible region, present in the sample in concentrations far below the minimum detectable limit by PIXE method, could still display characteristic luminescence spectra. Hence, IL is a very useful complementary method to traditional ion beam analytical techniques such as PIXE, and NRA (nuclear reaction analysis) for application in geology. The results are in perfect agreement with some available information about previous tectonic studies performed in the Nampula geological province and show some possibility of beginning a semi-artesian exploitation of the apatite for use in local subsistence farming as a cheap fertilizer. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Crystals formed prior to a volcanic event can provide evidence of processes leading to and timing of eruptions. Clinopyroxene is common in basaltic to intermediate volcanoes, however, its ability as a recorder of pre-eruptive histories has remained comparatively underexplored. Here we show that novel high-resolution trace element images of clinopyroxene track eruption triggers and timescales at Mount Etna (Sicily, Italy). Chromium (Cr) distribution in clinopyroxene from 1974 to 2014 eruptions reveals punctuated episodes of intrusion of primitive magma at depth. Magma mixing efficiently triggered volcanism (success rate up to 90{\%}), within only 2 weeks of arrival of mafic intrusions. Clinopyroxene zonations distinguish between injections of mafic magma and regular recharges with more evolved magma, which often fail to tip the system to erupt. High Cr zonations can therefore be used to reconstruct past eruptions and inform responses to geophysical signals of volcano unrest, potentially offering an additional approach to volcano hazard monitoring.},

abstract = {Partition coefficients for Th, U, Pb, rare-earth elements (REE), high field strength elements (HFSE), alkaline-earth elements, Sc, Cr, V and K were measured by ion microprobe techniques in two experiments on a natural high-alumina basalt composition from Medicine Lake, California. All elements were measured at natural abundance levels except Th, U and Pb, which were each present in the starting mix at 1-wt{\%} levels. The results show that garnet retains U preferentially over Th (DgtmeltU = 0.0059, DgtmeltTh = 0.0014), while clinopyroxene shows the opposite sense of partitioning (DcpxmeltU = 0.0127, DcpxmeltTh = 0.014). The experimental Th, U and Pb partition coefficients for garnet-melt and cpx-melt are consistent with garnet-cpx pairs from garnet-bearing ultramafic rocks which exhibit U-Pb isochrons, thus demonstrating equilibrium (DgtcpxU = 0.30, DgtcpxTh = 0.072, DgtcpxPb = 0.016). The partition coefficients for Th and U between clinopyroxene and basaltic melt vary systematically as a function of the tetrahedral Al content of clinopyroxene. Garnet/melt values for Th, U and Pb agree with previous determinations, indicating that mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) generation begins in the stability field of garnet lherzolite. However, high 226Ra230Th ratios in MORB require very small porosities near the region where the melts lose chemical equilibrium with the mantle. Partitioning data for HFSE and REE suggest that this region of melt segregation is not in the spinel lherzolite field. This requires either rapid transport of MORB magmas from ϵ 70 km, or some degree of disequilibrium during melt generation and/or transport.},

abstract = {Variation of Nernst partition coefficients (D) between olivine and silicate melts cannot be neglected when modeling partial melting and fractional crystallization. Published natural and experimental olivine/liquidD data were examined for covariation with pressure, temperature, olivine forsterite content, and melt SiO2, H2O, MgO and MgO/MgO + FeOtotal. Values of olivine/liquidD generally increase with decreasing temperature and melt MgO content, and with increasing melt SiO2 content, but generally show poor correlations with other variables. Multi-element olivine/liquidD profiles calculated from regressions of D REE-Sc-Y vs. melt MgO content are compared to results of the Lattice Strain Model to link melt MgO and: D0 (the strain compensated partition coefficient), EM3+ (Young's Modulus), and r0 (the size of the M site). Ln D0 varies linearly with Ln MgO in the melt; EM3+ varies linearly with melt MgO, with a dog-leg at ca. 1.5{\%} MgO; and r0 remains constant at 0.807 A7ring;. These equations are then used to calculate olivine/liquidD for these elements using the Lattice Strain Model. These empirical parameterizations of olivine/liquidD variations yield results comparable to experimental or natural partitioning data, and can easily be integrated into existing trace element modeling algorithms. The olivine/liquidD data suggest that basaltic melts in equilibrium with pure olivine may acquire small negative Ta-Hf-Zr-Ti anomalies, but that negative Nb anomalies are unlikely to develop. Misfits between results of the Lattice Strain Model and most light rare earth and large ion lithophile partitioning data suggest that kinetic effects may limit the lower value of D for extremely incompatible elements in natural situations characterized by high cooling/ crystallization rates. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {No crustal rocks are known to have survived since the time of the intense meteor bombardment that affected Earth between its formation about 4,550 Myr ago and 4,030 Myr, the age of the oldest known components in the Acasta Gneiss of northwestern Canada. But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404 8 Myr—about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (18O values from 7.4 to 5.0), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high 18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a 18O value from 8.5 to 9.5. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

abstract = {The Nechalacho rare metal deposit, and in particular its heavy rare earth element (HREE)-enriched Basal zone, constitute a world-class resource of REEs, zirconium, and niobium. The deposit formed by magmatic accumulation and interstitial crystallization of eudialyte in the upper part of a 2176 Ma layered agpaitic neph-eline syenite intrusion. Its endowment in HREEs compared to later-crystallized units in the intrusion is a result of emplacement-level fractionation combined with the compatibility of HREEs in the eudialyte deposited in the Basal zone. Despite the enrichment of REEs, Nb, and Zr by igneous processes and evidence for the immo-bility of these elements in the Basal zone, hydrothermal alteration had a major impact on the mineralogy of the deposit: eudialyte was completely replaced by a quasi-miaskitic hydrothermal assemblage consisting of REE-Nb-enriched zircon and secondary REE and Nb minerals, mainly fergusonite-(Y) and bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce). The host aegirine-nepheline syenite was metasomatically altered to a biotite + quartz + magnetite ± ankerite ± fluorite assemblage. Sodium was lost in large proportions during the alteration, and substantial amounts of Mg were introduced. Mineral equilibria calculated for the hydrothermal conditions (300°C and 4 kbar) indicate that the fluid was mildly reducing (fO 2 was 2.0–3.6 log units above the quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer) and that pH was moderately acidic to mildly alkaline (between 3.7 and 5.7). It is likely that the hydrothermal fluid was initially acidic and neutralized upon reaction with the nepheline syenites. In contrast, the pH for magmatic fluids in equilibrium with fresh nepheline syenite was alkaline, owing to the reaction of nepheline to analcime. Hence, we conclude that the acidic, Mg-bearing hydrothermal fluid responsible for the in situ replacement of eudia-lyte and alteration of the host syenites was externally derived, likely a crustal fluid introduced during a 1871 to 1835 Ma, regionally pervasive hydrothermal event. The identity and composition of the secondary REE-Nb minerals that now make up the mineral resource were controlled by the original composition of eudialyte and the fluids.},

Instead, immobile element proxies for fractionation indices, alkalinity, mantle temperature, mantle flow and subduction addition may be used to classify ophiolite lavas and fingerprint the precise setting of the ridge at which an ophiolite formed.

abstract = {The Rustenberg Layered Suite of the Bushveld Complex originated in the mantle, but is characterized by variably radiogenic strontium, neodymium, lead and osmium initial isotope ratios and more elevated $\delta$18O values than expected from a partial melt of primitive mantle. It is not clear whether Bushveld magmas assimilated material from the crust, or whether they were instead generated from an eclogitic mantle source that contained crustal material. Here we report the $\Delta$33S of fifteen whole-rock and sulfide separate samples from both the Main and Critical Zones of the Bushveld, including the UG2 Chromitite and the Merensky Reef. All samples have positive $\Delta$33S values (0.11±0.02‰, 1$\sigma$) and $\delta$34S values (2.2±0.6‰, 1$\sigma$). Non-zero $\Delta$33S is fundamentally a surface process. Since high-temperature processes are not known to produce significant change in $\Delta$33S, the positive $\Delta$33S indicates that the Bushveld sulfur contains a sedimentary or surface-derived component. The homogeneity of $\Delta$33S values for this suite of samples contrasts with the heterogeneity displayed by strontium, neodymium, lead and osmium initial isotope ratios of the Bushveld and requires that the sulfur contamination occurred prior to the emplacement of the Bushveld in the upper crust. Possible sources of contamination include lower crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Limited multiple sulfur isotopic measurements of these reservoirs exist; more work needs to be done to constrain whether they contain surface-derived sulfur with non-zero $\Delta$33S, and if they do, whether the concentrations and isotopic compositions of these reservoirs can explain the measured $\Delta$33S of the Bushveld.},

abstract = {Models of continental flood basalt (CFB) formation are evaluated by examining their implications for the setting, mainly temperature and depth, of melting which is assumed to result from adiabatic decompression. Most attractive is the model of melting in upwelling bodies (probably plume heads) rising to the base of the continental lithosphere. This constrains the melting to 120–150 km or deeper (continental lithospheric thickness) and thus the plume potential temperatures to ≥ 300 °C higher than ambient mantle. The primary melts should be hot, MgO-rich, modified during ascent, and assimilate components of the lithosphere, which can provide the continental-like geochemical signature of many CFB. Circulation within the upwellings and presence of eclogite patches also influence magma generation and composition. Dehydration melting when plumes heat the lowermost lithosphere can generate CFB only if the source region contains ca. 15{\%} hydrous minerals beneath the entire area covered by flood volcanics, which is difficult to justify. On the other hand, assimilation of “continental” chemical components from large parts of the lithosphere does not require such extreme metasomatism. Decompression melting under strongly thinned rifted lithosphere requires lower potential temperatures of the rising material and lesser modification of the primary magmas than the plume head model of CFB formation. Available observations do not support the contemporaneity of flood volcanism with rifts having the required sizes and histories, but more information is needed to further test this model. On the other hand, magma production can assist rift initiation and lithospheric rupture, so subsequent thinning can explain the common formation of volcanic rifted margins immediately following CFB emplacement. Ancient LIP should record the same processes as seen in young CFB.},

The stability of AlF-bearing titanite Ca(Ti,Al)(O,F)SiO4$\backslash$nwas investigated by thermodynamic modelling in the system Ca-Al-Si-Ti-O-F-H-C$\backslash$nand subsystems.

Thus, the increasing amount of CaAlFSiO4$\backslash$nalong the binary join is the reason why titanite with XAl{\textgreater}0.65{\&}{\#}{\#}450.15$\backslash$nbecomes unstable in most petrogenetic grids presented here. The compositional$\backslash$nlimit of natural titanite (XAl{\&}{\#}{\#}440.54) probably reflects the point$\backslash$nbeyond which the less stable end member begins to dominate the solid-solution,$\backslash$naffecting both crystal structure and thermodynamic stability.ER -$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The phase relationships of three peralkaline rhyolites from the Kenya Rift have been established at 150 and 50 MPa, at oxygen fugacities of NNO − 1{\textperiodcentered}6 and NNO + 3{\textperiodcentered}6 (log fO2 relative to the Ni–NiO solid buffer), between 800 and 660°C and for melt H2O contents ranging between saturation and nominally anhydrous. The stability fields of fayalite, sodic amphiboles, chevkinite and fluorite in natural hydrous silicic magmas are established. Additional phases include quartz, alkali feldspar, ferrohedenbergite, biotite, aegirine, titanite, montdorite and oxides. Ferrohedenbergite crystallization is restricted to the least peralkaline rock, together with fayalite; it is replaced at low melt water contents by ferrorichterite. Riebeckite–arfvedsonite appears only in the more peralkaline rocks, at temperatures below 750°C (dry) and below 670°C at H2O saturation. Under oxidizing conditions, it breaks down to aegirine. In the more peralkaline rocks, biotite is restricted to temperatures below 700°C and conditions close to H2O saturation. At 50 MPa, the tectosilicate liquidus temperatures are raised by 50–60°C, and that of amphibole by 30°C. Riebeckite–arfvedsonite stability extends down nearly to atmospheric pressure, as a result of its F-rich character. The solidi of all three rocks are depressed by 40–100°C compared with the solidus of the metaluminous granite system, as a result of the abundance of F and Cl. Low fO2 lowers solidus temperatures by at least 30°C. Comparison with studies of metaluminous and peraluminous felsic magmas shows that plagioclase crystallization is suppressed as soon as the melt becomes peralkaline, whatever its CaO or volatile contents. In contrast, at 100 MPa and H2O saturation, the liquidus temperatures of quartz and alkali feldspar are not significantly affected by changes in rock peralkalinity, showing that the incorporation of water in peralkaline melts diminishes the depression of liquidus temperatures in dry peralkaline silicic melts compared with dry metaluminous or peraluminous varieties. At 150 MPa, pre-eruptive melt H2O contents range from 4 wt {\%} in the least peralkaline rock to nearly 6 wt {\%} in the two more peralkaline compositions, in broad agreement with previous melt inclusion data. The experimental results imply magmatic fO2 at or below the fayalite–quartz–magnetite solid buffer, temperatures between 740 and 660°C, and melt evolution under near H2O saturation conditions.},

abstract = {The silico‑carbonatite dykes of the Huanglongpu area, Lesser Qinling, China, are unusual in that they are quartz-bearing, Mo-mineralised and enriched in the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) relative to typical carbonatites. The textures of REE minerals indicate crystallisation of monazite-(Ce), bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce), parisite-(Ce) and aeschynite-(Ce) as magmatic phases. Burbankite was also potentially an early crystallising phase. Monazite-(Ce) was subsequently altered to produce a second generation of apatite, which was in turn replaced and overgrown by britholite-(Ce), accompanied by the formation of allanite-(Ce). Bastn{\"{a}}site and parisite where replaced by synchysite-(Ce) and r{\"{o}}ntgenite-(Ce). Aeschynite-(Ce) was altered to uranopyrochlore and then pyrochlore with uraninite inclusions. The mineralogical evolution reflects the evolution from magmatic carbonatite, to more silica-rich conditions during early hydrothermal processes, to fully hydrothermal conditions accompanied by the formation of sulphate minerals. Each alteration stage resulted in the preferential leaching of the LREE and enrichment in the HREE. Mass balance considerations indicate hydrothermal fluids must have contributed HREE to the mineralisation. The evolution of the fluorcarbonate mineral assemblage requires an increase in aCa2+and aCO32−in the metasomatic fluid (where a is activity), and breakdown of HREE-enriched calcite may have been the HREE source. Leaching in the presence of strong, LREE-selective ligands (Cl−) may account for the depletion in late stage minerals in the LREE, but cannot account for subsequent preferential HREE addition. Fluid inclusion data indicate the presence of sulphate-rich brines during alteration, and hence sulphate complexation may have been important for preferential HREE transport. Alongside HREE-enriched magmatic sources, and enrichment during magmatic processes, late stage alteration with non-LREE-selective ligands may be critical in forming HREE-enriched carbonatites.},

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Antarctica, is a large (3794 m) alkaline open-conduit stratovolcano that hosts a vigorously convecting and persistently degassing lake of anorthoclase phonolite magma. The composition of the lake was investigated by analyzing glass and mineral compositions in lava bombs erupted between 1972 and 2004. Matrix glass, titanomagnetite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and fluor-apatite compositions are invariant and show that the magmatic temperature (∼ 1000°C) and oxygen fugacity ($\Delta$logFMQ = − 0.9) have been stable. Large temperature variations at the lake surface ({\~{}} 400–500°C) are not reflected in mineral compositions. Anorthoclase phenocrysts up to 10 cm in length feature a restricted compositional range (An10.3–22.9Ab62.8–68.1Or11.4–27.2) with complex textural and compositional zoning. Anorthoclase textures and compositions indicate crystallization occurs at low degrees of effective undercooling. We propose shallow water exsolution causes crystallization and shallow convection cycles the anorthoclase crystals through many episodes of growth resulting in their exceptional size. Minor variations in eruptive activity from 1972 to 2004 are decoupled from magma compositions. The variations probably relate to changes in conduit geometry within the volcano and/or variable input of CO2-rich volatiles into the upper-level magma chamber from deeper in the system. Eleven bulk samples of phonolite lava from the summit plateau that range in age from 0 ± 4 ka to 17 ± 8 ka were analyzed for major and trace elements. Small compositional variations are controlled by anorthoclase content. The lavas are indistinguishable from modern bulk lava bomb compositions and demonstrate that Erebus volcano has been erupting lava and tephra from the summit region with the same bulk composition for ∼ 17 ka.},

@article{Mondal2006,
abstract = {Chromitite layers are common in large mafic layered intrusions. A widely accepted hypothesis holds that the chromitites formed as a consequence of injection and mixing of a chemically relatively primitive magma into a chamber occupied by more evolved magma. This forces supersaturation of the mixture in chromite, which upon crystallization accumulates on the magma chamber floor to form a nearly monomineralic layer. To evaluate this and other genetic hypotheses to explain the chromitite layers of the Bushveld Complex, we have conducted a detailed study of the silicate-rich layers immediately above and below the UG2 chromitite and another chromitite layer lower in the stratigraphic section, at the top of the Lower Critical Zone. The UG2 chromitite is well known because it is enriched in the platinum-group elements and extends for nearly the entire 400 km strike length of the eastern and western limbs of the Bushveld Complex. Where we have studied the sequence in the central sector of the eastern Bushveld, the UG2 chromitite is embedded in a massive, 25 m thick plagioclase pyroxenite consisting of 60–70 vol. {\%} granular (cumulus) orthopyroxene with interstitial plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and accessory phases. Throughout the entire pyroxenite layer orthopyroxene exhibits no stratigraphic variations in major or minor elements (Mg-number = 79{\textperiodcentered}3–81{\textperiodcentered}1). However, the 6 m of pyroxenite below the chromitite (footwall pyroxenite) is petrographically distinct from the 17 m of hanging wall pyroxenite. Among the differences are (1) phlogopite, K-feldspar, and quartz are ubiquitous and locally abundant in the footwall pyroxenite but generally absent in the hanging wall pyroxenite, and (2) plagioclase in the footwall pyroxenite is distinctly more sodic and potassic than that in the hanging wall pyroxenite (An45–60 vs An70–75). The Lower Critical Zone chromitite is also hosted by orthopyroxenite, but in this case the rocks above and below the chromitite are texturally and compositionally identical. For the UG2, we interpret the interstitial assemblage of the footwall pyroxenite to represent either interstitial melt that formed in situ by fractional crystallization or chemically evolved melt that infiltrated from below. In either case, the melt was trapped in the footwall pyroxenite because the overlying UG2 chromitite was less permeable. If this interpretation is correct, the footwall and hanging wall pyroxenites were essentially identical when they initially formed. However, all the models of chromitite formation that call on mixing of magmas of different compositions or on other processes that result in changes in the chemical or physical conditions attendant on the magma predict that the rocks immediately above and below the chromitite layers should be different. This leads us to propose that the Bushveld chromitites formed by injection of new batches of magma with a composition similar to the resident magma but carrying a suspended load of chromite crystals. The model is supported by the common observation of phenocrysts, including those of chromite, in lavas and hypabyssal rocks, and by chromite abundances in lavas and peridotite sills associated with the Bushveld Complex indicating that geologically reasonable amounts of magma can account for even the massive, 70 cm thick UG2 chromitite. The model requires some crystallization to have occurred in a deeper chamber, for which there is ample geochemical evidence.},

abstract = {Lujavrites are rare meso- to melanocratic agpaitic nepheline syenites that are characterized by elevated contents of elements such as Li, Be, Zr, REE, Nb, Th and U. They are the most evolved members of the three large composite agpaitic complexes – Lovozero, Kola Peninsula, Russia; Pilansberg, South Africa; and Il{\'{i}}maussaq, South Greenland – and are inferred to stem from the same deep fractionating magma sources that fed the earlier members of the complexes. The composition of the melts that evolved into lujavrites is, however, not well known. The agpaitic part of the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex is divided into a roof series, a floor series of cumulates and an intermediate series of lujavrites sandwiched between the two. In the traditional view, the lujavrites formed from residual melts left between the downward crystallizing roof series and the floor cumulates. New field observations and geochemical data suggest that the floor cumulates and the main mass of lujavrites constituted a separate intrusive phase which was emplaced into the already consolidated roof series rocks largely by piecemeal stoping. Studies of the contact facies of the floor cumulates indicate that the initial magma of the floor cumulate–lujavrite sequence was peralkaline nepheline syenitic with enhanced contents of Zr, Hf, HREE, Y, Nb, Ta, F, Ba and Sr. Subsequent crystallization in a closed system resulted in the formation of the floor cumulates and lujavrites. Chemical analyses of dykes within and outside the complex represent stages in the magmatic evolution of the agpaitic rocks.},

@article{Hildreth1988,
abstract = {Fifteen andesite-dacite stratovolcanoes on the volcanic front of a single segment of the Andean arc show along-arc changes in isotopic and elemental ratios that demonstrate large crustal contributions to magma genesis. All 15 centers lie 90 km above the Benioff zone and 280±20 km from the trench axis. Rate and geometry of subduction and composition and age of subducted sediments and seafloor are nearly constant along the segment. Nonetheless, from S to N along the volcanic front (at 57.5{\%} SiO2) K2O rises from 1.1 to 2.4 wt {\%}, Ba from 300 to 600 ppm, and Ce from 25 to 50 ppm, whereas FeO*/MgO declines from {\textgreater}2.5 to 1.4. Ce/Yb and Hf/Lu triple northward, in part reflecting suppression of HREE enrichment by deep-crustal garnet. Rb, Cs, Th, and U contents all rise markedly from S to N, but Rb/Cs values double northward — opposite to prediction were the regional alkali enrichment controlled by sediment subduction. K/Rb drops steeply and scatters greatly within many (biotite-free) andesitic suites. Wide diversity in Zr/Hf, Zr/Rb, Ba/Ta, and Ba/La within and among neighboring suites (which lack zircon and alkali feldspar) largely reflects local variability of intracrustal (not slab or mantle) contributions. Pb-isotope data define a limited range that straddles the Stacey-Kramers line, is bracketed by values of local basement rocks, in part plots above the field of Nazca plate sediment, and shows no indication of a steep (mantle+sedimentary) Pb mixing trend. 87Sr/86Sr values rise northward from 0.7036 to 0.7057, and 143Nd/144Nd values drop from 0.5129 to 0.5125. A northward climb in basal elevation of volcanic-front edifices from 1350 m to 4500 m elevation coincides with a Bougueranomaly gradient from −95 to −295 mgal, interpreted to indicate thickening of the crust from 30–35 km to 50–60 km. Complementary to the thickening crust, the mantle wedge beneath the front thins northward from about 60 km to 30–40 km (as slab depth is constant). The thick northern crust contains an abundance of Paleozoic and Triassic rocks, whereas the proportion of younger arc-intrusive basement increases southward. Primitive basalts are unknown anywhere along the arc. Base-level isotopic and chemical values for each volcano are established by blending of subcrustal and deep-crustal magmas in zones of melting, assimilation, storage and homogenization (MASH) at the mantle-crust transition. Scavenging of mid-to upper-crustal silicic-alkalic melts and intracrustal AFC (prominent at the largest center) can subsequently modify ascending magmas, but the base-level geochemical signature at each center reflects the depth of its MASH zone and the age, composition, and proportional contribution of the lowermost crust.},

@article{Rainbird1994,
abstract = {Numerous volcanoes exist in Marie Byrd Land, a highland region of West Antarctica. High heat flow through the crust in this region may influence the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Volcanic activity progressed from north to south in the Executive Committee mountain range between the Miocene and Holocene epochs, but there has been no evidence for recent magmatic activity. Here we use a recently deployed seismic network to show that in 2010 and 2011, two swarms of seismic activity occurred at 25–40 km depth beneath subglacial topographic and magnetic highs, located 55 km south of the youngest subaerial volcano in the Executive Committee Range. We interpret the swarm events as deep long-period earthquakes based on their unusual frequency content. Such earthquakes occur beneath active volcanoes, are caused by deep magmatic activity and, in some cases, precede eruptions. We also use radar profiles to identify a prominent ash layer in the ice overlying the seismic swarm. Located at 1,400 m depth, the ash layer is about 8,000 years old and was probably sourced from the nearby Mount Waesche volcano. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for ongoing magmatic activity and demonstrate that volcanism continues to migrate southwards along the Executive Committee Range. Eruptions at this site are unlikely to penetrate the 1.2 to 2-km-thick overlying ice, but would generate large volumes of melt water that could significantly affect ice stream flow.},

abstract = {Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet(1). While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs(2,3). Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust(4-7). Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.},

Fluorite may, however, exert a decisive control on the alkali/alumina balance of sub-aluminous anatectic melts and it can affect the liquid line of descent of silicic magmas once extracted from source.},

abstract = {A detailed study of Oldoinyo Lengai has led to the recognition of two major cone-building stages. An early, predominantly phonolitic stage, Lengai I, forms the southern cone. The recent nephelinitic Lengai II developed following a major sector collapse event over Lengai I. Petrography of Lengai II lavas show that nephelinite is combeite- and wollastonite-bearing. All Oldoinyo Lengai lavas are peralkaline and highly evolved in terms of low Mg{\#}, Ni and Cr values. Within the unique Lengai II combeite-wollastonite-nephelinite (CWN) peralkalinity increases with time to extreme values (Na + K)/Al = 2.36. Mineralogical expression of peralkalinity is the presence of combeite and Na-rich clinopyroxene. In addition, exceptionally high Fe2O3(up to 10.28 wt.{\%}) in nepheline is an indicator for alumina deficiency. Combeite also shows high Fe3+. Phonolite and CWN of Lengai I and Lengai II show similarly enriched LILE and LREE values and generally parallel patterns in PM normalized and REE plots. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Phreatomagmatic activity results from the interaction of magma and external water during a volcanic eruption and is a frequent eruptive phenomenon worldwide. Such ‘fuel-coolant' reactions change the eruptive dynamics, thus generating particles that reflect the degree of explosivity. Different eruptive phases may thus be identified from deposits, allowing us to reconstruct conditions that prevailed in the past and use these to predict the level of explosivity in a given geological setting in the future.

A detailed study of the deposits from Monta{\~{n}}a Los Erales, a 70 m-high Quaternary cinder cone belonging to a rift-related chain of vents in the Bandas del Sur region, in Southeast Tenerife, was undertaken. Field observations on excavated sections and SEM analysis of tephra suggest that the eruption style changed progressively from an initial phreatomagmatic phase, through a transitional stage, to one that was entirely Strombolian. To investigate the causes and the nature of these changes in eruptive style, products from each major unit were analysed for their morphology using hand specimen observations, secondary electron microscopy, backscatter electron microscopy, and reflected light microscopy to examine fragment size variation, fragment morphologies, vesicularity, and the level of secondary hydrous alteration (e.g. palagonitisation and zeolitisation). Study results demonstrate that the initial phase of activity was largely driven by magma–water interaction, where magma may have interacted with a lens of fresh ground- or surface water. With proceeding eruptive activity the water became exhausted, giving rise to an entirely Strombolian eruptive style.

Examples of phreatomagmatic activity that occur on typical rift-related basaltic vent alignments are not infrequent in the Canary Islands. These vent systems usually erupt in Strombolian fashion, producing scoria and lava flows that do not generally extend far beyond the vent area. However, aligned feeders may intersect different strata, structural features, and different hydrological situations, thus giving rise to activity that is less predictable in setting, intensity, and duration. The occurrence of phreatomagmatism in an otherwise low-explosivity basaltic eruptive environment increases the need for awareness of the geo-hydrological situation in volcanically active areas. Studying the past eruptive history is therefore essential to derive realistic scenarios for future vulnerability evaluation and risk assessment, especially in densely populated areas like the Canary Islands.},

abstract = {Melts of the same composition as has been defined for porphyritic olivine chondrules have been crystallized under controlled cooling conditions, dynamic crystallization. The full range of textures observed in such chondrules has been duplicated in the experimentally produced analogs. The primary controlling factor in producing this range of textuures is the heterogeneous nucleation behavior. In general, if nuclei are present when cooling begins, growth starts immediately at low degrees of supercooling and porphyritic textures result. The shapes of the phenocyrsts depend on the growth rate, which in turn depends on the cooling rate. With high nucleation densities and modest to low cooling rates, the textures are microporphyritic with generally equant, euhedral phenocrysts. As the nucleatio density decreases, the phenocrysts become larger, and as the cooling rate increases, they become increasingly skeletal. If nuclei are not present when cooling begins, growth is delayed until subcritical-sized embryos graduate to supercritical nuclei. Growth usually begins at some significant degree of supercooling depending on the cooling rate and how long it takes the embryos to become nuclei. The shapes of the crystals depend on the degree of supercooling when growth is initiated and on the subsequent cooling rate. The resulting textures vary from plate dendrites (barred olivine chondrules) to randomly oriented, elongated, skeletal crystals as the degree of supercooling and cooling rates decreases. The results of a matrix of experiments set limits on the maximum melting temperatures of chondrule forming materials and the subsequent cooling rates. Based primarily on crystal shape, the porphyritic textures develop best for this composition at melting temperatures less than 1590??C and cooling rates near 100??C/hr and definitely less than 1000??C/hr. At cooling rates significantly less than 100??C/hr, the phenocrysts are generally larger than observed in chondrules, and as cooling rates approach 1000??C/hr, they become more skeletal. Barred olivine chondrule textures form best from materials melted at higher temperatures and cooling rates in the range 1000 to 3000??C/hr. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {The Upper Basin Member rhyolites are the oldest known post-collapse rhyolites of the third Yellowstone caldera. They were erupted near the caldera's resurgent domes between 516 ± 7 and 473 ± 9 ka and at 257 ± 13 ka. An unusual characteristic is their low $\delta$18O signature. Few data are available on their mineralogy and glass geochemistry, and this study fills an important gap in understanding their petrogenesis. We report new mineralogical observations and plagioclase, whole-rock and glass compositional data. Based on our observations, we describe a new lava flow for which we propose the name East Biscuit Basin flow. This unit is a quartz- and sanidine-free low-silica rhyolite (71–72{\%} SiO2 in the whole-rock) in which the dominant mineral, plagioclase, comprises two populations: (1) small fresh euhedral crystals of An20–48 (average of An31) composition, commonly part of aggregates with pyroxenes and Fe–Ti oxides; (2) large sieve-textured isolated crystals, which are slightly more sodic in composition (An19–34, average of An27). Plagioclase compositions in most other Upper Basin Member rhyolites are similar. The range of compositions for trace elements such as Rb, Th, Y and the rare earth elements is small (e.g. 158–189 ppm Rb, 20–25 ppm Th, 52–63 ppm Y, 60–82 ppm La in the whole-rock), and there is no systematic variation of these elements as a function of SiO2 content or mineralogy. Certain trace element signatures and ratios are specific to each of these rhyolites, allowing us to propose that the Upper Basin Member rhyolites originate from six independent magma batches. The coexistence of the two types of plagioclase and their progressive disappearance in the more evolved rhyolites suggest the following petrogenetic model for each magma batch. A low-$\delta$18O rhyolitic protolith is heated by replenishing magmas, which initiate melting, forming a crystal mush. Replenishment by buoyant silicic magma may enhance melting and cause mixing with the mush material. As a consequence, crystal-poor eruptible magma batches are formed, which contain small, more calcic plagioclase crystals (aggregates) formed during cooling and mixing of the replenishing silicic melt, and larger, lower temperature crystals exhibiting dissolution features inherited from the protolith.},

abstract = {The Thor Lake rare-metal (Y-REE-Nb-Ta-Zr-Be) deposit, located about 100 kilometers southeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, is regarded as one of the largest high field strength elements (HFSE, including Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, Y, and the lanthanides) deposits and hosted by alkaline granite and syenite. The T Zone deposit, one of the main mineralized zones at Thor Lake, is characterized by HFSE mineralization that has intimate connection to hydrothermal activities. The T Zone at Thor Lake provides an excellent opportunity to assess the mobility and precipitation of HFSE in magmatichydrothermal systems. The T Zone has been identified as a pegmatite that experienced multiple alteration stages. Most HFSE minerals were hydrothermally formed, as indicated by their occurrence in pseudomorphs. The most important precursor minerals for those HFSE-rich and Be-rich pseudomorphs are aegirine and mica-group minerals. The HFSE concentrations in aegirine and mica are not sufficiently high. Therefore, a dissolution-reprecipitation model cannot explain the presence of zircon and other HFSE minerals that pseudomorph aegirine. Rather, the addition of HFSE by hydrothermal fluids is required. Mass transfer calculations show that HFSE were added or removed during different alteration events. Related to the identified alteration events, the remobilization patterns of HFSE reveal that transport and precipitation of HFSE in the T Zone was likely caused by fluids with different characteristics. Magmatic and various types of hydrothermal zircon are characterized by different trace element chemistry. Titanium-in-zircon geothermometer was employed to constrain the mineralizing temperatures of the T Zone. The crystallization temperatures for the magmatic zircon from the host granite range from 792 to 1195 °C. Extremely high Ti concentrations in hydrothermal zircon from the T Zone prevent the application of Ti-inzircon geothermometry. Primary fluid inclusion assemblages (FIAs) related to precipitation of various HFSE minerals in the T Zone were identified. Microthermometric analysis has revealed that v there were likely two populations of fluids in the T Zone. According to fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS analysis and EDS decrepitate analysis, the fluids responsible for HFSE transport in the T Zone contain significant HFSE, are aqueous and dominated by Na and Cl with trace amounts of CO2 and CH4.},

abstract = {Experimental studies bearing on the genesis of alkaline magmas are reviewed, with emphasis on alkaline mafic-ultramafic magmas and the nature of their mantle sources. In contrast with previous experiments on simplified systems mainly at low pressures, more recent experiments under mantle pressures have resolved some of the problems of the earlier work. Inadequacies of petrogenetic schemes based on the model pyrolite mantle source for the generation of alkaline magma are also partly resolved by recent studies which suggest that with increasing alkalinity the possibility of deriving mafic-ultramafic magmas from a dry lherzolitic mantle source, or one with H2O as the only volatile, becomes increasingly difficult. The addition of CO2 and H2O to the source regions allows generation of magmas such as olivine melilitites, but few magmas of the olivine leucitite kindred can be generated from lherzolitic sources. Such magmas appear to be partial melts of clinopyroxenite or orthopyroxenite sources containing both volatiles. Preliminary experimental modelling of mantle metasomatism suggest that this process may readily occur. Experiments on felsic alkaline rocks with emphasis on liquid immiscibility and halogens and experiments aimed at solving specific problems are briefly considered.},

This small (300 m across) granite body once contained the world's largest body of cryolite, now mined out. The granite surrounding the cryolite body has been extensively metasomatised by F- and CO2-rich fluids, leading to zonal enrichment in HFSE and REE. Variations in the Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd systematics of the granite can be correlated with the degree of metasomatism. Unaltered granites have highly variable initial 87Sr/86Sr, and initial $\epsilon$(Nd) ratios of around -3, suggesting formation through crustal contamination of a mantle-derived magma. Metasomatised granites show higher initial $\epsilon$(Nd) ratios, which can be interpreted to suggest that the metasomatic fluid was derived from a mantle source. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Investigations of a variety of continental rifts and margins worldwide have revealed that a considerable volume of melt can intrude into the crust during continental breakup, modifying its composition and thermal structure. However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning. Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin.},

abstract = {Nd and Sr isotopic compositions as well as trace element concentrations have been determined on a suite of alkali basalts from the Massif Central, in France. Samples show a typical enrichment in incompatible elements. In particular, the REE patterns exhibit a strong fractionation characterized by a (LaYb)N ratio of about 20. The YbN content is about 10 times chondrite. The 143Nd144Nd ratios exhibit a range from 0.512775 to 0.512989, values quite comparable to those from oceanic island basalts. The 87Sr86Sr ratios vary between 0.70338 and 0.70458 and are anti-correlated with the Nd isotopic ratio.

The isotopic and the trace element (in particular REE) data have been used in order to quantitatively model the genesis of the alkali basalts. Among the several types of models tested here, the most likely one appears to be the model of mantle metasomatism. A semi-quantitative approach shows that the source of alkali basalts from the Massif Central was metasomatized prior to melting. In such a model, the basalts could be produced by rather high degrees of partial melting (such as 10 or 15{\%}) of the metasomatically enriched mantle.},

abstract = {Plate tectonics is the unifying paradigm of geodynamics yet the mechanisms and causes of its initiation remain controversial. Some models suggest that plate tectonics initiates when the strength of lithosphere is lower than 20-200MPa, below the frictional strength of lithospheric rocks ({\textgreater}700MPa). At present-day, major plate boundaries such as the subduction interface, transform faults, and extensional faults at mid-oceanic ridge core complexes indicate a transition from brittle behaviour to stable sliding at depths between 10 and 40km, in association with water-rock interactions forming phyllosilicates. We explored the rheological behaviour of lizardite, an archetypal phyllosilicate of the serpentine group formed in oceanic and subduction contexts, and its potential influence on weakening of the lithospheric faults and shear zones. High-pressure deformation experiments were carried out on polycrystalline lizardite-the low temperature serpentine variety-using a D-DIA apparatus at a variety of pressure and temperature conditions from 1 to 8GPa and 150 to 400°C and for strain rates between 10 -4 and 10 -6s -1. Recovered samples show plastic deformation features and no evidence of brittle failure. Lizardite has a large rheological anisotropy, comparable to that observed in the micas. Mechanical results and first-principles calculations confirmed easy gliding on lizardite basal plane and show that the flow stress of phyllosilicate is in the range of the critical value of 20-200MPa down to depths of about 200km. Thus, foliated serpentine or chlorite-bearing rocks are sufficiently weak to account for plate tectonics initiation, aseismic sliding on the subduction interface below the seismogenic zone, and weakening of the oceanic lithosphere along hydrothermally altered fault zones. Serpentinisation easing the deformation of the early crust and shallow mantle reinforces the idea of a close link between the occurrence of plate tectonics and water at the surface of the Earth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This problem is discussed in general drawing upon relationships at two magmatic centers: Marangudzi in Zimbabwe and Mt. Brome in Quebec, Canada. At each locality, cogenetic quartz and nepheline syenites appear to be derived from common critically undersaturated magmas. Strontium and neodymium isotope results indicate that quartz syenites bear the signatures of substantial amounts of crustal assimilation whereas nepheline syenites lack or display lesser effects. In the model outlined, quartz syenite melts develop from felsic silica undersaturated magmas by assimilation of granitic crust coupled with fractional crystallization whereas nepheline syenites form without large amounts of contamination. This model is compatible with the constraints imposed by phase equilibria.},

abstract = {Basaltic volcanoes transfer volatiles from the mantle to the surface of the Earth. The quantification of deep volatile fluxes relies heavily on estimates of the volatile content of primitive magmas, the best archive of which is provided by melt inclusions. Available data from volcanoes producing mafic alkaline lavas in a range of tectonic settings suggest high volatile fluxes, but information remains sparse, particularly for intraplate ocean islands. Here we present measurements of volatile and trace element concentrations, as well as sulphur speciation, in olivine-hosted melt inclusions and matrix glasses from quenched basanite lava balloon samples from the 2011–2012 submarine eruption at El Hierro, Canary Islands. The results reveal remarkably high concentrations of dissolved volatiles and incompatible trace elements in this magma, with ∼80 ppm Nb and up to 3420 ppm CO2, 3.0 wt.{\%} H2O and 5080 ppm S. Reconstructed primitive CO2contents, considering CO2/Nb systematics and possible CO2sequestration in shrinkage bubbles, reach weight percent levels, indicating that carbon is a major constituent of Canary Island magmas at depth and that exsolution of a CO2-rich fluid begins in the mantle at pressures in excess of 1 GPa. Correlations between sulphur concentration, sulphur speciation and water content suggest strong reduction of an initially oxidised mantle magma, likely controlled by coupled H2O and S degassing. This late-stage redox change may have triggered sulphide saturation, recorded by globular sulphide inclusions in clinopyroxene and ulv{\"{o}}spinel. The El Hierro basanite thus had a particularly high volatile-carrying capacity and released a minimum of 1.3–2.1 Tg CO2and 1.8–2.9 Tg S to the environment, causing substantial stress on the local submarine ecosystem. These results highlight the important contribution of alkaline ocean island volcanoes, such as the Canary Islands, to volatile fluxes from the mantle.},

abstract = {Carbonatite and alkaline intrusive complexes, as well as their weathering products, are the primary sources of rare earth elements. A wide variety of other commodities have been exploited from carbonatites and alkaline igneous rocks includ- ing niobium, phosphate, titanium, vermiculite, barite, fluo- rite, copper, calcite, and zirconium. Other elements enriched in these deposits include manganese, strontium, tantalum, thorium, vanadium, and uranium. Carbonatite and peralkaline intrusion-related rare earth element deposits are presented together in this report because of the spatial, and potentially genetic, association between carbonatite and alkaline rocks. Although these rock types occur together at many locations, carbonatite and peralkaline intrusion-related rare earth element deposits are not generally found together. Carbonatite hosted rare earth element deposits are found throughout the world, but currently only five are being mined for rare earth elements: Bayan Obo, Daluxiang, Maoniuping, and Weishan deposits in China and the Mountain Pass deposit in California, United States. These deposits are enriched in light rare earth elements, including lanthanum, cerium, praseodynium, and neodynium. The principal rare earth element-minerals associated with carbonatites are fluocarbon- ates (bastn{\"{a}}site, parisite, and synchysite), hydrated carbonates (ancylite), and phosphates (monazite) with bastn{\"{a}}site being the primary ore mineral. Calcite and dolomite are the pri- mary gangue minerals. At present, the only rare earth element production from a peralkaline intrusion-related deposit is as a byproduct commodity at the Lovozero deposit in Rus- sia. Important rare earth element minerals found in various deposits include apatite, eudialyte, loparite, gittinsite, xeno- time, gadolinite, monazite, bastn{\"{a}}site, kainosite, mosandrite, britholite, allanite, fergusonite, and zircon, and these minerals tend to be enriched in heavy rare earth elements. Carbonatite and alkaline intrusive complexes are derived from partial melts of mantle material, and neodymium isotopic data are consistent with the rare earth elements being derived from the parental magma. Deposits and these associated rock types tend to occur within stable continental tectonic units, in areas defined as shields, cratons, and crystalline blocks; they are generally associated with intracontinental rift and fault systems. Protracted fractional crystallization of the magma leads to enrichment in rare earth elements and other incompat- ible elements. Rare earth element mineralization associated with carbonatites can occur as either primary mineral phases or as mineralization associated with late stage orthomagmatic fluids. Rare earth element mineralization associated with alkaline intrusive complexes may occur as primary phases in magmatic layered complexes or as late-stage dikes and veins. The greatest environmental challenges associated with carbonatite and peralkaline intrusion-related rare earth element deposits center on the associated uranium and thorium. Con- siderable uncertainty exists around the toxicity of rare earth elements and warrants further investigation. The acid-generat- ing potential of carbonatites and peralkaline intrusion-related deposits is low due to the dominance of carbonate minerals in carbonatite deposits, the presence of feldspars and minor calcite within the alkaline intrusion deposits, and only minor quantities of potentially acid-generating sulfides. Therefore, acid-drainage issues are not likely to be a major concern associated with these deposits. Uranium has the potential to be recovered as a byproduct, which would mitigate some of its environmental effects. However, thorium will likely remain a waste-stream product that will require management since progress is not being made towards the development of thorium-based nuclear reactors in the United States or other large scale commercial uses. Because some deposits are rich in fluorine and beryllium, these elements may be of environmen- tal concern in certain locations.},

At this depth, fractionation ofhydrous basalt, or anatexis of gabbro and tonalite or their metamorphosed equivalents, appears to produce liquids diverging from the calc-alkaline trend.

abstract = {The trace element composition of olivine is a rapidly growing research area that has several applications of great potential. Mantle olivines can be distinguished from volcanic olivines by lower concentrations of Ca ({\textless}700. ppm), Ti ({\textless}70. ppm), and often Cr. The melting of pyroxenites derived from recycled ocean crust can be recognized in volcanic olivines by correlations of Mn, Al, Sc and Co in addition to Ni. High Ni is characteristic of olivine derived from olivine-free source rocks, but alone it does not distinguish between recycling of ocean crust, continental crust, mantle wedge hybridization, and intra-mantle melt migration. Trace elements help to identify different types of non-peridotitic ultramafic rocks, including those not formed by ocean crust recycling. High Li may be caused by recycling of continental crust, as in Mediterranean post-collisional volcanics or by interaction with carbonatitic melts, and correlation with further elements such as Zn, Na, Ti and Ca will help to identify minerals in the source assemblages, such as phlogopite, spinel, garnet, amphiboles and carbonates, and thus the source of the olivine-free assemblages. Olivines often store the earliest chemical signals of melt loss in peridotites, but later absorb trace elements from passing melts, and are thus excellent monitors of the chemistry of metasomatic agents. Trace elements distinguish between Ti-enrichment by silicate melt metasomatism (high Ti, low Ca) and high-Ca signatures associated with plumes and rift regions that may be due to carbonate-silicate melts. Li may be enriched in olivine in the orogenic mantle, indicating the involvement of melted continental crustal material. Experimental data on element partitioning and diffusion currently partly conflicts with information from natural rocks. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recently, a new model for mantle convection was proposed that may be more realistic than previous standard models. Exciting questions remain, of course, but we believe it can be used to reconcile otherwise conflicting evidence from different research fields and thus provide a new framework for further studies of convection.Drawing on some of our own recent work [Albar{\`{e}}de, 1998] and that of others we further explore the model proposed by Kellogg et al. [1999] and Van der Hilst and Karason [1999]. The new view considers that a deep layer, chemically distinct from the overlying layers, occupies roughly the lower third of the mantle. Such a deep layer would host a substantial fraction of the terrestrial heat producing elements and help close the budget of some critical isotopic systems.The subtle trade-off between chemical and thermal density variations produces significant dynamic topography, which complicates its seismic detection but facilitates downwelling slabs to pierce through it. Thermal plumes would form at the transition between the boundary layer and the overlying part of the convective mantle. Severing the tie between the depleted and less depleted and outgassed reservoirs and the seismologically identified upper and lower mantle, separated by the 660-km discontinuity, seems to go a long way toward reconciling the otherwise conflicting pieces of evidence.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, significant advances in using geophysical techniques to image the structure of magma plumbing systems have enabled the identification of zones of melt accumulation, crystal mush development, and magma migration. Combining advanced geophysical observations with petrological and geochemical data has arguably revolutionised our understanding of, and afforded exciting new insights into, the development of entire magma plumbing systems. However, divisions between the scales and physical settings over which these geophysical, petro-logical, and geochemical methods are applied still remain. To characterise some of these differences and promote the benefits of further integration between these methodologies, we provide a review of geophysical techniques and discuss how they can be utilised to provide a structural context for and place physical limits on the chemical evolution of magma plumbing systems. For example , we examine how Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), coupled with Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, and seismicity may be used to track magma migration in near real-time. We also discuss how seismic imaging, gravim-etry and electromagnetic data can identify contemporary melt zones, magma reservoirs and/or crystal mushes. These techniques complement seismic reflection data and rock magnetic analyses that delimit the structure and emplacement of ancient magma plumbing systems. For each of these techniques, with the addition of full-waveform inversion (FWI), the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the integration of geophysics with numerical modelling, we discuss potential future directions. We show that approaching problems concerning magma plumbing systems from an integrated petrological, geochemical, and geophysical perspective will undoubtedly yield V C The Author(s)},

abstract = {The Mid-Proterozoic peralkaline Strange Lake pluton (Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador, Canada) exhibits extreme enrichment in high field strength elements (HFSE), including the rare earth elements (REE), particularly in pegmatites. On the basis of a study of melt inclusions, we proposed recently that fluoride-silicate melt immiscibility played an important and perhaps dominant role in concentrating the REE within the pluton. Here we present further evidence for silicate-fluoride immiscibility at Strange Lake from a sample of the hypersolvus granite, which contains an inclusion composed largely of REE and HFSE minerals. The inclusion ({\~{}}5. cm in diameter) comprises a narrow rim containing chevkinite-(Ce) and zircon in a fluorite matrix, a core of fluorbritholite-(Ce) and bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) and a transition zone between the rim and the core consisting of a fine-grained intergrowth of bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce), gagarinite-(Y) and fluorite. We propose that the inclusion formed as a result of silicate-fluoride immiscibility, which occurred early in the emplacement history of the Strange Lake pluton, and that it represents the fluoride melt. After separation of the two melts, the boundary between them acted as a locus of crystallisation, where crystals formed repeatedly due to heterogeneous (surface catalysed) nucleation. Zircon crystallised shortly after melt phase separation, and was followed by the growth of perthite together with arfvedsonite and quartz. As a result, the silicate melt surrounding the fluoride inclusion became enriched in volatiles that facilitated crystallisation of progressively larger crystals in the inclusion; large crystals of arfvedsonite and perthite were succeeded by even larger crystals of quartz. Massive crystallisation of chevkinite-(Ce) followed, forming the rim of the inclusion. The fluoride melt, which constituted the matrix to the silicate minerals and chevkinite-(Ce), crystallised after chevkinite-(Ce), forming fluorbritholite-(Ce) and fluorite. Aqueous fluid exsolved from the silicate melt and altered the inclusion, replacing fluorbritholite-(Ce) with fluocerite-(Ce) and then bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce). This was followed by the formation of a fine-grained intergrowth of bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce), gagarinite-(Y) and fluorite at the expense of the earlier bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce). Chevkinite-(Ce) was not affected. Zircon, however, was replaced by anhydrous zirconosilicates and, in turn, by hydrous zirconosilicates. The inclusion represents the first macroscopic example of silicate-fluoride immiscibility in nature. We propose that globules of the fluoride melt were initially dispersed within the silicate melt and preserved only rarely in unaltered hypersolvus granite. They accumulated in the residual melt (and therefore in pegmatites) scavenging REE, Ca and F from the silicate melt and, with rare exceptions, were later destroyed by fluids. The latter process contributed significantly to the enrichment of the host rocks in REE, Ca and F.},

Zircon has long been recognized as the best geochronometer using the radioactive decay of uranium to lead. Recent developments in analytical techniques, using small-diameter laser, ion and electron beams, high-precision mass spectrometry and a variety of microscopic imaging methods, allow us to obtain the ages of tiny volumes of complex crystals that record stages in their long growth history. Coupled measurements of the isotopes of oxygen and hafnium provide a mineralogical window into the separation of the Earth's crust from the mantle and the temperature and character of processes involved in crustal evolution.

abstract = {The effect of fluorine on the solubilities of Mn-columbite (MnNb2O6), Mn-tantalite (MnTa2O6), zircon (ZrSiO4) and hafnon (HfSiO4) were determined in highly fluxed, water-saturated haplogranitic melts at 800 to 1000°C and 2kbar. The melt composition corresponds to the intersection of the granite minimum with the albite-orthoclase tieline (Ab72Or28) in the quartz-albite-orthoclase system (Q-Ab-Or), which is representative of a highly fluxed melt, from which high field strength element minerals may crystallize. The melt contains 1.7wt.{\%} P2O5, 1.05wt.{\%} Li2O and 1.83wt.{\%} B2O3. The main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of F on columbite, tantalite, zircon and hafnon solubility for a melt with this composition. Up to 6wt.{\%} fluorine was added as AgF in order to keep the aluminum saturation index (ASI, molar Al/[Na+K]) of the melt constant. In an additional experiment F was added as AlF3 to make a glass peraluminous. The nominal ASI of the melts are close to 1 for the minimum composition and approximately 1.32 in peraluminous glasses, but if Li is considered as an alkali, the molar ratio Al/[Na+K+Li] of the melts are alkaline (0.87) and subaluminous (1.09), respectively. The molar solubility products [MnO]*[Nb2O5] and [MnO]*[Ta2O5] are nearly independent of the F content of the melt, at approximately 18.19±1.2 and 43.65±2.5×10-4 (mol2/kg2), respectively for the minimum composition. By contrast, there is a positive dependence of zircon and hafnon solubilities on the fluorine content in the minimum composition, which increases from 2.03±0.03×10-4 (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 4.04±0.2×10-4 (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts with 0wt.{\%}F to 3.81±0.3×10-4 (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 6.18±0.04×10-4 (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts with 8wt.{\%}F. Comparison of the data from this work and previous studies indicates that ASI of the melt seems to have a stronger effect than the contents of fluxing elements in the melt and the overall conclusion is that fluorine is less important (relative to melt compositions) than previously thought for the control on the behavior of high field strength elements in highly evolved granitic melts. Moreover, this study confirms that although Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf are all high field strength elements, Nb-Ta and Zr-Hf are complexed differently in the melt.},

abstract = {The Marginal Border Series of the Skaergaard intrusion (East Greenland) crystallized in situ on the vertical walls of the magma chamber. It is subdivided into an outer Unbanded Division and an inner Banded Division. The Banded Division contains abundant centimetre- to decimetre-thick bands dominated by fine-grained mafic minerals, with a morphology evolving from almost planar to deeply scalloped and fingered with increasing distance from the intrusion margin. The morphology of these bands is reminiscent of the reaction fronts described in sedimentary basins infiltrated by reactive fluids. We propose that the banding in the Skaergaard Marginal Border Series is produced by chemical disequilibrium resulting from the suction of primitive liquid from the main magma body into the crystal mush, driven by shrinkage of the mush during solidification. Liquid porous flow results in partial dissolution of evolved pre-existing mafic minerals in the mush. This changes the mush liquid composition to one capable of crystallizing mafic rocks with a very minor plagioclase component. Abrupt solidification of this liquid, resulting in the formation of the colloform bands, is explained by supersaturation of some mafic mineral components (e.g. olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe–Ti oxides) in the infiltrating melt. We suggest that the morphological evolution of the colloform bands is a consequence of increasing crystal mush thickness with progressive differentiation.},

abstract = {The concentrations of 32 elements (major, minor, REE, Ba, Hf, Sc, V, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ge, Th and U) were measured using an ion microprobe in olivine and orthopyroxene, and in coexisting glass in the run products produced in isothermal and dynamic crystallization experiments on chemical compositions that produce porphyritic olivine, radial pyroxene and barred olivine textures. Cooling rates in the dynamic crystallization experiments ranged from 1°C/h to 2191°C/h. The mineral/melt partition coefficients (D) calculated from the measured concentrations for both olivine and orthopyroxene showed very little change between equilibrium experiments and dynamic experiments with cooling rates of up to 100°C/h. The data appear to define reliable equilibrium D values. Olivine D's range from 2 × 10-5for U to ∼ 10 for Ni, and orthopyroxene D's range from 2 × 10-5for U to ∼ 8 for Mg. There are regular relationships between the ionic radius, the valence of the trace element and the partition coefficients in olivine and orthopyroxene in all experiments. While there are some differences in the D values between olivine and orthopyroxene, they follow very similar trends. For experiments at high cooling rates there is an increase in the measured concentrations for incompatible trace elements in the crystals which yields apparent partition coefficients greater by up to 3 orders of magnitude from the equilibrium values obtained for isothermal equilibrium and slow cooling experiments. In contrast, compatible trace element D values are only slightly sensitive to cooling rate, typically varying by less than a factor of 2. SEM studies showed that melt inclusions were common in orthopyroxenes. It is shown that the increase in apparent D values for pyroxene observed with high cooling rates can be quantitatively explained by trapping of melt inclusions in crystals with equilibrium D values. Incorporation of melt inclusions may also quantitatively explain the increases in apparent D values in olivine at high cooling rates. However, no inclusions of melt were identified in olivine, even at the fastest cooling rate. If the high apparent D values obtained for olivine at high cooling rates were due to incorporation of trace elements in the lattice and not due to entrapment of melt, it would require incorporation of elements independent of valence and ionic radius. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Determining the oxygen fugacity of Earth's silicate mantle is of prime importance because it affects the speciation and mobility of volatile elements in the interior and has controlled the character of degassing species from the Earth since the planet's formation(1). Oxygen fugacities recorded by garnet-bearing peridotite xenoliths from Archaean lithosphere are of particular interest, because they provide constraints on the nature of volatile-bearing metasomatic fluids and melts active in the oldest mantle samples, including those in which diamonds are found(2,3). Here we report the results of experiments to test garnet oxythermobarometry equilibria(4,5) under high-pressure conditions relevant to the deepest mantle xenoliths. We present a formulation for the most successful equilibrium and use it to determine an accurate picture of the oxygen fugacity through cratonic lithosphere. The oxygen fugacity of the deepest rocks is found to be at least one order of magnitude more oxidized than previously estimated. At depths where diamonds can form, the oxygen fugacity is not compatible with the stability of either carbonate-or methane-rich liquid but is instead compatible with a metasomatic liquid poor in carbonate and dominated by either water or silicate melt. The equilibrium also indicates that the relative oxygen fugacity of garnet-bearing rocks will increase with decreasing depth during adiabatic decompression. This implies that carbon in the asthenospheric mantle will be hosted as graphite or diamond but will be oxidized to produce carbonatemelt through the reduction of Fe3+ in silicate minerals during upwelling. The depth of carbonate melt formation will depend on the ratio of Fe3+ to total iron in the bulk rock. This 'redox melting' relationship has important implications for the onset of geophysically detectable incipient melting and for the extraction of carbon dioxide from the mantle through decompressive melting.},

abstract = {Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd and in-situ clinopyroxene Sr and Pb isotope systematics, and mineral major and in-situ trace element compositions were obtained for a suite of non-diamond and diamond-bearing eclogites from the Diavik kimberlites (A154; 55??Ma old), Slave craton (Canada). Temperature estimates of last equilibration in the lithosphere for the non-diamond-bearing Diavik eclogites define two groups; low-temperature (800-1050????C) and high-temperature eclogites (1100-1300????C). Most diamond-eclogites indicate temperatures similar to those of the high-temperature eclogites. Isotopic and major and trace element systematics for the non-diamond- and diamond-bearing eclogites indicate overlapping chemical compositions suggesting similar rock formational histories. Calculated whole rock major and trace element abundances using chemical and modal abundances for constituent minerals exhibit broad similarities with mafic cumulates from ophiolite sequences. Most importantly the calculated whole rock eclogite compositions display positive Sr and Eu anomalies, typically interpreted as the result of plagioclase accumulation in cumulate rocks of oceanic crust sequences. Initial whole rock Hf isotopic values and in-situ Sr isotope data from clinopyroxene grains provide evidence that the eclogites were derived from precursor rocks with depleted mantle isotope characteristics. These combined results support the interpretation that the eclogites from Diavik represent remnants of subducted oceanic crust. Lu-Hf isotope systematics indicate that the oceanic protolith for the eclogites formed in the Paleoproterozoic at ??? 2.1??Ga, which is in agreement with the in-situ Pb isotope data from clinopyroxene. This result also corroborates the ??? 2.1??Ga Lu-Hf model ages recorded by mantle zircons from eclogite found within the Jericho kimberlite in the northern Slave Province (??? 200??km northwest of Diavik). The results from both studies indicate a link between eclogite formation and Paleoproterozoic subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the present-day western margin of the Archean Slave craton. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mineral/melt trace element partition coefficients were determined for rutile (TiO2) for a large number of trace elements (Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, V, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, REE, Cr, Sb, W, U, Th). Whilst the high field strength elements (Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) are compatible in rutile, other studied trace elements are incompatible (Sr, Th, REE). In all experiments we found DTa {\textgreater} DNb, DHf {\textgreater} DZr and DU {\textgreater} DTh. Partition coefficients for some polyvalent elements (Sb, W, and Co) were sensitive to oxygen fugacity. Melt composition exerts a strong influence on HFSE partition coefficients. With increasing polymerization of the melt, rutile/melt partition coefficients for the high field strength elements Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta increase about an order of magnitude. However, DNb/DTa and DHf/DZr are not significantly affected by melt composition. Because DU ≫ DTh, partial melting of rutile-bearing eclogite in subducted lithosphere may cause excesses of 230Th over 238U in some island arc lavas, whereas dehydration of subducted lithosphere may cause excesses of 238U over 230Th. From our partitioning results we infer partition coefficients for protactinium (Pa) which we predict to be much lower than previously anticipated. Contrary to previous studies, our data imply that rutile should not significantly influence observed 231Pa-235U disequilibria in certain volcanic rocks.},

The 29 exposed units have sharp contacts against each other and each of these units consists of three modally graded layers dominated by arfvedsonitic amphibole, eudialyte-group minerals, and alkali feldspar, respectively.This study uses field observations on changes in mineral orientation, recurrent mineral textures, compositional data from eudialyte-group minerals and amphibole, and settling rate calculations based on a modified Stokes' equation to explain the igneous layering of the kakortokites. We propose that the three major cumulus minerals (amphibole, eudialyte s.l., and alkali feldspar) were separated from each other by density contrasts, resulting in modally graded layers within each unit. The densest of these three minerals (amphibole) formed crystal mats within the cooling magma body. These crystal mats acted as barriers that inhibited large-scale vertical migration of melts and crystals with increasing effectiveness over time. The sub-volumes of magma captured in between the crystal mats evolved largely as geochemically independent sub-systems, as indicated by the observed trends in mineral composition.},

Assuming minimal fractionation on incorporation into biotite, these data imply an ultimate crustal source for the Cl. However, field, petrographic, and isotopic evidence suggests that high-Cl fluids did not infiltrate from the country rocks after emplacement of the Stillwater magma, nor was the Cl-isotopic signature the result of assimilation of Cl-rich crustal rocks. Stillwater parent magmas have boninitic affinities and can be modeled as second-stage melts from a metasomatically enriched, depleted mantle. We propose that the early melt-extraction event depleted the mantle in F and Cl. Subsequent metasomatism by a Cl-rich agent with a crustal Cl isotopic signature, probably a fluid, produced a source rock with a high Cl/F ratio. In modern magmas, high Cl/F weight ratios are associated with high overall volatile contents, suggesting that the Stillwater Complex and other high-Cl layered intrusions crystallized from magmas that may have contained in excess of 1 wt{\%} water.},

abstract = {Partition coefficients for compatible and incompatible trace elements for use in modelling the origin and evolution of lamproitic and other potassic rocks are reported. These are based on values obtained by in situ determination using laser ablation microprobe- inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LAM-ICP-MS) on mineral/ glass pairs in examples of the Gaussberg olivine leucitite, a classic leucite lamproite. Leucite/melt partition coefficients for 32 elements show values above 1 only for Cs and Rb, whereas values for Ni, Ga and Co are 0.4-0.1. DLc/Lq for most other elements are in the range 0.07-0.0005, and delineate a gently sloping pattern to lower values for elements generally considered to be "incompatible". Olivine/melt partition coefficients show higher values for the compatible elements Ni, Co, Mn and Cr than in all basaltic systems investigated experimentally to date. DOl/Lq for heavy rare earth elements (HREE) are slightly lower than in basalts, whereas most other elements give similar values. Clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients appear to vary widely as a function of the Al2O3 content of the rock. Values obtained here for the Gaussberg rock consistently show appreciably higher DCpx/Lq than in basaltic systems for the incompatible elements Cs, Rb, Ba, Th, U, Nb, Ta, La and Ce, which is attributed to a larger M2 site. Early salitic cores have patterns with lower D-values for these elements and higher values for HREE, similar to those known from alumina-rich potassic rocks. Thus, the values obtained here should be applied only with caution to nonlamproitic rocks.

abstract = {The Late Archaean-Early Proterozoic Transvaal Sequence is preserved within the Transvaal, Kanye and Griqualand West basins, with the 2050 Ma Bushveld Complex intrusive into the upper portion of the succession within the Transvaal basin. Both Transvaal and Bushveld rocks are extensively mineralized, the former containing large deposits of iron, manganese, asbestos, andalusite, gold, fluorine, lead, zinc and tin ores, and the latter some of the World's major occurrences of PGE, chromium and vanadium ores. Transvaal sedimentation began with thin, predominantly elastic sedimentary rocks (Black Reef-Vryburg Formations) which grade up into a thick package of carbonate rocks and BIF (Chuniespoort-Ghaap-Taupone Groups). These lithologies reflect a carbonate-BIF platform sequence which covered much of the Kaapvaal craton, in reaction to thermal subsidence above Ventersdorp-aged rift-related fault systems. An erosional hiatus was followed by deposition of the elastic sedimentary rocks and volcanics of the Pretoria-Postmasburg-Segwagwa Groups within the three basins, under largely closed-basin conditions. An uppermost predominantly volcanic succession (Rooiberg Group-Loskop Formation) is restricted to the Transvaal basin. A common continental rift setting is thought to have controlled Pretoria Group sedimentation, Rooiberg volcanism and the intrusion of the mafic rocks of the Rustenburg Layered Suite of the Bushveld Complex. The dipping sheets of the Rustenburg magmas cut across the upper Pretoria Group stratigraphy and lifted up the Rooiberg lithologies to form the roof to the complex. Subsequent granitic rocks of the Lebowa and Rashoop Suites of the Bushveld Complex intruded both upper Rustenburg rocks and the Rooiberg felsites.},

abstract = {In-situ Hf isotope analyses and U–Pb dates were obtained by laser ablation-MC-ICP-MS for a zircon-bearing mantle eclogite xenolith from the diamondiferous Jericho kimberlite located within the Archean Slave Province (Nunavut), Canada. The U–Pb zircon results yield a wide range of ages (∼2.0 to 0.8 Ga) indicating a complex geological history. Of importance, one zircon yields a U–Pb upper intercept date of 1989 ± 67 Ma, providing a new minimum age constraint for zircon crystallization and eclogite formation. In contrast, Hf isotope systematics for the same zircons display an intriguing uniformity, and corresponding Hf depleted mantle model ages range between 2.1 ± 0.1 and 2.3 ± 0.1 Ga; the youngest Hf model age is within error to the oldest U–Pb date.

The Jericho eclogites have previously been interpreted as representing remnants of metamorphosed oceanic crust, and their formation related to Paleoproterozoic subduction regimes along the western margin of the Archean Slave craton during the Wopmay orogeny. Hf isotope compositions and U–Pb results for the Jericho zircons reported here are in good agreement with a Paleoproterozoic subduction model, suggesting that generation of oceanic crust and eclogite formation occurred between 2.0 and 2.1 Ga. The slightly older Hf depleted mantle model ages (∼2.1 to 2.3 Ga) may be reconciled with this model by invoking mixing between ‘crustal'-derived Hf from sediments and more radiogenic Hf associated with the oceanic crust during the ∼2 Ga subduction event. This results in intermediate Hf isotope compositions for the Jericho zircons that yield ‘fictitiously' older Hf model ages.},

abstract = {Apatite-group phosphates are nearly ubiquitous in carbonatites, but our understanding of these minerals is inadequate, particularly in the areas of element partitioning and petrogenetic interpretation of their compositional variation among spatially associated rocks and within individual crystals. In the present work, the mode of occurrence, and major- and trace-element chemistry of apatite (sensu lato) from calcite and dolomite carbonatites, their associated cumulate rocks (including phoscorites) and hydrothermal parageneses were studied using a set of 80 samples from 50 localities worldwide. The majority of this set represents material for which no analytical data are available in the literature. Electron-microprobe and laser-ablation mass-spectrometry data ({\~{}} 600 and 400 analyses, respectively), accompanied by back-scattered-electron and cathodoluminescence images and Raman spectra, were used to identify the key compositional characteristics and zoning patterns of carbonatitic apatite. These data are placed in the context of phosphorus geochemistry in carbonatitic systems and carbonatite evolution, and compared to the models proposed by previous workers. The documented variations in apatite morphology and zoning represent a detailed record of a wide range of evolutionary processes, both magmatic and fluid-driven. The majority of igneous apatite from the examined rocks is Cl-poor fluorapatite or F-rich hydroxylapatite (≥ 0.3 apfu F) with 0.2–2.7 wt.{\%} SrO, 0–4.5 wt.{\%} LREE2O3, 0–0.8 wt.{\%} Na2O, and low levels of other cations accommodated in the Ca site (up to 1000 ppm Mn, 2300 ppm Fe, 200 ppm Ba, 150 ppm Pb, 700 ppm Th and 150 ppm U), none of which show meaningful correlation with the host-rock type. Silicate, (SO4)2 −and (VO4)3 −anions, substituting for (PO4)3 −, tend to occur in greater abundance in crystals from calcite carbonatites (up to 4.2 wt.{\%} SiO2, 1.5 wt.{\%} SO3and 660 ppm V). Although (CO3)2 −groups are very likely present in some samples, Raman micro-spectroscopy proved inconclusive for apatites with small P-site deficiencies and other substituent elements in this site. Indicator REE ratios sensitive to redox conditions ($\delta$Ce, $\delta$Eu) and hydrothermal overprint ($\delta$Y) form a fairly tight cluster of values (0.8–1.3, 0.8–1.1 and 0.6–0.9, respectively) and may be used in combination with trace-element abundances for the development of geochemical exploration tools. Hydrothermal apatite forms in carbonatites as the product of replacement of primary apatite, or is deposited in fractures and interstices as euhedral crystals and aggregates associated with typical late-stage minerals (e.g., quartz and chlorite). Hydrothermal apatite is typically depleted in Sr, REE, Mn and Th, but enriched in F (up to 4.8 wt.{\%}) relative to its igneous precursor, and also differs from the latter in at least some of key REE ratios [e.g., shows (La/Yb)cn≤ 25, or a negative Ce anomaly]. The only significant exception is Sr(± REE,Na)-rich replacement zones and overgrowths on igneous apatite from some dolomite(-bearing) carbonatites. Their crystallization conditions and source fluid appear to be very different from the more common Sr-REE-depleted variety. Based on the new evidence presented in this work, trace-element partitioning between apatite and carbonatitic magmas, phosphate solubility in these magmas, and compositional variation of apatite-group minerals from spatially associated carbonatitic rocks are critically re-evaluated.},

abstract = {Combined whole-rock and zircon MC-ICP-MS Lu–Hf isotope data are reported for a large collection of Archean granitoids belonging to typical tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) suites. Our data demonstrate that the time-integrated Lu/Hf of the mantle source of TTGs has not significantly changed over the last 4 Gy. Continents therefore most likely grew from nearly primordial unfractionated material extracted from the deep mantle via rising plumes that left a depleted melt residue in the upper mantle. The deep mantle could retain its primitive relative element abundances over time because sinking plates are largely stripped barren of their oceanic and continental crust components at subduction zones; this process results in only small proportions ({\textless}15–25{\%}) of present-day continental mass getting recycled to great depths. Zircon populations extracted from the analyzed TTGs have Hf isotopic compositions broadly consistent with those of their host whole-rocks, whereas the U–Pb system in the same grains is often disturbed, causing a discrepancy that creates spurious initial $\epsilon$Hf values. This problem is endemic to the Archean detrital zircon record and consistent with experimental results bearing on the relative retentivity of Hf vs. U and Pb in zircon. We argue that this behavior biases the Archean zircon record toward negative $\epsilon$Hf values, which are at odds with the present TTG data set. If Hadean Jack Hills zircons are considered in light of these results, the mantle source of continents has remained unchanged for the last 4.3 Gy.},

abstract = {Spinel-bearing peridotitic mantle xenoliths from the 1949 eruption on La Palma were modified mineralogically and chemically during prolonged reaction with their host magma. The magmatism that brought the peridotites to the surface caused two distinct generations of xenolith fractures: (1) Old fractures are characterized by crystalline selvages with cumulus textures towards the host magma, or by polymineralic veins. They are accompanied by 0.9–2 mm wide diffusion zones where peridotite olivine became less forsteritic through diffusive exchange with the host magma. Old fractures represent most of each xenolith's surface. (2) Young fractures show no selvages and only narrow diffusion zones of {\textless}0.02 mm width. Calculations based on a model of Fe-Mg interdiffusion give an age of 6 to 83 years and {\textless}4 days for old and young fractures, respectively. A combination of these data with fluid inclusion barometry indicates that selvages and veins formed during xenolith transport rather than representing wall-rock reactions or mantle metasomatism. The results provide ample evidence for prolonged storage of the xenoliths in the crust, constraining a multi-stage magma ascent: Years to decades prior to eruption, ascending magma ruptured peridotitic wall-rock possibly through hydraulic fracturing and stoping around magma reservoirs. Magma batches transported the peridotite xenoliths to the crust at ascent rates exceeding 0.2 ms−1. The xenoliths and their host magma stagnated during at least 6 years in possibly sill-like reservoirs at 7–11 km depth. The xenoliths became deposited and subsequently embedded in a mush of settled phenocrysts, while selvages and veins crystallized until the eruption commenced. At the end of the eruption, the xenoliths were finally transported to the surface within hours to days. Decompression during the rapid ascent induced internal stresses and caused renewed fragmentation of the xenoliths, producing the young fractures.},

abstract = {U-He dating, which during its history has been very problematic, might find special application in the field of hydrothermal mineralizations where other methods generally fail. The mineral apatite is a potential candidate for this method. In order to shed light on various aspects of apatite dating by the (U + Th)/He method, two samples each from different geochemical environments (plutonic, pneumatolytic and hydrothermal) were probed. Isotope dilution techniques were used for concentration analyses from which 4He model dates, also called "helium indices" after N.B. Keevil, were calculated. 4He diffusion measurements were carried out for comparison of the 4He retentivities between the samples. Comparisons of the apatite He indices with plausible reference ages of the sampling locations in combination with results obtained from diffusion experiments show that the (U + Th)/He dating method applied to apatite yields an age of cooling rather than an emplacement age. The calculated closure temperatures are similar to those obtained by the fission-track method (∼ 100°C). Our results suggest that the high-temperature apatites (plutonic and pneumatolytic) may be more suitable for He dating than hydrothermal apatite. Important criteria for the dating of apatite by (U + Th)/He are the presence of moderate radionuclide concentrations (tens of ppm) and a minimum abundance of inclusions. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Major and trace element data on basanitic to phonolitic lavas of different ages and from different parts of Tenerife (Canary Islands), and their mafic silicates have been used to obtain more detailed information about processes taking place in crustal magma chambers associated with ocean island magmatism in Tenerife. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts in basanitic to phonolitic lavas consist of diopside–salite (referred to as Al-salite) with alternating normal and reverse zoning, and commonly contain a rounded or corroded core of homogeneous Na-rich diopside–salite (referred to as Na-salite). In general Al-salite contains lower amounts of rare earth elements (REE) and Y, and more Mg, Al, Ti, Cr, Sc and Ni than Na-salite. Variations in trace element concentrations and ratios are only weakly related to variations in mg-number. Petrographic and compositional relations among the lavas and mafic silicates are interpreted as the results of fractional crystallization in periodically refilled magma chambers (FCM processes). The FCM processes took place at temperatures of 1040–1260°C and pressures of about 0.2–0.5 GPa; that is, partly within the old oceanic crust and partly within the overlying sequence of Canary Islands lavas. FCM processes may lead to significant fractionation between incompatible trace elements whose ratios in mafic magmas are used to characterize their mantle source(s). Melts subjected to FCM processes will, furthermore, produce significantly larger masses of cumulates than melts of similar mg-number that have only been subjected to simple fractional crystallization.},

abstract = {Accessory minerals commonly occur attached to or included in the major crystalline phases of felsic and some intermediate igneous rocks. Apatite is particularly common as inclusions, but Fe-Ti oxides, pyrrhotite, zircon, monazite, chevkinite and xenotime are also known from silicic rocks. Accessories may nucleate near the host crystal/ liquid interface as a result of local saturation owing to formation of a differentiated chemical boundary layer in which accessory mineral solubility would be lower than in the surrounding liquid. Differentiation of this boundary layer would be greatest adjacent to ferromagnesian phenocrysts, especially Fe-Ti oxides; it is with oxides that accessories are most commonly associated in rocks. A boundary layer may develop if the crystal grows more rapidly than diffusion can transport incorporated and rejected elements to and from the phenocryst. Diffusion must dominate over convection as a mode of mass transfer near the advancing crystal/liquid interface in order for a boundary layer to exist. Accumulation of essential structural constituent elements of accessory minerals owing to their slow diffusion in evolved silicate melt also may force local saturation, but this is not a process that applies to all cases. Local saturation is an attractive mechanism for enhancing fractionation during crystallization differentiation. If accessory minerals attached to or included in phenocrysts formed because of local saturation, their host phenocrysts must have grown rapidly when accessories nucleated in comparison to lifetimes of magma reservoirs. Some inconsistencies remain in a local saturation origin for accessory phases that cannot be evaluated without additional information. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Equilibrium and dynamic crystallization experiments were used to determine distribution coefficients (D-values) for the REE and the trace elements Sc, V, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, Hf, Th, and U between Ti-Al-clinopyroxene and melt. Equilibrium values for D correlate well with previous studies where values have been determined. The D-values were also studied as a function of cooling rate. Increased cooling rates produce higher growth rates. At growth rates that exceed the diffusion rates in the crystals, the D-values increase to near unity and the HREE D-values exceed unity only at the most rapid crystal growth rates. The increase in D-values is the result of the inclusion of components into the growing pyroxene from the boundary layer that develops at the crystal-melt interface because of the disparity between the growth and diffusion rates. The origin of sector zoning is best explained as an interplay of primarily crystallographic control with kinetic effects.},

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Antarctica, is a large (3794 m) alkaline open-conduit stratovolcano that hosts a vigorously convecting and persistently degassing lake of anorthoclase phonolite magma. The composition of the lake was investigated by analyzing glass and mineral compositions in lava bombs erupted between 1972 and 2004. Matrix glass, titanomagnetite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and fluor-apatite compositions are invariant and show that the magmatic temperature (∼ 1000°C) and oxygen fugacity ($\Delta$logFMQ = − 0.9) have been stable. Large temperature variations at the lake surface ({\~{}} 400–500°C) are not reflected in mineral compositions. Anorthoclase phenocrysts up to 10 cm in length feature a restricted compositional range (An10.3–22.9Ab62.8–68.1Or11.4–27.2) with complex textural and compositional zoning. Anorthoclase textures and compositions indicate crystallization occurs at low degrees of effective undercooling. We propose shallow water exsolution causes crystallization and shallow convection cycles the anorthoclase crystals through many episodes of growth resulting in their exceptional size. Minor variations in eruptive activity from 1972 to 2004 are decoupled from magma compositions. The variations probably relate to changes in conduit geometry within the volcano and/or variable input of CO2-rich volatiles into the upper-level magma chamber from deeper in the system. Eleven bulk samples of phonolite lava from the summit plateau that range in age from 0 ± 4 ka to 17 ± 8 ka were analyzed for major and trace elements. Small compositional variations are controlled by anorthoclase content. The lavas are indistinguishable from modern bulk lava bomb compositions and demonstrate that Erebus volcano has been erupting lava and tephra from the summit region with the same bulk composition for ∼ 17 ka.},

abstract = {Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands), have undergone several flank and central vent, lava flow and explosive phonolitic eruptions during the last 35 ka, without any apparent structural or petrological control on such a random location of eruption foci. The morphology and size of the volcanic edifices have been changing during that period, but this seems to have not affected the location of new eruptions. In order to investigate what determines the occurrence of either central or flank eruptions at Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, we have performed several numerical experiments considering a wide range of situations in which the main physical conditions (topography, size, depth and shape of the magma chambers, presence of deviatoric stresses, internal structure) of the volcanic system have been changed. The results obtained show that the main control on the pathway that magma will follow to leave the chamber and reach the surface is exerted by the stress field distribution around the chamber, which is a function of the shape of the chamber. This suggests that in the case of Teide-Pico Viejo, where there is not a preferential location for new vents, each new phonolitic eruption is preceded by the modification of the existing magma chamber (or the emplacement of a new batch of magma) that does not necessarily matches the structure of the previous one. The presence of multiple shallow reservoirs containing eruptible magma also influences the stresses distribution around the erupting magma chamber. The numerical results also show that the existence of an extensional stress field plays a significant role in determining the position of the phonolitic feeder dykes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Patricia Clay and co-authors show that the abundances of these heavy halogens in carbonaceous, enstatite, Rumuruti and ordinary chondrites are much lower than reported previously. The authors also find that the Br/Cl and I/Cl ratios in all the chondrites studied show a limited range, indistinguishable from bulk silicate Earth estimates. This indicates that the depletion of halogens relative to primitive meteorites is consistent with lithophile elements of similar volatility. They conclude that the observed terrestrial halogen inventories cannot be explained by late accretion alone, but also require the efficient extraction of halogen-rich fluids from the solid Earth during the earliest stages of its formation.},

abstract = {It is firmly established that giant landslides play a key role in the evolution of ocean island volcanoes. On- and off-shore studies of e.g. R{\'{e}}union Island, the Hawaiian, Canarian, and Cape Verdean archipelagoes confirm enormous landslide volumes up to thousands of km3 and runout distances frequently exceeding a hundred km [1]. Accelerated post-collapse volcanism has been witnessed at strato-volcanoes (e.g. Bezymianny, Mt. St. Helens), but may also be common for shield-volcanoes (Waianae, Oahu [2]; Teno, Tenerife [3]). The extent of this phenomenon and its consequences for the magmatic plumbing system of the volcanic edifice are poorly constrained. Between 15-134 ka, the El Golfo giant lateral collapse removed a 150-180 km3 sector of the volcanic edifice of El Hierro, the youngest and westernmost of the Canary Islands. Although no major volcanic edifice has been established since the collapse, post-El Golfo landslide volcanic vents concentrate at the base of the collapse scarp while additonal eruptions occurred along the triaxial rift system of the island [4]. Whilst pre- collapse volcanics include relatively differentiated rocks (up to trachytes, SiO2 {\~{}}55 wt{\%}, MgO {\~{}}1.5 wt{\%} [4]), a drastic change in the volcanic regime is reflected in the post-collapse eruptions of crystal-rich (up to 60 volume {\%}, with megacrysts up to 3 cm in size) lava flows and pyroclastics (basanites, ankaramites, and picrites, SiO2 {\textless}45 wt{\%}, MgO = 6-15 wt{\%}). Chemical thermobarometry [5] using augite and olivine (Fo 71-81) rims, fused groundmass, and whole rock compositions of post-collapse samples indicates that crystallisation mostly occurred in the uppermost mantle at pressures and temperatures in the range of 7-13 kbar and 1150-1250°C, respectively. Most volcanics include several crystal populations, including complex normal and reverse zonation patterns. Narrow outer rims (last {\~{}}20 $\mu$m) of the augite and olivine crystals commonly show a sharp decrease in Mg{\#} (from {\~{}}80 to {\~{}}70). We propose that the decompression of the magma plumbing system following the El Golfo giant lateral collapse may have triggered rapid ascent of melts stored at depth, causing mixing of multiple magma batches and the aggregation of their crystal populations. The last stage, involving steep normal zonation at the rims of many augite and olivine crystals may be attributed to a `sudden' change in the P-T conditions and/or the melt chemical composition.

abstract = {El Hierro eruption started on 10 October 2011 after an unrest episode that initiated on 17 July 2011. This is the first eruption in the Canary Islands that has been tracked in real time. Although being submarine and not directly observable, the data recorded allowed its reconstruction and to identify its causes and mechanisms. Seismicity, surface deformation, and petrological data indicate that a batch of basanitic magma coming from a reservoir located at a depth of about 25 km below the El Hierro Island was emplaced at shallower depth creating a new reservoir about 10–12 km above, where magma evolved until the initiation of the eruption. The characteristics of seismicity and surface deformation suggest that the necessary space to accumulate magma at this shallower position, which coincides with the crust/mantle boundary beneath El Hierro, was created in about 2 months by elastic deformation and magma-driven fracturing of the crust. After this first intrusion episode, part of the magma started to migrate laterally toward the SE for nearly 20 km, always keeping the same depth and following a path apparently controlled by stress barriers created by tectonic and rheological contrasts in the upper lithosphere. This lateral migration of magma ended with a submarine eruption at about 5 km offshore from the southern corner of El Hierro Island. The total seismic energy released during the unrest episode was of 8.1 × 1011 J, and the total uplift previous to the onset of the eruption was of 40 mm. Combining geological, geophysical, and petrological data and numerical modeling, we propose a volcanological model of the causes and mechanisms of El Hierro eruption that shows how the stress distribution in the crust beneath El Hierro, which was influenced by rheological contrasts, tectonic stresses, and gravitational loading, controlled the movement and eruption of magma. We also discuss the implications of this model in terms of eruption forecast in the Canary Islands.},

abstract = {Melt extraction from the Earth's mantle requires some form of channelized flow to produce the observed disequilibrium between the crust-forming lavas and their mantle sources. In this review, we discuss the influence of deformation on melt-extraction processes, with an emphasis on the understanding gained from a wide range of laboratory experimental investigations. Rheological properties of partially molten rocks are very sensitive to melt distribution, and melt distribution is profoundly influenced by deviatoric stress in a viscously deforming partially molten rock, establishing a coupling between deformation and melt distribution. During deformation, this coupling can lead to organization of melt into melt-enriched shear zones at length scales longer than the grain size. We discuss the current state of understanding of this process, with some speculation on its role in the ensemble of processes that constitute melt extraction from the Earth.},

abstract = {Earth's residual geoid is dominated by a degree-2 mode, with elevated regions above large low shear-wave velocity provinces on the core–mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific. The edges of these deep mantle bodies, when projected radially to the Earth's surface, correlate with the reconstructed positions of large igneous provinces and kimberlites since Pangea formed about 320 million years ago. Using this surface-to-core–mantle boundary correlation to locate continents in longitude and a novel iterative approach for defining a paleomagnetic reference frame corrected for true polar wander, we have developed a model for absolute plate motion back to earliest Paleozoic time (540 Ma). For the Paleozoic, we have identified six phases of slow, oscillatory true polar wander during which the Earth's axis of minimum moment of inertia was similar to that of Mesozoic times. The rates of Paleozoic true polar wander ({\textless}1°/My) are compatible with those in the Mesozoic, but absolute plate velocities are, on average, twice as high. Our reconstructions generate geologically plausible scenarios, with large igneous provinces and kimberlites sourced from the margins of the large low shear-wave velocity provinces, as in Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. This absolute kinematic model suggests that a degree-2 convection mode within the Earth's mantle may have operated throughout the entire Phanerozoic.},

abstract = {Mineral and whole-rock chemical data for peridotite xenoliths in basaltic lavas on Spitsbergen are examined to reassess mechanisms of melt–fluid interaction with peridotites and their relative role versus melt composition in mantle metasomatism. The enrichment patterns in the xenoliths on primitive mantle-normalized diagrams range from Th–La–Ce ‘inflections' in weakly metasomatized samples (normally without amphibole) to a continuous increase in abundances from Ho to Ce typical for amphibole-bearing xenoliths. Numerical modelling of interaction between depleted peridotites and enriched melts indicates that these patterns do not result from simple mixing of the two end-members but can be explained by chromatographic fractionation during reactive porous melt flow, which produces a variety of enrichment patterns in a single event. Many metasomatized xenoliths have negative high field strength element and Pb anomalies and Sr spikes relative to rare earth elements of similar compatibility, and highly fractionated Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf. Although amphibole precipitation can produce Nb–Ta anomalies, some of these features cannot be attributed to percolation-related fractionation alone and have to be a signature of the initial melt (possibly carbonate rich). In general, chemical and mineralogical fingerprints of a metasomatic medium are strongest near its source (e.g. a vein) whereas element patterns farther in the metasomatic ‘column' are increasingly controlled by fractionation mechanisms.},

abstract = {This paper reports the first in situ magnetic hysteresis measurements of pseudo-single-domain (PSD) magnetite under high pressure up to 1 GPa. The magnetic hysteresis measurements of stoichiometric PSD magnetite samples under hydrostatic pressure were carried out using a piston-cylinder high-pressure cell, and the pressure dependence of the hysteresis parameters of PSD magnetite was calculated from the hysteresis curves. It was found that coercivity (Bc) increases with increasing pressure as a quadratic function up to 1 GPa by 90{\%}, which is different from the pressure dependences of Bc of multidomain and singledomain magnetites. Coercivity of remanence also increases as a quadratic function, and saturation remanence (Mrs) increases with pressure up to 0.5 GPa by 20{\%} until reaching saturation. In contrast, saturation magnetization is constant up to 1 GPa. The approximate demagnetizing factor calculated from the ratio Bc/Mrs increases with increasing pressure, suggesting that the number of lamellar domains increases with increasing pressure. The number of lamellar domains and domain wall width are theoretically estimated to increase under high pressure due to the changes in magnetostriction, elastic, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants, and these changes in magnetic domain structure should relate to the changes in the magnetic properties of PSD magnetite.},

abstract = {The origin of the mantle sources of the Na-alkaline magmas erupted within the continental rift of the Sicily Channel and their melting behaviour are here investigated through the determination of Sr, Nd and Pb isotope ratios and U-series disequilibria on basaltic volcanic rocks from Linosa and Pantelleria. The isotope data, along with trace element ratios are used to assess the possible role of the interaction with the continental crust and/or the Sub-Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM). The data show little variation in Sr and Nd isotopes and a continuous trend toward more radiogenic Pb isotope composition from Linosa to the oldest mafic activity of Pantelleria (i.e. Paleo-Pantelleria), with intermediate values measured in the youngest Pantelleria lavas (Neo-Pantelleria). Pantelleria basalts have ubiquitous 230Th-excess ranging from 7{\%} to 20{\%}. These data suggest the magmas are originated within the asthenospheric mantle, with little or no interaction with either the continental crust or the SCLM. The increasing FOZO-like character of the studied magmas and the variation of some key trace element ratios (e.g. Rb/La) argue for an increasing role of recycled oceanic material in the form of eclogite/pyroxenite dispersed within the mantle sources of these magmas. A completely distinct isotope composition is recorded in Neo-Pantelleria hawaiites from Khartibucale, which show significantly higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb, (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th), but comparable (230Th/238U) with respect to all the other rocks studied. These rocks cannot be considered co-genetic with other Pantelleria basalts and are interpreted either as related to interaction with partial melts of the SCLM or to be originated from a mantle source enriched by recycled crustal material (EM-like). 235U–231Pa disequilibria were also measured in one Neo-Pantelleria hawaiite and one Neo-Pantelleria basalt. The coupled (230Th/238U) = 1.20 and (231Pa/235U) = 1.39 of the latter were used to perform quantitative dynamic melting models in order to constrain physical parameters of mantle melting in the Sicily Channel. The combined modelling yielded positive solutions only for high DU/DTh (≥ 2.5) and low melting rates ($\Gamma$ {\textless} 1 × 10− 4 kg/m3/a). These data argue against any important role for amphibole in the genesis of these magmas and are consistent with a peridotite source possibly well mixed with recycled components. The modelled values of $\Gamma$ can also be converted into estimates of the upwelling rate of the mantle that are compatible with slow passive upwelling along the Sicily Channel rift.},

abstract = {The Ethiopian plateau is made up of several distinct volcanic centres of different ages and magmatic affinities. In the NE, a thick sequence of 30 Ma flood basalts is overlain by the 30 Ma Simien shield volcano. The flood basalts and most of this shield volcano, except for a thin veneer of alkali basalt, are tholeiitic. In the centre of the province, a far thinner sequence of flood basalt is overlain by the 22 Ma Choke and Guguftu shield volcanoes. Like the underlying flood basalts, these shields are composed of alkaline lavas. A third type of magma, which also erupted at 30 Ma, is more magnesian, alkaline and strongly enriched in incompatible trace elements. Eruption of this magma was confined to the NE of the province, a region where the lava flows are steeply tilted as a result of deformation contemporaneous with their emplacement. Younger shields (e.g. Mt Guna, 10{\textperiodcentered}7 Ma) are composed of Si-undersaturated lavas. The three main types of magma have very different major and trace element characteristics ranging from compositions low in incompatible elements in the tholeiites [e.g. 10 ppm La at 7 wt {\%} MgO (=La7), La/Yb = 4{\textperiodcentered}2], moderate in the alkali basalts (La7 = 24, La/Yb = 9{\textperiodcentered}2), and very high in the magnesian alkaline magmas (La7 = 43, La/Yb = 17). Although their Nd and Sr isotope compositions are similar, Pb isotopic compositions vary considerably; 206Pb/204Pb varies in the range of ∼17{\textperiodcentered}9–18{\textperiodcentered}6 in the tholeiites and ∼19{\textperiodcentered}0–19{\textperiodcentered}6 in the 22 Ma shields. A conventional model of melting in a mantle plume, or series of plumes, cannot explain the synchronous eruption of incompatible-element-poor tholeiites and incompatible-element-rich alkali lavas, the large range of Pb isotope compositions and the broad transition from tholeiitic to alkali magmatism during a period of continental rifting. The lithospheric mantle played only a passive role in the volcanism and does not represent a major source of magma. The mantle source of the Ethiopian volcanism can be compared with the broad region of mantle upwelling in the South Pacific that gave rise to the volcanic islands of French Polynesia. Melting in large hotter-than-average parts of the Ethiopian superswell produced the flood basalts; melting in small compositionally distinct regions produced the magmas that fed the shield volcanoes.},

Memberg is unusual in that it is highly-welded, exhibits large-scale rheomorphic structures, contains huge lithic clasts, and has near-vertical foliation where it adheres to cliffs and caldera walls. Granulometric data from the members identified in the field as ignimbrites confirms this conclusion, as do density profiles through the various members.},

abstract = {The Ninetyeast Ridge is an ∼5500 km long, north–south-oriented, submarine volcanic ridge in the eastern Indian Ocean that formed from magmatism associated with the deep-seated Kerguelen mantle plume as the Indian plate drifted rapidly northward during the Late Cretaceous. Basalts recovered along the ridge have the characteristic Dupal geochemical signature of Indian Ocean basalts, but debate concerning the nature and number of components in their mantle source persists. New multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Pb, Hf) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (Sr, Nd) isotopic analyses were obtained for tholeiites representative of the ∼180 m of basaltic basement recovered from three drill sites (Site 758, 82 Ma; Site 757, 58 Ma; Site 756, 43 Ma) along the Ninetyeast Ridge during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 121. No systematic isotopic variation is observed along the ridge, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis of an aging mantle plume origin for the ridge. The isotopic compositions are generally intermediate between those of the volcanic products of the Kerguelen and Amsterdam–St. Paul hotspots and define mixing trends between components with relatively enriched and depleted signatures. At least three, possibly four, source components are required to explain the observed isotopic variability along the Ninetyeast Ridge. The unradiogenic signatures of some Ninetyeast Ridge basalts (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr = 0{\textperiodcentered}70381–0{\textperiodcentered}70438) are not related to the source of Indian MORB and indicate the presence of a relatively depleted component in a deep mantle source. A similar source component is also identified in other Indian Ocean island basalts (e.g. Crozet, R{\'{e}}union) not related to magmatic activity of the Kerguelen hotspot. The Pb–Hf–Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the Ninetyeast Ridge basalts are consistent with the presence of a mixture of recycled sediments and lower continental crust together with altered oceanic crust in their mantle source, hence supporting a deep origin for the enriched Dupal signature encountered in ocean island basalts.},

This layer is observed downdip of the inferred locked seismogenic zone, in the region of episodic tremor and slip. Laboratory velocity measurements of crystalline rock samples made at 200 MPa confining pressure and elevated pore pressures demonstrate that Vp/Vs increases with increasing fluid-filled porosity. The observed high Vp/Vs values are best explained by pore fluids under near lithostatic pressure in a layer with a high porosity of 2.7{\%}–4.0{\%}. Such large volumes of fluid take ∼1 m.y. to accumulate based on reasonable rates of metamorphic fluid production of ∼10−4 m3/(m2 yr) in subducting Juan de Fuca crust and mantle. Accordingly, the permeability of the plate interface at these depths must be very low, ∼10−24 to ∼10−21 m2, or the porous layer must have a permeability {\textless}3 × 10−20 m2.},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the lithospheric architecture of Africa, and its evolution from ca. 3.6 Ga to the present. Upper-lithosphere domains, generated or reworked in different time periods, have been delineated by integrating regional tectonics and geochronology with geophysical data (magnetic, gravity, and seismic). The origins and evolution of lower-lithosphere domains are interpreted from a high-resolution global shear-wave tomographic model, using thermal/compositional modeling and xenolith/xenocryst data from volcanic rocks. These data are integrated to map the distribution of ancient highly depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), zones of younger or strongly modified SCLM and zones of active mantle upwelling, and to relate these to the evolution of the upper lithosphere domains. The lithospheric architecture of Africa consists of several Archean cratons and smaller cratonic fragments, stitched together and flanked by younger fold belts; the continental assembly as we see it has only existed since lower Paleozoic time. The larger cratons are underlain by geochemically depleted, rigid, and mechanically robust SCLM; these cratonic roots have steep sides, extending in some cases to {\&}ge;300-km depth. Beneath smaller cratons (e.g., Kaapvaal) extensive refertilization has reduced the lateral and vertical extent of strongly depleted SCLM. Some cratonic roots extend {\&}ge;300 km into the Atlantic Ocean, suggesting that the upper lithosphere may detach during continental breakup, leaving fragments of SCLM scattered in the ocean basin. The cratonic margins, and some intracratonic domain boundaries, have played a major role in the tectonics of Africa. They have repeatedly focused ascending magmas, leading to refertilization and weakening of the SCLM. These boundaries have localized successive cycles of extension, rifting, and renewed accretion; the ongoing development of the East Africa Rift and its branches is only the latest stage in this process. The less depleted SCLM that underlies some accretionary belts may have been generated in Archean time, and repeatedly refertilized by the passage of magmas during younger tectonic events. Our analysis indicates that originally Archean SCLM is far more extensive beneath Africa than previously recognized, and implies that post-Archean SCLM rarely survives the collision/accretion process. Where continental crust and SCLM have remained connected, there is a strong linkage between the tectonic evolution of the crust and the composition and modification of its underlying SCLM.},

abstract = {Studies of natural fluid inclusions have shown that Cu commonly occurs at higher concentrations in vapor-type inclusions than in coexisting brine inclusions, a phenomenon which has been interpreted to arise from copper partitioning into the vapor phase. In the first part of this study, we attempted to experimentally reproduce this behavior in hydrothermal experiments covering a range of P–T conditions (600–800 °C, 70–130 MPa), fluid compositions (NaCl ± KCl ± FeCl2; 0.5–6.6 wt.{\%} S), fluid acidities (quench fluid pH ⩽0.3–10), and sulfur speciation (H2S-dominated to SO2-dominated). However, as in several other studies we did not succeed in reproducing conditions under which Cu partitions into the vapor phase. In view of recent observations that quartz-hosted fluid inclusions can diffusively loose or gain Cu after entrapment, we set out to determine if the evidence from natural fluid inclusions could be compromised. For this purpose we synthesized vapor and brine inclusions from Cu–H2O–NaCl–S fluids at 800 °C/130 MPa and re-equilibrated them in slightly different fluids at 800 °C/70 MPa, measuring some inclusions by LA-ICP-MS after each step. Vapor inclusions indeed experienced a dramatic increase in Cu from 0.3 ± 0.03 to 5.7 ± 3.3 wt.{\%}, while brine inclusions remained largely unmodified, leading to a change in the partition coefficient D Cu vap / brine from a true value (i.e., before re-equilibration) of 0.4 ± 0.05 to an apparent value of 8.3 ± 4.9. The requirements for substantial diffusional gain of Cu in fluid inclusions are a change in the pH of the surrounding fluid from ⩽1 to more neutral and the presence of S in the pre-existing fluid inclusions. These requirements are also fulfilled in nature: cooling magmatic-hydrothermal fluids experience a change from acidic to more neutral pH due to buffering along the feldspar-mica join, and natural vapor inclusions typically contain significant amounts of sulfur. A reversal experiment performed on natural, quartz-hosted fluid inclusions from the Erongo granite, Namibia, showed that this process can be reversed with the measured D Cu vap / brine value of 11 ± 9.3 being modified to 0.06 ± 0.04. Thus, D Cu vap / brine values {\textgreater}1 measured on natural fluid inclusions in quartz are likely a secondary feature caused by post-entrapment copper diffusion. Realistic D Cu vap / brine values in porphyry Cu environments are between 0.11 and 0.15, and reconstructed vapor/brine mass ratios are in the order of 4–9. This suggests that the main transporting agent of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on copper into the vapor phase are incorrect.},

abstract = {We explore the partial melting behavior of a carbonated silica-deficient eclogite (SLEC1; 5 wt {\%} CO2) from experiments at 3 GPa and compare the compositions of partial melts with those of alkalic and highly alkalic oceanic island basalts (OIBs). The solidus is located at 1050–1075 °C and the liquidus at ∼1415 °C. The sub-solidus assemblage consists of clinopyroxene, garnet, ilmenite, and calcio-dolomitic solid solution and the near solidus melt is carbonatitic ({\textless}2 wt {\%} SiO2, {\textless}1 wt {\%} Al2O3, and {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}1 wt {\%} TiO2). Beginning at 1225 °C, a strongly silica-undersaturated silicate melt (∼34–43 wt {\%} SiO2) with high TiO2 (up to 19 wt {\%}) coexists with carbonate-rich melt ({\textless}5 wt {\%} SiO2). The first appearance of carbonated silicate melt is ∼100 °C cooler than the expected solidus of CO2-free eclogite. In contrast to the continuous transition from carbonate to silicate melts observed experimentally in peridotite + CO2 systems, carbonate and silicate melt coexist over a wide temperature interval for partial melting of SLEC1 carbonated eclogite at 3 GPa. Silicate melts generated from SLEC1, especially at high melt fraction ({\textgreater}20 wt {\%}), may be plausible sources or contributing components to melilitites and melilititic nephelinites from oceanic provinces, as they have strong compositional similarities including their SiO2, FeO*, MgO, CaO, TiO2 and Na2O contents, and CaO/Al2O3 ratios. Carbonated silicate partial melts from eclogite may also contribute to less extreme alkalic OIB, as these lavas have a number of compositional attributes, such as high TiO2 and FeO* and low Al2O3, that have not been observed from partial melting of peridotite ± CO2. In upwelling mantle, formation of carbonatite and silicate melts from eclogite and peridotite source lithologies occurs over a wide range of depths, producing significant opportunities for metasomatic transfer and implantation of melts.},

abstract = {The petrology of base metal sulfides and associated accessory minerals in rocks away from economically significant ore zones such as the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex has previously received only scant attention, yet this information is critical in the evaluation of models for the formation of Bushveld-type platinum-group element (PGE) deposits. Trace sulfide minerals, primarily pyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite are generally less than 100 microns in size, and occur as disseminated interstitial individual grains, as polyphase assemblages, and less commonly as inclusions in pyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine. Pyrite after pyrrhotite is commonly associated with low temperature greenschist alteration haloes around sulfide grains. Pyrrhotite hosted by Cr- and Ti-poor magnetite (Fe3O4) occurs in several samples from the Marginal to Lower Critical Zones below the platiniferous Merensky Reef. These grains occur with calcite that is in textural equilibrium with the igneous silicate minerals, occur with Cl-rich apatite, and are interpreted as resulting from high temperature sulfur loss during degassing of interstitial liquid. A quantitative model demonstrates how many of the first-order features of the Bushveld ore metal distribution could have developed by vapor refining of the crystal pile by chloride–carbonate-rich fluids during which sulfur and sulfide are continuously recycled, with sulfur moving from the interior of the crystal pile to the top during vapor degassing.},

abstract = {Amphibole is one of the most important hydrous minerals of the middle and lower continental crust and plays a key role in the formation of intermediate to silica-rich magmas. This study reports a consistent set of amphibole trace element partition coefficients derived from fractional crystallization experiments at 0.7 GPa in a piston cylinder apparatus. Starting materials were doped with trace elements on the 20–40 ppm level and measured using laser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS. Amphibole is stable from 1010 to 730 °C and systematically changes its composition from pargasite to magnesiohornblende to cummingtonite, while coexisting liquids vary from andesite to dacite and rhyolite. Amphibole–liquid partition coefficients increase systematically with decreasing temperature and increasing SiO2 in the liquid. Potassium displays an inverse behavior and partitioning decreases with decreasing temperature. Rare earth element (REE) partition coefficients, assumed to occupy the M4 site within the amphibole structure, increase continuously up to one order of magnitude. The calculated lattice parameters, ideal cation radius (r0) and Young's modulus (E) remain nearly constant with decreasing temperature. The high-field strength elements Zr and Hf that occupy the M2 site of the amphibole structure reveal a fivefold increase in partition coefficients with decreasing temperature and constant lattice parameters r0 and E. Partition coefficients correlate with edenite, tschermaks and cummingtonite exchange vectors indicating that the maximum partition coefficient (D0) for an ideal cation radius increases with decreasing edenite component, while the latter decreases linearly with temperature. Regressing Amph/LDCa against trace elements results in fair to excellent correlations (r2 0.55–0.99) providing a predictive tool to implement the trace element partition coefficients in numerical geochemical modeling. Our data result in positive correlations between Amph/LDNb/Ta and Amph/LDCa, and Mg{\#}. Spoon-shaped REE patterns and subchondritic Nb/Ta ratios in tonalitic to granodioritic plutonic rocks and andesitic to rhyolitic magmas directly constrained by measured trace element compositions of coexisting liquids are consistent with hornblende gabbro fractionation in the middle to lower crust. The systematic change of the measured trace element composition of fractionating calc-alkaline liquids indicates that hornblende gabbro formation in the middle to lower crust also exerts an important control on some commonly used trace element ratios such as Sr/Y, Sr/Ba or Nb/Zr.},

abstract = {Abstract
The Cenozoic Ambohimirahavavy alkaline complex in the northwest of Madagascar is characterized, in its outer flanks, by a network of discontinuous granitic dykes mineralized in rare-earth elements (REE) and high-field-strength elements (HFSE). These granitic dykes contain alkali amphibole and pyroxene, are strongly ferrian, have a peralkaline affinity [molar (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 {\textgreater} 1], but differ in textures and mineral assemblages. Based on the latter parameters, three varieties of granite could be distinguished: coarse-grained, pegmatitic and eudialyte-bearing granite. Detailed study of the REE- and HFSE-bearing minerals revealed the presence of both magmatic and hydrothermal phases. In coarse-grained granite (GR-I) prevails a magmatic miaskitic assemblage, rich in zircon. In the pegmatitic granite (GR-II), the rare metals are contained in secondary minerals, essentially amoeboid zircon and rare-earth fluorocarbonates, forming pseudomorphs after eudialyte. The eudialyte-bearing granite (GR-III), the richest in REE and HFSE, is characterized by a magmatic agpaitic assemblage, dominated by eudialyte. A skarn develops at the contact of GR-I with limestone. Mineralization in this zone is in the form of pseudomorphs of rare-metal-bearing minerals after aegirine–augite.

Presence of a magmatic miaskitic vs. an agpaitic assemblage in the coarse-grained and eudialyte-bearing granites, respectively, is interpreted to result from crystallization of differently evolved melts that probably originated from a common basaltic parental magma. Origin from the melting of a metasomatized lower crust cannot be excluded. In the eudialyte-bearing granite, very high contents of Na and volatiles maintained the rare metals in the melt to the very last stages of crystallization, whereas in the coarse-grained granite, Na and volatiles were probably lost to an exsolving fluid, causing the precipitation of a miaskitic assemblage. Subsolidus remobilization of REE and HFSE took place via an alkali-, silica- and F-rich orthomagmatic fluid exsolved from the crystallizing peralkaline granitic melt.},

abstract = {The major element compositions of the various rocks that belong to the basalt clan are examined, and the basalt clan is defined as consisting of those volcanic rocks that contain between 44.0{\%} and 53.5{\%} silica. After examining both the diverse tectonic environments in which the basaltic rocks are found, and also the various petrographic suites to which they belong, or appear to belong, new chemical criteria were devised to divide them into the following groups: (1) low-potash basalt, (2) high-alumina basalt, (3) continental-flood basalt, (4) komatiitic basalt, (5) sodic basalt, (6) hawaiite, (7) phonolitic basalt, (8) potassic basalt, (9) trachybasalt, (10) leucitite, (11) sodic transitional basalt, and (12) potassic transitional basalt. The lunar mare-basalts are regarded as being transitional in their chemical character between the low-potash, ocean-floor basalts and the komatiitic basalts. While it was relatively easy to discover petrogenetic models that were able to account for the origin and evolution of the common sub-alkalic basalts, and even the sodic basalts, a variety of possible petrogenetic models had to be explored in order to account for the origin and evolution of the different basaltic rocks of the potash- and high-potash series.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in the origin of silicic magmas at spreading centres away from any possible influence of continental crust. Here we present major and trace element data for 29 glasses (and 55 whole-rocks) sampled from a 40 km segment of the South East Rift in the Manus Basin that span the full compositional continuum from basalt to rhyolite (50–75 wt {\%} SiO2). The glass data are accompanied by Sr–Nd–Pb, O and U–Th–Ra isotope data for selected samples. These overlap the ranges for published data from this part of the Manus Basin. Limited increases in Cl/K ratios with increasing SiO2, La–SiO2 and Yb–SiO2 relationships, and the oxygen isotope data rule out models in which the more silicic lavas result from partial melting of altered oceanic crust or altered oceanic gabbros. Rather, the data form a coherent array that is suggestive of closed-system fractional crystallization and this is well simulated by MELTS models run at 0{\textperiodcentered}2 GPa and QFM (quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer) with 1 wt {\%} H2O, using a parental magma chosen from the basaltic glasses. Although some assimilation of altered oceanic crust or gabbro cannot be completely ruled out, there is no evidence that this plays an important role in the origin of the silicic lavas. The U-series disequilibria are dominated by 238U and 226Ra excesses that limit the timescale of differentiation to less than a few millennia. Overall, the data point to rapid evolution in relatively small magma lenses located near the base of thick oceanic crust; we speculate that this was coupled with relatively low rates of basaltic recharge. A similar model may be applicable to the generation of silicic magmas elsewhere in the ocean basins.},

abstract = {Saw dust obtained from the cutting of EET A79001, a meteorite with a presumed Martian origin, has been analyzed for its carbon content and stable isotopic composition in order to assess the sample's potential value for studies aimed at elucidating Martian surface processes. These fines, which are available in plentiful supply, are a useful source of material and are important since they are a representative whole-rock sample of this complex meteorite. In addition, the fines give an indication of contamination sources which may affect not only the collected sawings but also the sawn surface of the meteorite. A number of contaminants were identified in the fines (e.g. organic materials, Teflon, diamond, and carbon associated with metal). It is considered that the levels of carbon contamination measured represent a worst possible case and hence provide a valuable reference with which to compare other analyses of this sample, or indeed, other Martian meteorites. Evidence was found for an indigenous carbonate component similar to that observed previously in other fractions of the meteorite. However, based on the results presented herein it is not possible to assert that isotopically distinct carbonate minerals of different origins are present in the meteorite. The levels of trapped Martian atmospheric CO2 calculated for the fines are unexpectedly high (∼1 ppm carbon), but this could be influenced by the presence of other, as yet unknown, carbonaceous materials.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic Monteregian alkaline province of southern Quebec includes mafic aln{\"{o}}ite, monchiquite, basanite, camptonite, and alkali basalt dykes. Most carry phenocrysts of clinopyroxene that generally zone towards Ti–AlIV–Fe–Mn-rich and Mg–AlVI–Cr-poor rims. The zoning can best be explained through polybaric crystallization and differentiation during ascent from the upper mantle. In intermediate and leucocratic dykes, clinopyroxene AlIV–Ti contents decrease with the Mg/(Mg + $\Sigma$Fe) ratio, probably reflecting concurrent fractionation of a Ti-rich phase. Pyroxene phenocrysts in Monteregian mafic dykes commonly have green clinopyroxene cores that are richer in Na and Fe and poorer in Mg and Cr than the enclosing titansalite phenocrysts. Some cores are euhedral and sector zoned, implying crystallization from a melt more evolved than their present hosts. The high AlVI contents of these cores imply high pressures of crystallization. The abundance of crustal xenoliths and evolved pyroxene cores indicates that the host magmas hybridized with felsic melts, cumulates, or metasomatites within the crust or an anomalously Fe–Na-rich upper mantle. This implies that the host dykes are not primary magmas but hybrids. Consequently, dyke chemistry cannot simply be inverted to determine the composition and mineralogy of the mantle source.},

abstract = {A graben structure has been identified at the western area of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera wall, here referred as the Los Azulejos Graben. This graben is 1 km wide and is bounded by two major normal faults trending NE-SW, the Los Azulejos Fault and the Ucanca Fault. The graben was active for at least 0.5 Ma, from the end of the Ucanca Fm to the end of the Guajara Fm, and before the collapse of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice that formed the western caldera. A right-lateral transtension regime operated in the graben as suggested by small fault orientations and kinematics. The prolongation of the NE rift zone of Tenerife to the Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice is the most likely volcano-tectonic scenario for the graben. In this context, inflation of phonolitic shallow magma chambers may have produced reverse faults and reactivation of normal faults. An intense and widespread hydrothermal alteration, here called Azulejos-type, occurred mainly before the graben formation, while a fault-related hydrothermal alteration occurred during and after the graben. Diffuse carbon dioxide and hydrogen degassing in and around the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera show relatively enriched values along a NE-SW trend suggesting that faults in the Los Azulejos Graben act as a pathway for deep-seated gases to the surface. Diffuse degassing and hydrothermalism indicate that the graben area has been a zone of intense fluid circulation during the evolution of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The anorogenic Damaraland intrusive complexes in Namibia belong to the bimodal Paran-Etendeka Large Igneous Province and comprise mafic, silicic and alkaline plutonic, and volcanic rocks that were emplaced into the Neoproterozoic Damara orogenic belt at 124 to 137 Ma. The magmatism was related to the Tristan mantle plume and continental rifting that led to separation of South America from Africa. Silicic plutonic rocks are found in the Gross Spitzkoppe, Klein Spitzkoppe, Erongo, Brandberg, Messum, Cape Cross, and Paresis complexes. The Gross Spitzkoppe and Klein Spitzkoppe stocks consist of texturally distinct types of topaz-bearing biotite (siderophyllite-annite) granites with columbite, zircon, magnetite, and monazite as typical heavy accessory minerals. A bimodal magmatic association is indicated by synplutonic mafic dikes and magmatic mafic inclusions. The stocks have rims of layered aplite-pegmatite stockscheiders against the country rocks. Miarolitic cavities and pegmatite-lined druses with gem-quality topaz and beryl indicate vapor saturation, and hydrothermal activity has locally produced wolframite-bearing greisen. The Spitzkoppe granites are highly evolved, marginally peraluminous (A/CNK 0.95 to 1.09) and characterized by high SiO2 (74.4 to 78.6 wt.{\%}), Na2O + K2O (7.6 to 8.8 wt.{\%}, with K2O prevailing over Na2O), F, Rb, and Ga, as well as low MgO, Ba, and Sr. The small but clear differences in REE patterns [(La/Yb)(N) in Gross Spitzkoppe 2.5 to 7.7 with mean at 4.4, in Klein Spitzkoppe 0.6 to 1.6 with mean at 0.9, more pronounced negative (Eu/Eu*)N anomaly in Klein Spitzkoppe] show that the granites of the Klein Spitzkoppe stock are slightly more evolved than those of the Gross Spitzkoppe stock. Overall, the granites exhibit A-type and within plate characteristics. Available 0, Nd and Sr isotope data suggest that the silicic rocks of the anorogenic Damaraland complexes have mixed sources, with plume-related mantle magmas and two types of lower crustal sources (orogenic Damara basement and pre-Damara gneisses) as end members. The mantle component prevails in the metaluminous and peralkaline granites of the Brandberg complex, whereas Damara crustal rocks were dominant in the source of the cordierite-bearing peraluminous granodiorites and tourmaline-bearing granites of the Erongo complex. Pre-Damara gneisses are the main source component in the Paresis rhyolites. The Spitzkoppe and Cape Cross granites have both major mantle and crustal (Damara) sources. Although it is not possible to identify a unique petrogenctic process by which the Damaraland complexes formed, it is clear that the magmas formed in an extensional environment and that both mantle and crustal sources were involved in production of these magmas.

abstract = {The Ethiopian Rift Valley hosts the longest record of human co-existence with volcanoes on Earth, however, current understanding of the magnitude and timing of large explosive eruptions in this region is poor. Detailed records of volcanism are essential for interpreting the palaeoenvironments occupied by our hominin ancestors; and also for evaluating the volcanic hazards posed to the 10 million people currently living within this active rift zone. Here we use new geochronological evidence to suggest that a 200km-long segment of rift experienced a major pulse of explosive volcanic activity between 320 and 170 ka. During this period, at least four distinct volcanic centres underwent large-volume (410km3) caldera-forming eruptions, and eruptive fluxes were elevated five times above the average eruption rate for the past 700ka. We propose that such pulses of episodic silicic volcanism would have drastically remodelled landscapes and ecosystems occupied by early hominin populations.},

abstract = {This paper is a review of the research that led to an indepth understanding of flow and transport processes under strong heat stimulation in fractured, porous rock. It first describes the anticipated multiple processes that come into play in a partially saturated, fractured porous volcanic tuff geological formation when it is subject to a heat source such as that originating from the decay of radionuclides. The rationale is then given for numerical modeling being a key element in the study of multiple processes that are coupled. The paper outlines how the conceptualization and the numerical modeling of the problem evolved, progressing from the simplified to the more realistic. Examples of numerical models are presented so as to illustrate the advancement and maturation of the research over the last 2 decades. The most recent model applied to in situ field thermal tests is characterized by (1) incorporation of a full set of thermal-hydrological processes into a numerical simulator, (2) realistic representation of the field test geometry in three dimensions, and (3) use of site-specific characterization data for model inputs. Model predictions were carried out prior to initiation of data collection, and the model results were compared to diverse sets of measurements. The approach of close integration between modeling and field measurements has yielded a better understanding of how coupled thermal hydrological processes produce redistribution of moisture within the rock, which affects local permeability values and subsequently the flow of liquid and gases. The fluid flow, in turn, will change the temperature field. We end with a note on future research opportunities, specifically those incorporating chemical, mechanical, and microbiological factors into the study of thermal and hydrological processes.},

abstract = {This paper reports the first in situ magnetic hysteresis measurements of pseudo-single-domain (PSD) magnetite under high pressure up to 1 GPa. The magnetic hysteresis measurements of stoichiometric PSD magnetite samples under hydrostatic pressure were carried out using a piston-cylinder high-pressure cell, and the pressure dependence of the hysteresis parameters of PSD magnetite was calculated from the hysteresis curves. It was found that coercivity (Bc) increases with increasing pressure as a quadratic function up to 1 GPa by 90{\%}, which is different from the pressure dependences of Bc of multidomain and singledomain magnetites. Coercivity of remanence also increases as a quadratic function, and saturation remanence (Mrs) increases with pressure up to 0.5 GPa by 20{\%} until reaching saturation. In contrast, saturation magnetization is constant up to 1 GPa. The approximate demagnetizing factor calculated from the ratio Bc/Mrs increases with increasing pressure, suggesting that the number of lamellar domains increases with increasing pressure. The number of lamellar domains and domain wall width are theoretically estimated to increase under high pressure due to the changes in magnetostriction, elastic, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants, and these changes in magnetic domain structure should relate to the changes in the magnetic properties of PSD magnetite.},

abstract = {The phase relationships of three peralkaline rhyolites from the Kenya Rift have been established at 150 and 50 MPa, at oxygen fugacities of NNO − 1{\textperiodcentered}6 and NNO + 3{\textperiodcentered}6 (log fO2 relative to the Ni–NiO solid buffer), between 800 and 660°C and for melt H2O contents ranging between saturation and nominally anhydrous. The stability fields of fayalite, sodic amphiboles, chevkinite and fluorite in natural hydrous silicic magmas are established. Additional phases include quartz, alkali feldspar, ferrohedenbergite, biotite, aegirine, titanite, montdorite and oxides. Ferrohedenbergite crystallization is restricted to the least peralkaline rock, together with fayalite; it is replaced at low melt water contents by ferrorichterite. Riebeckite–arfvedsonite appears only in the more peralkaline rocks, at temperatures below 750°C (dry) and below 670°C at H2O saturation. Under oxidizing conditions, it breaks down to aegirine. In the more peralkaline rocks, biotite is restricted to temperatures below 700°C and conditions close to H2O saturation. At 50 MPa, the tectosilicate liquidus temperatures are raised by 50–60°C, and that of amphibole by 30°C. Riebeckite–arfvedsonite stability extends down nearly to atmospheric pressure, as a result of its F-rich character. The solidi of all three rocks are depressed by 40–100°C compared with the solidus of the metaluminous granite system, as a result of the abundance of F and Cl. Low fO2 lowers solidus temperatures by at least 30°C. Comparison with studies of metaluminous and peraluminous felsic magmas shows that plagioclase crystallization is suppressed as soon as the melt becomes peralkaline, whatever its CaO or volatile contents. In contrast, at 100 MPa and H2O saturation, the liquidus temperatures of quartz and alkali feldspar are not significantly affected by changes in rock peralkalinity, showing that the incorporation of water in peralkaline melts diminishes the depression of liquidus temperatures in dry peralkaline silicic melts compared with dry metaluminous or peraluminous varieties. At 150 MPa, pre-eruptive melt H2O contents range from 4 wt {\%} in the least peralkaline rock to nearly 6 wt {\%} in the two more peralkaline compositions, in broad agreement with previous melt inclusion data. The experimental results imply magmatic fO2 at or below the fayalite–quartz–magnetite solid buffer, temperatures between 740 and 660°C, and melt evolution under near H2O saturation conditions.},

abstract = {The origin of mafic and ultramafic sills exhibiting different whole-rock compositional profiles (e.g. I-, C-, D-, M- and S-shaped profiles) remains controversial. We have addressed this issue by revisiting three ∼100 m thick Siberian dolerite sills (Vavukansky, Kuz'movsky and Vilyuysky) that display remarkable internal differentiation. The Vavukansky sill has an M-shaped profile with prominent basal and top reversals showing inward increases in whole-rock MgO, Mg-number [100Mg/(Mg + Fe)] and normative An content [100An/(An + Ab)], followed by the Layered and Upper Border Series with inward decreases in these indices. The Kuz'movsky and Vilyuysky sills both show S-shaped profiles similar to the Vavukansky sill, but lack a top reversal. These whole-rock M- and S-shaped profiles are accompanied by similar profiles in mineral compositions. Plagioclase and, to a lesser extent, olivine show systematic inward increases in An content and Mg-number, respectively, across basal and top reversals. These compositional trends are followed by inward decreases in these ratios in the interiors of the Vavukansky and Kuz'movsky sills. Currently accepted models attribute whole-rock M- and S-shaped compositional profiles to crystal settling, compositional convection or compaction operating in closed systems. Our observations challenge these traditional interpretations because variations in mineral compositions observed in marginal reversals cannot result from closed-system fractionation. We suggest instead that initially the sills evolved as open systems that were slowly inflated by magmas that became gradually more primitive with time. The inflation was accompanied by in situ crystallization that preserved the preceding fractionation history of the injected magmas by forming basal and top reversals with minerals becoming more primitive inwards. This process culminated with rapid inflation of the sills to their current size owing to a major influx of primitive magma. Subsequently, magma flow through the sills ceased and they evolved as closed systems by fractional crystallization. This resulted in the Layered and Upper Border Series with minerals becoming more evolved inwards. This model can be extended to explain other compositional profiles and petrological features in mafic and ultramafic sills.},

abstract = {Following its subduction, oceanic crust either contributes to the source of island-arc volcanic rocks or it is recycled into the mantle. Most, but not all authors believe that recycled crust is incorporated into the plume source of oceanic basalts. The hafnium (Hf) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic compositions of basalts from oceanic islands and mid-ocean ridges exhibit a linear relationship—the mantle array—which is thought to result from mixing between material from the depleted mantle and an enriched recycled component. Here, we model the Hf–Nd isotopic composition of oceanic basalts as a mixture of recycled oceanic crust and depleted mantle and find that recycling of basalt alone is not sufficient to reproduce the mantle array. We conclude that oceanic sediments, which have a relatively high 176Hf/177Hf ratio, must also be recycled. Combining oceanic sediments with recycled oceanic basalts and subsequent mixing with depleted mantle peridotite produces Hf and Nd isotopic compositions that coincide with the mantle array. The composition of bulk continental crust requires the existence of a complementary low 176Hf/177Hf reservoir, which we suggest is zircon-rich sediment.},

abstract = {The intraplate volcanic suite of the Cha{\^{i}}ne des Puys (French Massif Central) shows a complete petrologic range, from alkali basalts to trachytes. The significant variations of trace elements and radiogenic isotopes along the series strongly support the occurrence of crustal assimilation associated with fractional crystallization (AFC). The least contaminated basalts are clearly related to a HIMU-type reservoir (206Pb/204Pb {\textgreater} 19.6; 87Sr/86Sr {\textless} 0.7037; $\epsilon$Nd {\textgreater} + 4). The behavior of radiogenic isotopes suggests that the most likely crustal contaminants are meta-sediments located in the lower crust. The Li isotopic compositions of the lavas range from high $\delta$7Li ({\textgreater} + 7‰) in basalts to lighter values in more evolved lavas (down to $\delta$7Li ≈ 0‰). The mantle component, expressed in the least evolved lavas, has a heavy Li isotopic signature, in good agreement with previous $\delta$7Li measurements of OIB lavas with HIMU affinities. The evolution of Li isotopic compositions throughout the volcanic series is in agreement with the AFC model suggested by the Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic systems. Although the behavior of Li isotopes during assimilation processes is currently poorly constrained, our calculations suggest that at least a portion of the lower crust beneath the Cha{\^{i}}ne des Puys is characterized by a light Li isotopic composition ($\delta$7Li {\textless} − 5‰).},

abstract = {Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic data on alkaline volcanic rocks and carbonatites from the Kaiserstuhl Miocene alkaline volcano in the southern part of the Rhinegraben rift valley are presented. Isotopically, three distinct groups of volcanic rocks can be distinguished which are correlated to different magmatic series: 1. (1) Unfractionated primary mantle melts (olivine nephelinites, olivine melilitites) and nepheline basanites:87Sr86Sr=0.7032-0.7040; $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}Nd=4.18-5.03;206Pb204Pb=18.95-18.98). Geochemically, these rocks correspond to a Na-dominated magmatic series. 2. (2) Fractionated alkaline rocks (tephrites, phonolites:87Sr86Sr=0.7039-0.7051; $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}Nd=2.07-3.96;206Pb204Pb=19.10-19.42), corresponding to a K-dominated magmatic series. 3. (3) A group with carbonatites, bergalites, hauynophyres (87Sr86Sr=0.7036-0.7040; $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}Nd=2.81-4.04;206Pb204Pb=19.24-19.66). These results are discussed in terms of derivation from different mantle sources and interaction of asthenospheric melts with subcontinental lithospheric mantle during their ascent. Contamination with crustal material is important in the tephritic magma series, also in some phonolites. The isotopic data point to a metasomatic overprinting of the upper mantle below the Kaiserstuhl. This metasomatism is thought to be directly connected with the updomed mantle structure in this region. For the carbonatitic rocks a genetic linkage to olivine nephelinites is most likely. This implies an asthenospheric origin of the carbonatitic melts. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

@article{Wade2012,
abstract = {In order to place better constraints on the conditions of core formation on Earth and other planetary bodies we have performed experiments to determine the partitioning of Mo and W between liquid Fe-rich metal and liquid silicate at pressures of 1.5-24GPa and temperatures of 1803-2723K. Experiments performed in MgO capsules at 1.5GPa/1923K indicate that Mo is in the +4 oxidation state in the silicate at oxygen fugacities {\textgreater}2log units below the IW (Fe-FeO) buffer. In contrast W 
                        6+ is the dominant tungsten oxidation state in the silicate at 1.5GPa/1923K and 1.8-3.3log units below the IW buffer. When our 15 data for pressures between 6 and 24GPa are combined with those of Cottrell et al. (2009) we find evidence neither for a change in oxidation state of W above 6GPa nor for a change in pressure dependence of partitioning in the experimental fO 
                        2 range.Metal-silicate partitioning of both Mo and W shows strong dependence on silicate melt composition with both elements becoming more siderophile as the melt becomes more SiO 
                        2-rich. Although the trends in the partitioning data can be related to silicate melt composition in terms of the ratio of nonbridging oxygens to tetrahedral cations NBOT we find that use of a regular solution model for the silicate melt results in a significantly better fit to the data.We combined our results with those in the literature to obtain partitioning equations applicable to the Earth. In terms of weight partitioning we define . Diwt and . (KDi)wt as follows:. The experimental data, when corrected for compositional effects, yield the following expressions for a pyrolite mantle:. The value in brackets corresponds to 1 standard error of the fit. These expressions were combined with the continuous accretion model of . Wade and Wood (2005) to investigate the constraints which they place on the accretionary process. We find, however, that, for accretionary paths consistent with the silicate Earth contents of Ni, Co, V, Cr and Nb, W should partition twice as strongly into the core as Mo. This is in stark contrast to the estimated core-mantle partition coefficients of {\~{}}40 for W and 90-140 for Mo. Neither changes to the accretionary path nor the assumption of partial disequilibrium can readily alter this result. The answer appears to reside with the identity of one of the light elements in the core.We investigated the effect of S on our accretionary model by adding 2{\%} of this element (consistent with cosmochemical estimates) to the core. If S is added at constant S/Fe ratio throughout accretion the net effect is negligible. If, however, S is added exclusively during the last 10-20{\%} of accretion D 
                        Mo and D 
                        W become consistent with the silicate Earth contents of these elements. Only small additional adjustments to the model are required to accommodate changes in partitioning of Ni, Co, V, Cr and Nb. We conclude that the Mo and W contents of the silicate Earth indicate that S (and other moderately volatile elements) was added to the Earth during core formation but only during the last {\~{}}20{\%} of accretion. This conclusion is the same as that reached by Sch??nb??chler et al. (2010) from the Ag isotopic composition of silicate Earth. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ancochea1999,
abstract = {The volcano-stratigraphic and geochronologic data presented in this work show that the Tenerife central zone has been occupied during the last 3 Ma by shield or central composite volcanoes which reached more than 3000 m in height. The last volcanic system, the presently active Teide-Pico Viejo Complex began to form approximately 150 ka ago. The first Ca{\~{n}}adas Edifice (CE) volcanic activity took place between about 3.5 Ma and 2.7 Ma. The CE-I is formed mainly by basalts, trachybasalts and trachytes. The remains of this phase outcrop in the Ca{\~{n}}adas Wall (CW) sectors of La Angostura (3.5–3.0 Ma and 3.0–2.7 Ma), Boca de Tauce (3.0 Ma), and in the bottom of some external radial ravines (3.5 Ma). The position of its main emission center was located in the central part of the CC. The volcano could have reached 3000 m in height. This edifice underwent a partial destruction by failure and flank collapse, forming debris-avalanches during the 2.6–2.3 Ma period. The debris-avalanche deposits can be seen in the most distal zones in the N flank of the CE-I (Tigaiga Breccia). A new volcanic phase, whose deposits overlie the remains of CE-I and the former debris-avalanche deposits, constituted a new volcanic edifice, the CE-II. The dyke directions analysis and the morphological reconstruction suggest that the CE-II center was situated somewhat westward of the CE-I, reaching some 3200 m in height. The CE-II formations are well exposed on the CW, especially at the El Cedro (2.3–2.00 Ma) sector. They are also frequent in the S flank of the edifice (2.25–1.89 Ma) in Tejina (2.5–1.87 Ma) as well as in the Tigaiga massif to the N (2.23 Ma). During the last periods of activity of CE-II, important explosive eruptions took place forming ignimbrites, pyroclastic flows, and fall deposits of trachytic composition. Their ages vary between 1.5 and 1.6 Ma (Adeje ignimbrites, to the W). In the CW, the Upper Ucanca phonolitic Unit (1.4 Ma) could be the last main episode of the CE-II. Afterwards, the Ca{\~{n}}adas III phase began. It is well represented in the CW sectors of Tigaiga (1.1 Ma–0.27 Ma), Las Pilas (1.03 Ma–0.78 Ma), Diego Hern{\'{a}}ndez (0.54 Ma–0.17 Ma) and Guajara (1.1 Ma–0.7 Ma). The materials of this edifice are also found in the SE flank. These materials are trachybasaltic lava-flows and abundant phonolitic lava and pyroclastic flows (0.6 Ma–0.5 Ma) associated with abundant plinian falls. The CE-III was essentially built between 0.9 and 0.2 Ma, a period when the volcanic activity was also intense in the `Dorsal Edifice' situated in the easterly wing of Tenerife. The so called `valleys' of La Orotava and G{\"{u}}imar, transversals to the ridge axis, also formed during this period. In the central part of Tenerife, the CE-III completed its evolution with an explosive deposit resting on the top of the CE, for which ages from 0.173 to 0.13 Ma have been obtained. The CC age must be younger due to the fact that the present caldera scarp cuts these deposits. On the controversial origin of the CC (central vertical collapse vs. repeated flank failure and lateral collapse of mature volcanic edifices), the data discussed in this paper favor the second hypothesis. Clearly several debris-avalanche type events exist in the history of the volcano but most of the deposits are now under the sea. The caldera wall should represent the proximal scarps of the large slides whose intermediate scarps are covered by the more recent Teide-Pico Viejo volcanoes.},

abstract = {Melting phase relations of a fertile lherzolite KLB-1 have been studied in the pressure range from 1 atm to 14 GPa (140 kbar). Olivine is the liquidus phase at all pressures studied. The second mineral to crystallize changes with increasing pressure; chromian spinel (1 atm), Ca-poor orthopyroxene (up to 3 GPa), pigeonitic clinopyroxene (up to 7 GPa), pyrope-rich garnet (above 7 GPa). The melting temperature interval of the peridotite is more than 600°C wide at 1 atm but narrows to about 150°C at 14 GPa. The partial melts along the peridotite solidus become increasingly more MgO-rich as pressure increases throughout the pressure range studied. At 5–7 GPa, the partial melts formed within 50°C of the solidus contain more than 30 wt {\%} MgO and are very similar to Al-undepleted-type peridotitic komatiite which is common in Archean volcanic terrains. Due to the increase of enstatite component in clinopyroxene solid solution at high pressure and temperature, the orthopyroxene liquidus field narrows as pressure increases and disappears at 3.5 GPa. Harzburgites which are common in the basal peridotite in ophiolite suites may have been produced as residues by partial melting at relatively shallower depths ({\textless} 100 km). Lherzolites showing protogranular textures might have been produced as single-pyroxene peridotite residue by partial melting at relatively greater depths ({\textgreater} 100 km). A diapiric model is consistent with the genesis of komatiite magma by partial melting of mantle peridotite at 150–200 km depth. Based on the following observations, (1) convergence of the liquidus and solidus of the peridotite at pressures {\textgreater} 14 GPa, (2) the near solidus partial melt composition very close to the bulk rock at 14 GPa, and (3) change in liquidus mineral from olivine to majorite garnet at pressures between 16 and 20 GPa in preliminary experiments, it is proposed that the upper mantle peridotite was generated originally as a magma (or magmas) by partial melting of the primitive earth at 400–500 km depth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. The halogen-bearing minerals tourmaline, amphibole, and biotite formed during magmatic–hydrothermal processes associated with the late-stage cooling of the Spirit Lake granitoid pluton (Mt. St. Helens, WA) and with the younger sulphide-mineralised rocks of the Margaret Cu–Mo porphyry deposit located entirely within the pluton. Major- and trace-element discrimination suggests that one tourmaline population crystallised from fractionated late-stage melt pockets in granodiorite–monzogranitic dykes of the pluton. These coarse, euhedral, oscillatory, and complexly sector-zoned uvite tourmalines span a limited range in Mg/(Mg + Fe) [Mg{\#}] space (0.4–0.7 apfu) and show the highest Ti, Ca, F, Nb, and Ta contents, and low X-site vacancies ( {\textless} 0.1 apfu), suggesting slow, ordered crystallisation. Conversely, smaller, microcrystalline, pluton-related vein tourmalines show higher X-site vacancies ( {\textgreater} 0.6 apfu), lower Ca and F contents, and the highest Li, As, and HREE contents ( {\textgreater} 80 ppm Li,  {\textgreater} 1200 ppm As). This population appears to record direct, rapid crystallisation from magmatic ± meteoric fluid(s) bearing the signature of the breakdown of primary feldspars and pyroxenes, with fluid exsolution from fractionated melt patches likely triggered by the formation of the previous generation of tourmaline. Mineralised porphyry deposit tourmaline compositions from the stockwork span a much larger range in Mg{\#} space (0.05–0.9 apfu) and are almost entirely Ca-free. X-sites of these schorl tourmalines are dominated by Na or vacancies, and the Y-sites are strongly Fe enriched. The highest Mn and Zn concentrations ( {\textgreater} 4000 and  {\textgreater} 1000 ppm, respectively) potentially reflect the composition of mineralising fluids during ore deposition. A number of boron isotopic analyses yield predominantly heavy boron, but $\delta$ 11 B values range from −5.2 to 6.2 ‰ and average 1.4 ‰. Whilst most plutonic tourmalines conform to reported a- and c-sector element partitioning models, those from the mineralised porphyry show large and variable sector fractionation differences, suggesting that external controls may also be important. Wider evidence for late-stage pervasive metasomatism by halogen-bearing exsolved fluid(s) is provided by the high Mg{\#} ( {\textgreater} 70) secondary amphiboles and biotites from within the Spirit Lake pluton, where the amphiboles are clear replacement products of primary pyroxenes. Fluid halogen fugacity ratios calculated from the biotite compositions overlap with other global mineralised porphyry systems, despite not being immediately associated with sulphide ores. The evidence suggests complex fluid processes and the coincidental development of the mineralised porphyry system within the pluton. Heat, fluids, and metals were therefore likely supplied by a later phase of magmatism, unrelated to the consolidation of the main Spirit Lake granitoid. These new constraints on magmatic–hydrothermal fluid signatures have wider applicability to potentially tracing proximal barren and mineralised processes, and for distinguishing between formation mechanisms for primary and secondary halogen-bearing minerals.},

abstract = {The Franklin sills and dykes on Victoria Island in the Canadian Arctic represent the sub-volcanic plumbing system to the Natkusiak flood basalts, which are associated with the late Neoproterozoic (c. 723–716 Ma) break-up of Rodinia. The Lower Pyramid Sill (LPS) is the distal end of a sill complex that may be rooted in the Uhuk Massif, a major fault-guided magmatic feeder system. The LPS is unusual for a thin (c. 21 m), shallow, tholeiitic intrusion because it displays well-developed cumulate layering similar to that seen in large layered intrusions. The LPS has an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5{\%}) Lower Chilled Margin (LCM), a ({\textless}1 m thick) dendritic, olivine-phyric Lower Border Zone (LBZ), a (c. 7 m thick) olivine-dominated (up to c. 55{\%}) melagabbro–feldspathic-peridotite zone (OZ), a thin (c. 1 m) clinopyroxene-rich cumulate gabbro (CPZ) containing sector-zoned euhedral clinopyroxene, a (c. 10 m thick) doleritic gabbro zone (DZ), a ({\textless}1 m thick) aphyric, dendritic Upper Border Zone (UBZ) and an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5{\%}) Upper Chilled Margin (UCM). Distinct compositional groups recognized in olivines from the OZ can be associated with specific crystal morphologies, some showing significant reverse zoning. Melt compositions were calculated through application of the olivine–melt Fe = Mg exchange coefficient. The calculations suggest that phenocrystic and primocrystic olivine (Fo88–82) in the LCM–LBZ and lower OZ formed from melts with c. 13–10 wt {\%} MgO. Modeling implies that reversely zoned olivine primocrysts and chadacrysts have rims in equilibrium with melts of c. 10–8 wt {\%} MgO that were saturated only in olivine (+ minor chromite), whereas some olivine cores formed from melts as evolved as c. 6–5 wt {\%} MgO that would have coexisted with a gabbroic assemblage. The presence of multiple olivine populations in the OZ (some reverse zoned) indicates that the LPS did not crystallize from a single pulse of melt that evolved by closed-system fractional crystallization. We propose that the reverse zoning pattern records incorporation of evolved crystals, most derived from the mushy gabbroic host, when an olivine-charged replenishment under- or intraplated the partly crystallized basaltic magma, now preserved as the DZ. The intervening CPZ may also owe its origin to the emplacement of the olivine slurry, possibly as a result of pore-scale melt mixing at this interface. The DZ shows inward differentiation trends that can be explained by in situ differentiation. The data imply that late emplacement of olivine-rich crystal slurries and in situ differentiation both played a role in the development of the layered LPS.},

@article{Klugel1999,
abstract = {The compositionally zoned San Juan eruption on La Palma emanated from three eruptive centers located along a north-south-trending rift zone in the south of the island. Seismic precursors began weakly in 1936 and became strong in March 1949, with their foci progressing from the north of the rift zone towards its south. This suggests that magma ascended beneath the old Taburiente shield volcano and moved southward along the rift. The eruption began on June 24, 1949, with phreatomagmatic activity at Duraznero crater on the ridgetop (ca. 1880 m above sea level), where five vents erupted tephritic lava along a 400-m-long fissure. On June 8, the Duraznero vents shut down abruptly, and the activity shifted to an off-rift fissure at Llano del Banco, located at ca. 550 m lower elevation and 3 km to the northwest. This eruptive center issued initially tephritic aa and later basanitic pahoehoe lava at high rates, producing a lava flow that entered the sea. Two days after basanite began to erupt at Llano del Banco, Hoyo Negro crater (ca. 1880 m asl), located 700 m north of Duraznero along the rift, opened on July 12 and produced ash and bombs of basanitic to phonotephritic composition in violent phreatomagmatic explosions (White and Schmincke, 1999). Llano del Banco and Hoyo Negro were simultaneously active for 11 days and showed a co-variance of their eruption rates indicating a shallow hydraulic connection. On July 30, after 3 days of quiescence at all vents, Duraznero and Hoyo Negro became active again during a final eruptive phase. Duraznero issued basanitic lava at high rates for 12 h and produced a lava flow that descended towards the east coast. The lava contains ca. 1 vol.{\%} crustal and mantle xenoliths consisting of 40{\%} tholeiitic gabbros from the oceanic crust, 35{\%} alkaline gabbros, and 20{\%} ultramafic cumulates. The occurrence of xenoliths almost exclusively in the final lava is consistent with their origin by wall-rock collapse at depth near the end of the eruption. The volcanic evolution of the 1949 eruption is typical of La Palma eruptions generally. Considerable shallow magma migration prior to and during eruption is manifested by strong seismicity, intense faulting, and the almost unpredictable opening of specific vents which can be spaced three or more km apart.

abstract = {The Poris Member (0.28 Ma) of the Diego Hern{\'{a}}ndez Formation (Tenerife, Canary Islands) is a widespread succession of plinian fall, surge and non-welded ignimbrite deposits. It was erupted from the northeastern sector of the multicyclic Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera, the summit caldera complex of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Edifice. We present new stratigraphic data which allow the evolution of the eruption to be divided into six main stages: (1) an initial surge-producing phreatomagmatic phase. (2) Generation of a buoyant plinian column culminating in vent-wall collapse and temporary vent blockage. (3) A resumption of phreatomagmatic activity, producing accretionary lapilli-bearing ash surges and a phreatomagmatic ignimbrite. (4) Sustained column collapse, resulting in the progressive aggradation of a complex, compositionally layered ignimbrite sequence. (5) A late plinian phase marked by sharp chemical zonation. (6) Final vent destruction and the generation of multiple surges and pyroclastic flows. Volume calculations indicate a total erupted volume in the order of 13–14 km3 (3–4 km3 dense rock equivalent), which together with facies and lithic analysis implies that a small-scale caldera collapse occurred, contributing to the incremental enlargement of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera. The geochemistry and mingling inter-relationships of four magmatic endmembers, ranging from alkaline mafic to evolved phonolitic liquids, indicate that two magma chambers fed stages 4 and 5 of the eruption sequence. The eruption was triggered when mafic magma intruded the two-chamber system.},

abstract = {An elemental and radiogenic isotope study of Cretaceous island arc rocks on Tobago, West Indies, reveals the magmatic processes taking place at the eastern edge of the Pacific-derived Caribbean Plate during development of the Greater Antilles Arc. The ∼110–103 Ma Volcano-Plutonic Suite comprises the ultramafic–intermediate Tobago Pluton and genetically related Tobago Volcanic Group. The volcanic rocks (breccias, tuffs, and mafic–intermediate lavas) have undergone shallow-level fractional crystallization involving plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine, and Fe–Ti oxides, but also preserve trace element evidence for ‘cryptic' amphibole fractionation. The suite is inferred to have formed from a spinel lherzolite mantle wedge source fluxed largely by slab- and recycled volcanogenic sediment-derived fluids. A tonalitic mega-dyke intruding the pluton resembles high-silica adakites, and geochemical constraints indicate a likely origin by partial melting of the arc crust. A mafic dyke swarm (∼103–91 Ma) is partly coeval with the volcanic rocks, but some, perhaps the youngest dykes, are derived from isotopically distinct arc mantle sources compared with the volcanic rocks. Rare Nb-enriched and high-Nb dykes may relate to melting of a high field strength element-enriched source. Current Caribbean tectonic models involve the continuation of east-dipping Farallon Plate subduction beneath the proto-Caribbean seaway either until an Early Cretaceous initiation of proto-Caribbean subduction, or collision of the Caribbean Oceanic Plateau with the Greater Antilles Arc at ∼90–80 Ma. Both models may be compatible with the tectono-magmatic history of Tobago, wherein Tobago is thought to have detached from the fore-arc of the Caribbean arc system during Eocene intra-arc extension, the growth of the Grenada Basin, and inception of the Lesser Antilles Arc. Tobago- or La D{\'{e}}sirade-like Mesozoic arc crust underlies much of the present-day Lesser Antilles Arc and not, as has recently been proposed, portions of the plume-derived Caribbean Oceanic Plateau.},

The xenoliths include spinel harzburgites, spinel lherzolites and some pyroxenites. They show a wide range of textures from undeformed protogranular material through porphyroclastic to equigranular and recrystallised secondary types. Textural differences are strongly linked to trace element geochemistry and variations in radiogenic isotope ratios. Many undeformed protogranular xenoliths are Type IA LREE-depleted with MORB-type $\epsilon$Sr values between − 30.7 and − 23.6, and $\epsilon$Nd values + 13.9 to + 9.4. A second group of undeformed xenoliths are Type IB LREE-enriched with higher $\epsilon$Sr values (− 22.7 to − 10.6) and lower $\epsilon$Nd values (+ 11.9 to + 5.6). Deformed xenoliths with porphyroclastic, equigranular and secondary recrystallised textures are all Type IB (LREE-enriched, $\epsilon$Nd {\textless} 6.4, $\epsilon$Sr {\textgreater} 11.8). It is proposed that two separate events have given rise to the observed mixing arrays: (1) MORB-source depleted mantle was enriched by a component derived from an enriched mantle. Deformation and recrystallisation accompanied this event. (2) Subsequently, unenriched MORB-source mantle interacted with magmas chemically akin to the host basalts, and enrichment occurred with little deformation. Hypotheses of Tertiary mantle diapirism resulting in isochemical deformation and refinement of protogranular mantle to equigranular mantle are untenable because of differences in REE patterns and isotopic ratios between different textural groups.},

abstract = {Some F-rich granitic rocks show anomalous, nonchondritic ratios of Y/Ho, extreme negative Eu anomalies, and unusual, discontinuous, segmented chondrite-normalised plots of rare earth elements (REE). The effects of F-rich fluids have been proposed as one of the explanations for the geochemical anomalies in the evolved granitic systems, as the stability of nonsilicate complexes of individual rare earths may affect the fluid-melt element partitioning. The lanthanide tetrad effect, related to different configurations of 4f-electron subshells of the lanthanide elements, is one of the factors affecting such complexing behaviour. We present the first experimental demonstration of the decoupling of Y and Ho, and the tetrad effect in the partitioning of rare earths between immiscible silicate and fluoride melts. Two types of experiments were performed: dry runs at atmospheric pressure in a high-temperature centrifuge at 1100 to 1200°C, and experiments with the addition of H2O at 700 to 800°C and 100 MPa in rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels. Run products were analysed by electron microprobe (major components), solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (REE in the centrifuged runs), and laser ablation ICP-MS (REE and Li in the products of rapid-quench runs). All the dry centrifuge runs were performed at super-liquidus, two-phase conditions. In the experiments with water-bearing mixtures, minor amounts of aqueous vapour were present in addition to the melts. We found that lanthanides and Y concentrated strongly in the fluoride liquids, with two-melt partition coefficients reaching values as high as 100–220 in water-bearing compositions. In all the experimental samples, two-melt partition coefficients of lanthanides show subtle periodicity consistent with the tetrad effect, and the partition coefficient of Y is greater than that of Ho. One of the mixtures also produced abundant fluorite (CaF2) and cryolite (Na3AlF6) crystals, which enabled us to study fluorite-melt and cryolite-melt REE partitioning. REE concentrations in fluorite are high and comparable to those in the fluoride melt. However, fluorite-melt partition coefficients appear to depend mostly on ionic radii and show neither significant tetrad anomalies, nor differences in Y and Ho partitioning. In contrast, REE concentrations in cryolite are low (∼5–10 times lower than in the silicate melt), and cryolite-melt REE partitioning shows very strong tetrad and Y-Ho anomalies. Our results imply that Y-Ho and lanthanide tetrad anomalies are likely to be caused mainly by aluminofluoride complexes, and the tetrad REE patterns in natural igneous rocks can result from fractionation of F-rich magmatic fluids.},

abstract = {A clear-cut temporal and spatial relationship between small-volume, volatile-rich and highly potassic continental melt fractions, such as kimberlites and related rocks, and large-volume continental flood basalts exists in several Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). Many of these LIPs are also widely regarded as products of mantle plume-lithosphere interactions. The small-volume melts either immediately pre-date or post-date or even are co-eval with the main flood basalt event. The overlap of ages between the flood basalts and the kimberlites very likely reflects a cause and effect relationship via mantle plumes. Recently discovered end-Cretaceous diamondiferous kimberlites (orangeites) in the Bastar craton of central India which are synchronous with the flood basalts, carbonatites, lamprophyres and alkaline rocks of the Deccan LIP provide an opportunity to re-evaluate the role of mantle plume-lithosphere interactions in the generation of these disparate magmas. The geographical zonation of the kimberlite-lamprophyre-carbonatite-alkaline rock spectrum in the Deccan LIP is inferred to reflect variable thickness of the pre-Deccan Indian lithosphere with a thinner lithosphere along the known rift zones of northwestern and western India and a thickened lithosphere underlying the Bastar craton of central India. This heterogeneity is thought to have controlled the volume of melt generation and melt ascent, as well as the ultimate alkaline magma type. These findings are supported by the regional lithospheric thickness map, generated from converting seismic shear wave velocities into temperature profiles, which clearly depicts that the present-day lithosphere beneath the Bastar craton is thicker than that in western and NW India where the centre of the Deccan plume-head was located. Thermal weakening of the sub-Bastar craton due to mantle plume-lithosphere interaction at the end-Cretaceous resulting in a thin-spot is suggested to have controlled the Deccan-related mafic dyke emplacement in the Bastar craton. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Biotite is stable over the entire$\backslash$ntemperature interval, although it reacts progressively to hercynite$\backslash$n+ melt at the high end of the temperature range. Muscovite that survives$\backslash$ninitial melting breaks down to corundum + orthoclase between 700$\backslash$nand 725 degrees C. Minor corundum and aluminum silicate are present$\backslash$nat 650 degrees C, whereas corundum with a large sapphire (Fe + Ti)$\backslash$ncomponent is present at and above 700 degrees C. Finally, corundum$\backslash$nand hercynite exist with orthoclase-rich feldspar and remaining biotite$\backslash$nat 750 degrees C. The normative composition of melt at the minimum$\backslash$nis approximately Ab(30)Or(15)Ms(20)Qtz(35) (in weight percent) without$\backslash$nother minor components (e.g., cryolite). Both muscovite and its equivalent$\backslash$northoclase + corundum assemblage contribute substantial excess Al$\backslash$nto melt, bringing the value of the Al saturation index (ASI) of melt$\backslash$nto 1.4. Li, Rb, Cs, and F are strongly enriched in melts because$\backslash$nof the continuous reaction and reequilibration of biotite and muscovite$\backslash$nover the temperature interval. Concentrations of the femic components$\backslash$n(TiO2 + FeO + MgO + MnO) are low ({\textless}1 wt{\%}) but rise with temperature$\backslash$nprimarily because of increasing solubilities of FeO in melt. Calculated$\backslash$npartition coefficients, D(M)(Bt/gl), between biotite (Bt) and glass$\backslash$n(gl) for the element M show that D(Li)(Bt/gl) (1.7-1.0), D(Ba)(Bt/gl)$\backslash$n(similar to 14-6), and D(F)(Bt/gl) (2.5-1.5) all decrease with increasing$\backslash$ntemperature, whereas partition coefficients for Sr (approximate to$\backslash$n0.04), Rb (approximate to 2.0), and Cs (approximate to 0.4) remain$\backslash$nconstant with temperature over a large range of concentrations.

These results, together with other data$\backslash$nfor feldspar, suggest that Rb, Cs, and Ba become strongly fractionated$\backslash$nfrom one another during anatexis of aluminous metasediments and the$\backslash$nensuing crystallization of melts. Finally, the low partition coefficients$\backslash$nfor F between micas (biotite or muscovite) and melt indicate that$\backslash$nF-rich melts can be generated by the incipient hydrous anatexis of$\backslash$naluminous metasediments; models that invoke remelting of a dehydrated$\backslash$nprotolith to generate such F-rich melts may not be necessary.},

Adequate volumes of appropriateresiduarepresenting original (now Cr-depleted) source liquids appear to be missing from the sequence exposed, and the problem is exacerbated by exclusion of the Cr-poor lower Main Zone as a possible source. This raises questions regarding the shape of the magma chamber, the oxygen fugacity of the magmas, and the manner of magma emplacement. Problems in applying the magma-mixing hypothesis for the origin of chromitites are exposed.

Baddeleyite and zircon from early iron-oxide (magnetite, geikielite, spinel), apatite- and forsterite-bearing rocks have been dated to 590{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½6{\"{i}}¿½Ma using the LA-ICPMS U-Pb method, whereas monazites from anhydrite-apatite-carbonate rocks show a concordant U-Pb-Th age corresponding to 449{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½2{\"{i}}¿½Ma. Temperatures inferred from calcite-dolomite solvus data and graphite structural ordering span the interval from ≥{\"{i}}¿½815 to 276{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½C. Primary and secondary fluid inclusions in apatite document calciocarbonatite melts associated with early apatite, and CO2-bearing sulfate-chloride brines progressively diluted with low-salinity, probably metoric waters, towards ultimate stages of the deposit formation. The calciocarbonatite melts have initially coexisted with liquid nitrogen and later with sulfate-chloride brines mixed with N2{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½CO2gas. Crystallization of spinel around baddeleyite by the mechanism of Ostwald ripening, nucleation of graphite spherules along pyrrhotite-carbonate boundaries, the occurrence of molybdenite, baddeleyite-to-zircon transformation, and high crystallization temperatures inferred from graphite structural ordering and calcite-dolomite thermometry suggest a magmatic origin of the early mineral assemblages. In contrast, microthermometric characteristics of primary aqueous inclusions in the late apatite and the presence of zeolites (thomsonite-Ca, mezolite) is diagnostic of a low-temperature hydrothermal crystallization. Formation of the early magnetite-apatite-forsterite assemblage is thought to be coeval with mafic alkalic intrusions of the Mazerapane Suite superimposed on the granulite facies metamorphism of the Monapo Klippe. The low-temperature, anhydrite-bearing mineralization was associated with the massive circulation of sulfate-rich brines along fractures activated during the Late Cambrian-Ordovician extension. Origin of the sulfate-rich brines may be genetically related either with the magmatic-hydrothermal differentiation, or with the remobilization of crustal evaporites.},

abstract = {Pb isotopic compositions were measured in komatiites and other volcanic rocks from several Archean greenstone belts, and in magmatic and exhalative sulfides associated with these volcanics. Thin komatiite flows generally yielded PbPb isochron ages consistent with other geochronological or geological information, but thicker basaltic flows gave ages that are too young. These results suggest that the thin komatiite flows were hydrothermally altered during eruption and that this event is recorded by the PbPb age. Thicker basaltic flows resisted alteration during eruption but were affected by later events: their PbPb ages probably correspond to the time of metamorphism, and not to the time of emplacement. Magmatic and exhalative sulfides from the Abitibi Belt in Canada fall on the same trend in the 207Pb/204Pb206Pb/204Pb diagram as komatiites, basalts, sedimentary rocks and K-feldspars from granites. The calculated $\mu$1-value is 7.8±0.1. A similar suite of rocks and minerals from the Kambalda area in Australia has distinctly higher 207Pb204Pb and a higher $\mu$1 of 8.3. Nd isotopic data demonstrate that some Kambalda rocks are highly contaminated with older continental crust. The differences in initial Pb isotopic compositions are attributed to the presence or absence, and the age, of underlying granitoid basement. Kambalda greenstones are underlain and contaminated by old ({\textgreater} 3.0 Ga) granitoid crust but significantly older granitoid basement appears absent from the Abitibi Belt. The Pb isotopic compositions of Kambalda greenstones are dominated by the crustal component and do not represent the composition of the mantle source of these rocks. The Abitibi greenstones are not highly influenced by crustal contamination and their Pb isotopic compositions may reflect those of Archean mantle.},

abstract = {The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the largest known flood basalt provinces formed in the Phanerozoic, is associated with the pre-rift stage of the Atlantic Ocean at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary ca. 200 Ma. Paleomagnetic sampling targeted packages of CAMP lava flows in Morocco's High Atlas divided into four basic units (the lower, intermediate, upper, and recurrent units) from sections identified on the basis of field observations and geochemistry. Oriented cores were demagnetized using both alternating field (AF) and thermal techniques. Paleomagnetic results reveal wholly normal polarity interrupted by at least one brief reversed chron located in the intermediate unit, and reveal distinct pulses of volcanic activity identified by discrete changes in declination and inclination. These variations in magnetic direction are interpreted as a record of secular variation, and they may provide an additional correlative tool for identification of spatially separated CAMP lava flows within Morocco. 40Ar/39Ar analyses of Moroccan CAMP lavas yield plateau ages indistinguishable within 2$\sigma$ error limits, sharing a weighted mean age of 199.9±0.5 Ma (2$\sigma$), reinforcing the short-lived nature of these eruptions despite the presence of sedimentary horizons between them. Correlation of our sections with the E23n, E23r, E24 sequence reported in the Newark basin terrestrial section and St. Audrie's Bay marine section is suggested. Brief volcanism in sudden pulses is a potential mechanism for volcanic-induced climatic changes and biotic disruption at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. Combination of our directional group (DG) poles yields an African paleomagnetic pole at 200 Ma of $\lambda$(°N)=73.0°, ϕ(°E)=241.3° (Dp=5.0°, Dm=18.5°).},

abstract = {Phonolites of Palaeogene age occur at two different localities in central Namibia, occurring as clusters of eroded monogenetic lava domes. Six phonolites at Aris collectively exhibit a narrow compositional range and represent a single magma system of highly evolved phonolite with high concentrations of Na2O, Rb, Th, Zr, Zn, Pb, and REE and very low abundances of MgO, P2O5, Sr and Ba. No mafic rocks are associated with the Aris phonolites and their ultimate petrogenetic origin remains obscure. The more abundant Staalhart phonolites exhibit more variable but scattered compositional variation consistent with fractional crystallization dominated by sanidine (and nepheline) and pyroxene. The behaviour of REE is decoupled from Zr, Nb, and Th in this suite indicating a controlling role for minor phases in their evolution. The least evolved phonolites have initial87Sr/86Sr≈0.7043, which is identical to a small occurrence of associated plagioclase-bearing nephelinite indicating a possible petrogenetic link. Higher isotopic ratios in more evolved phonolites suggest their evolution was accompanied by some crustal interaction. Comparisons of phonolites world-wide indicate that they all have similar trace element abundance patterns when normalized to associated and possibly parental mafic compositions, regardless of proposed petrogenetic origins (melting, fractional crystallization, AFC, etc.). These patterns of similar pronounced enrichments of Rb, Th, Zr, strong depletions in Ti and P, and YbN{\textgreater}GdN(i.e. depletion of middle REE relative to heavy REE) confirm the suggestion that fractional crystallization is the dominant process by which phonolites evolve from mafic alkaline compositions. Despite similar published values of DEufor sanidine in silicic and phonolitic compositions, highly evolved phonolites develop only modest negative Eu anomalies compared to evolved silicic rocks. This might reflect differences in melt structure, fO2, halogen complexing or fractionating mineral assemblages in phonolite and silicic liquids. Sparse data on Eu partition coefficients in phonolite bulk compositions does not provide insight into the role of these controls of Eu partitioning in phonolite. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two occurrences of shear-related pseudotachylite from the Limpopo Metamorphic Province are described. In particular, the structural setting as well as deformation textures in pseudotachylite inclusions and host rocks are presented for these occurrences in gabbroic anorthosite from the Palala Shear Belt and dioritic to granodioritic rocks from the Sand River Gneiss locality. The Palala Shear Belt is a 13 km wide zone of intensely mylonitized rocks of the Beit Bridge and Bushveld Complexes, situated at the southern boundary of the Central Zone of the Limpopo Metamorphic Province. The Sand River Gneiss comprises a bimodal suite of high-grade dioritic and granodioritic rocks which were subjected to at least three periods of deformation. In the context of comparisons between pseudotachylites from different geological settings (i.e. cryptoexplosion structures, meteorite craters and tectonic settings) the major results are as follows: 1. (1) The deformation phenomena associated with pseudotachylite formation as recorded in quartz and feldspar, occurring as inclusions or at the host rock contact, are undulatory extinction in quartz, brecciation, mechanical twinning and kinking of plagioclase, and characteristic formation of irregular and planar (Vredefort-type) fractures, the latter occurring in quartz. 2. (2) Frequency distributions of crystallographic orientations of planar fractures and their annealed manifestation (planar fluid inclusion trails) are very similar for the Vredefort structure, the Sudbury structure, the Johannesburg dome, the Witwatersrand basin and the Limpopo pseudotachylites. It is therefore concluded that planar fractures in quartz are the typical microdeformation associated with pseudotachylite, irrespective of the geological setting of the latter. Planar fractures alone do not provide unambiguous information on the genesis of the structure in which they are found. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Kimberlite and carbonatite magmas that intrude cratonic lithosphere are among the deepest probes of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Their co-existence on thick continental shields is commonly attributed to continuous partial melting sequences of carbonated peridotite at {\textgreater}150 km depths, possibly as deep as the mantle transition zone. At Tikiusaaq on the North Atlantic craton in West Greenland, approximately 160 Ma old ultrafresh kimberlite dykes and carbonatite sheets provide a rare opportunity to study the origin and evolution of carbonate-rich melts beneath cratons. Although their Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb–Li isotopic compositions suggest a common convecting upper mantle source that includes depleted and recycled oceanic crust components (e.g., negative $\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf coupled with {\textgreater}+5‰$\delta$7Li), incompatible trace element modelling identifies only the kimberlites as near-primary low-degree partial melts (0.05–3{\%}) of carbonated peridotite. In contrast, the trace element systematics of the carbonatites are difficult to reproduce by partial melting of carbonated peridotite, and the heavy carbon isotopic signatures (−3.6 to −2.4‰$\delta$13C for carbonatites versus −5.7 to −3.6‰$\delta$13C for kimberlites) require open-system fractionation at magmatic temperatures. Given that the oxidation state of Earth's mantle at {\textgreater}150 km depth is too reduced to enable larger volumes of ‘pure' carbonate melt to migrate, it is reasonable to speculate that percolating near-solidus melts of carbonated peridotite must be silicate-dominated with only dilute carbonate contents, similar to the Tikiusaaq kimberlite compositions (e.g., 16–33 wt.{\%} SiO2). This concept is supported by our findings from the North Atlantic craton where kimberlite and other deeply derived carbonated silicate melts, such as aillikites, exsolve their carbonate components within the shallow lithosphere en route to the Earth's surface, thereby producing carbonatite magmas. The relative abundances of trace elements of such highly differentiated ‘cratonic carbonatites' have only little in common with those of metasomatic agents that act on the deeper lithosphere. Consequently, carbonatite trace element systematics should only be used with caution when constraining carbon mobility and metasomatism at mantle depths. Regardless of the exact nature of carbonate-bearing melts within the mantle lithosphere, they play an important role in enrichment processes, thereby decreasing the stability of buoyant cratons and promoting rift initiation – as exemplified by the Mesozoic–Cenozoic breakup of the North Atlantic craton.},

Zircon and glass were present in all run products, and small monazite crystals were present in eight of the 12 experiments. Average diameters of zircon crystals ranged from 5 to 20 $\mu$m at 800 °C to 30-50 $\mu$m at 1300 °C. Zircon crystals have thin rims, and adjacent glass has a narrow (∼1 $\mu$m thick) compositional boundary layer. Concentrations obtained through in-situ analysis of cores of run product zircon crystals and melt pools were used to calculate trace-element partition coefficients Dzircon/meltfor P, Sc, Ti, V, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Ho, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th, and U. In most cases Lu was the most (D 12-105) and La the least (0.06-0.95) compatible elements. D values from this study fall within the range of previously measured values for Rare Earth Elements (REE). However, D values measured experimentally show less fractionation than those recently measured using natural phenocryst/matrix pairs. For example, DLu/DLameasured experimentally in this study range between 27 and 206 compared to a value of 706,522 for a natural zircon/dacite pair [Sano, Y., Terada, K., and Fukuoka, T. 2002 High mass resolution ion microprobe analysis of rare earth elements in silicate glass, apatite and zircon: lack of matrix dependency. Chem. Geol. 184, 217-230]. Although D values from this study show good agreement with the lattice strain model, D values from natural phenocryst/matrix pairs combined with measured zircon compositions better reproduce host-rock (magma) compositions of igneous rocks. They also yield more reasonable estimates of magma compositions when combined with compositions of ''out-of-context" zircons. For example, compositions of the Hadean detrital zircons from Jack Hills, Australia yield LREE-enriched magmas when combined with D values from phenocryst/matrix pairs yields, but yield LREE-depleted magmas when experimentally determined D values are used. We infer that experimentally measured Dzircon/meltvalues represent disequilibrium partitioning resulting from rapid zircon growth during short laboratory timescales. Rapid growth causes development of observed diffusive boundary layers in the melt adjacent to zircon crystals. D values from phenocryst/matrix pairs are therefore recommended for petrogenetic modeling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

But the Cecil is also increasingly endangered by farming and development. Endangered dirt? Not that long ago, few researchers would have talked up the idea. But in recent years, efforts to identify the world's rare and endangered soils have been gaining momentum. Aided by increasingly powerful geographic information systems and Earth-observing sensors, researchers have begun mapping "pedodiversity"—the distribution and extent of different soils. This past summer, for example, Chinese researchers released the first-ever pedodiversity survey of that huge nation, identifying nearly 90 endangered soils—as well as at least two dozen that have already gone extinct. Similar surveys suggest unique dirt is also in danger in the United States, Europe, and Russia. And just as biologists have stepped up efforts to protect biodiversity, soil scientists are now trying to call attention to the need to preserve pedodiversity. Soil scientists are tracking down rare and endangered soils in a quest to document—and preserve—“pedodiversity.” Soil scientists are tracking down rare and endangered soils in a quest to document—and preserve—“pedodiversity.”},

@article{Marks2017,
abstract = {Peralkaline igneous rocks are defined by a molar (Na + K)/Al ratio {\textgreater} 1 and are subdivided into miaskitic and agpaitic varieties depending on their mineralogy. In the more common miaskitic types, rare earth elements (REEs) and high field strength elements (HFSEs) are largely stored in zircon and titanite, while agpaitic varieties contain a wealth of mostly halogen-bearing Na-Ca-HFSE minerals instead. Among those, minerals of the eudialyte, rinkite, and w{\"{o}}hlerite groups are the most common ones. The present review on the geological and mineralogical information available on agpaitic rocks provides a summary of the fluid inclusion record of miaskitic and agpaitic rocks as fluids play a key role in the evolution of peralkaline rocks. Magmas that crystallize peralkaline rocks are generally believed to originate from low-degree partial melting of geochemically enriched mantle lithologies, combined with prolonged differentiation processes at shallow crustal levels. Agpaitic and hyperagpaitic rocks (the latter containing appreciable amounts of water-soluble minerals) represent the most evolved stages of peralkaline systems. They form either parts of plutonic to subvolcanic composite magmatic complexes, which consist of several agpaitic and/or miaskitic intrusive units, or they occur as sills, laccoliths, domes, dykes, or even as lavas. However, as agpaitic rocks are notably rare compared to miaskitic rocks (about 100 vs. several thousand occurrences worldwide), their formation requires special conditions that are not generally met during the evolution of peralkaline rocks. Despite their rarity, agpaitic and hyperagpaitic rocks form important deposits of critical metals such as REE, Zr, Nb, and U and are interesting targets for otherwise rare elements such as F, Be, Sn, Zn, and Ga. The relative timing when magmas reach their agpaitic stage is highly variable. Magmatic–agpaitic assemblages can form only if early-magmatic crystallization conditions were reduced enough (low fO2) to enable subsequent Fe enrichment, an increase in peralkalinity, retention of halogens, and extreme enrichment of HFSEs in the evolving magmas, as only these contribute to the direct crystallization of agpaitic minerals. Late-magmatic interstitial agpaitic assemblages indicate that the required enrichment levels of the above-mentioned constituents were reached only during the final differentiation stages of magmas. Hydrothermal agpaitic assemblages precipitate from highly saline brines released from peralkaline magmas and are capable of transporting HFSEs. All three varieties of agpaitic assemblages occur in plutonic, subvolcanic, and volcanic rocks. Although many modern and detailed studies have dealt with plutonic–subvolcanic agpaitic rocks, most volcanic occurrences are insufficiently studied, mainly because of difficult outcrop or logistic situations. However, especially the volcanic examples raise questions on the details of why and how degassing of halogens at such shallow emplacement levels is sufficiently prevented to precipitate halogen-bearing agpaitic assemblages. Thus, a thorough geochemical and petrological investigation of such localities is desired. The presently valid definitions of agpaitic and miaskitic rocks are not appropriate, and therefore, alternative definitions are suggested. Similarly, the frequently used classification scheme for nepheline syenites must be abandoned as it is inconsistent and excludes very similar mineral assemblages observed in other partly even quartz-bearing rock types. Variable processes may produce sequences of mineral assemblages that belong to different groups of this classification. Therefore, we suggest that rather than dividing agpaitic rocks into specific subgroups, careful textural studies that distinguish early-magmatic, late-magmatic, and hydrothermal phase assemblages are warranted. This is the only way to understand the effect of various physicochemical parameters (such as P, T, fO2, aSiO2, aH2O, peralkalinity, and the activity of other compounds including halogens) during different evolutionary stages of these mineralogically and texturally diverse rocks.},

The ages and chemistry of these rocks overlap with rejuvenated lavas on nearby, northern Hawaiian Island shields (Ni‘ihau, Kaua‘i and South Kaua‘i Swell). Collectively, these rejuvenated lavas cover a vast area (∼7000 km2), much more extensive than any other area of rejuvenated volcanism worldwide. Ka‘ula rejuvenated lavas range widely in alkalinity and incompatible element abundances (e.g., up to 10× P2O5 at a given MgO value) and ratios indicating variable degrees of melting of a heterogeneous source. Heavy REE elements in Ka‘ula lavas are pinned at a mantle normalized Yb value of 10 ± 1, reflecting the presence of garnet in the source. Trace element ratios indicate the source also contained phlogopite and an Fe–Ti oxide. The new Ka‘ula ages show that rejuvenated volcanism was nearly coeval from ∼0.3 to 0.6 Ma along a 450 km segment of the Hawaiian Islands (from West Maui to north of Ka‘ula). The ages and volumes for rejuvenated volcanism are inconsistent with all but one geodynamic melting model proposed to date. This model advocates a significant contribution of pyroxenite to rejuvenated magmas. Analyses of olivine phenocryst compositions suggest a major (33–69{\%}) pyroxenite component in Ka‘ula rejuvenated lavas, which correlates positively with radiogenic Pb isotope ratios for Ka‘ula. This correlation is also observed in lavas from nearby South Kaua‘i lavas, as was reported for Atlantic oceanic islands. The presence of pyroxenite in the source may have extended the duration and volume of Hawaiian rejuvenated volcanism.},

Under all conditions, the tetrahedrally coordinated Al3+ displays strong preference for 3-dimensional network units in the melts. The relative abundance of 3-dimensional network units increases, therefore, with increasing Al/(Al + Si) of the melt even though its bulk NBO/T is unchanged (NBO/T, nonbridging O per tetrahedrally coordinated cation). This increase is compensated for by an increase in the relative abundance of anionic units with NBO/T .gtoreq.2. The proportion of units with NBO/T = 1 decreases. These effects become more pronounced with increasing pressure at the same temp. For basaltic liqs. with similar NBO/T and Al/(Al + Si) ratio, the type of charge-balancing cation for tetrahedrally coordinated Al3+ and the types of network-modifying metal cations control the relative importance of feldspar and olivine on the liquidus at 1 atm. Increasing M+/(M+ + M2+) results in an increase in the relative abundance of 3-dimensional aluminosilicate units and a decrease in SiO44- units in the liq. Thus, the liquidus vol. of 3-dimensional aluminosilicate minerals (feldspar) will increase as the alkali/alk. earth increases. This trend is borne out by exptl. phase-equil. measurements at 1 atm. on natural rock compns.},

Their calculated initial Os isotopic compositions likely reflect the compositions of the magmas from which they crystallized. The chromites show variable initial Os isotopic compositions ($\gamma$Os of +2.0 to +16.4) over the vertical extent of the Peridotite Zone, implicating at least two sources of Os. Both the range of $\gamma$Os and values of $\gamma$Os decrease upsection. These variations in $\gamma$Os were caused by mixing of variable proportions of two magmas having different Os isotopic compositions. One of the magmatic components was a more primitive magma with a nearly chondritic Os isotopic composition. The other magma had a radiogenic Os isotopic composition as a result of assimilation of crust, perhaps of sedimentary rocks beneath the Stillwater Complex. The gradual decrease in the initial $\gamma$Os values of the chromite layers with increasing stratigraphic height implies a decreasing relative contribution from the contaminated magma throughout the growth of the Peridotite Zone. Small variations in $\gamma$Os between different chromite occurrences within the H multicyclic unit reflects the petrologic requirement that chromite layers crystallize from slightly different proportions of the magmas, compared to chromite from olivine- and orthopyroxene-rich layers.},

abstract = {Major and trace element, Sr–Nd–Pb isotope and mineral chemical data are presented for mafic and felsic volcanic rocks from the island of Pantelleria. The mafic rocks, mostly basalts, range from hy-normative transitional basalts, through alkali basalts, to basanites. Clinopyroxene in the mafic rocks varies in composition from Al, Ti-poor diopside to Al, Ti-rich augite. These two populations can be present simultaneously in the same sample and even in the same crystal, suggesting polybaric fractionation in the pressure range 0–4 kbar, or mixing between basaltic magmas with different degrees of alkalinity. On the basis of their major and trace element and Sr–Nd–Pb isotope composition and age of eruption, two groups of basalts are distinguished: a high TiO2–P2O5 group, erupted before 50 ka BP, and a low TiO2–P2O5 group, erupted after 50 ka BP, separated by a caldera collapse. The felsic volcanic rocks have compositions ranging from comenditic trachyte to comendite and pantelleritic trachyte to pantellerite, with progressively increasing peralkalinity. The Sr–Nd isotope compositions of most of the felsic volcanic rocks are similar to those of the mafic volcanic rocks, except for some very Sr-poor pantellerites, which show post-depositional exchange with seawater strontium. On the basis of their petrographic and geochemical characteristics, Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data, computer modelling and geological observations, it is suggested that the mafic volcanic rocks represent a number of different alkaline parental magmas from which the felsic volcanic rocks were derived via prolonged, closed-system fractional crystallization. The source region for the parental magmas was heterogeneous, and may have involved at least two distinct geochemical components: a mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) source, relatively depleted component, and a HIMU-like enriched component. A further enriched component, similar to the Enriched Mantle 1 (EM 1) component, could also have been involved. According to geophysical data, the lithosphere is thinned beneath the island, and the asthenospheric mantle rises to a depth of 60 km. Rare earth element data require residual garnet in the source and constrain the melting process to a depth of 70–80 km. The petrological and geochemical data suggest that the mafic magmas are generated within the asthenospheric mantle, from a deep plume bringing the HIMU–EM 1 isotopic and trace element signatures. Interaction of these OIB-like magmas with the shallower asthenospheric mantle, providing a depleted MORB signature, gives rise to magmas with the observed isotopic and geochemical characteristics.},

abstract = {The Goboboseb–Messum volcanic centre is the source of two voluminous silicic eruptive sequences, the Goboboseb quartz latites (Units I–III), and the Springbok quartz latite unit (both within the Awahab Formation). Intrusive equivalents exist as plugs and a laccolith peripheral to the Messum Complex. The recognition of correlatives of these quartz latite units in the southeastern Paran{\'{a}} suggests eruptive volumes of ∼2320 km3 (Goboboseb units) and 6340 km3 (Springbok unit). The latter is thought to be a single eruptive event. Phenocryst assemblages are plagioclase (An51–63), pyroxene, titanomagnetite and apatite. Pyroxene assemblages range from augite, to augite + pigeonite, to pigeonite, to pigeonite ± hypersthene, the assemblages changing progressively from the Goboboseb unit through to the Springbok unit. Although pyroxene phenocrysts from individual samples are compositionally very uniform there is a small increase in Fe through the sequence, attributed to decreasing temperature (± pressure). Thermometry suggests melt temperatures {\textgreater}1000°C. Many plagioclases contain abundant glass inclusions of three compositional types, thought to result from active disequilibrium melting at magma chamber walls. Relatively small, but systematic, changes in whole-rock composition occur stratigraphically from the lowest Goboboseb unit through to the Springbok unit and to their correlatives in the Paran{\'{a}}, best shown by SiO2 (67–71{\%}) and FeO* (5.4–7.4{\%}) which increase and decrease, respectively, in the progressively younger eruptive phases. P, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb and Cu are positively correlated with FeO*, whereas $\epsilon$Sr and Pb isotope compositions correlate inversely with FeO*. Crust-normalized spidergram plots indicate strong negative Sr anomalies, accompanied by significant Eu/Eu* anomalies (0.62–0.67). The quartz latite melts can be interpreted in terms of large-scale assimilation–fractional crystallization (AFC)-style processes, involving high degrees of lower- and upper-crustal melting, with thermal and material input from hybridized LTZ.L-type basaltic magmas (Part I). Thermal source is inferred to be the Tristan plume. The crustal end-member is thought to be the mid-Proterozoic restite source of the Damara granites, although some shallower crustal input is also likely. Modelling suggests the source may be similar to A-type granites and charnockites (i.e. relatively REE and HFSE enriched). Available seismic data suggest a simple velocity crustal profile, possibly the result of the massive crustal and uppermost mantle melting that accompanied the evolution of the Awahab magma system.},

abstract = {Abstract The Green Tuff (GT) Plinian eruption, the largest in magnitude at Pantelleria, erupted 3 to 7 km3 DRE of pantellerite magma and a small volume of trachyte. Fifty-nine anorthoclase-hosted melt inclusions from the two basal pumice members were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy in order to assess the pre-eruptive H2O content in the pantellerite melt. Microanalytical methods were used to determine major element, Cl, F and S contents. Melt inclusions and glassy groundmasses have a nearly homogeneous pantelleritic composition (peralkaline index = 1.9-2.2) and variable water contents ranging from 1.4 to as high as 4.2 wt {\%}, i.e. much higher than the 1.4 wt {\%} of earlier published studies. The chlorine content is constant at about 1 wt {\%}. Combined Cl and H2O data were used to estimate a confining pressure of about 50 MPa (depth around 2-3 km) for the GT magma chamber. The chamber was characterized by a compositional zoning with a dominant pantellerite overlying a trachyte magma. Soon after the GT eruption, intra-caldera volcanism was dominated by the eruption of voluminous trachyte lava flows, while pantellerite melt production resumed after about 20 ka with numerous low-volume, mildly explosive (Strombolian) to effusive eruptions. Comparison with data from the literature reveals that, despite the different explosivity, the post-caldera Strombolian eruptions and the GT Plinian eruption were fed by pantelleritic magmas with similar water contents. Chlorine and CO2 contents suggest that the young magma reservoirs feeding the Strombolian to effusive activity were deeper (h ≥ 4.5 km) than the much larger (based on erupted volumes) magma chamber which fed the GT eruption.},

abstract = {Total CO2 output from fumaroles, bubbling and water dissolved gases and soil gases was investigated at Pantelleria Island volcano, Italy. The preliminary results indicate an overall output of 0.39 Mt a−1 of CO2 from the island. The main contribution to the total output was from diffuse soil degassing (about 0.32 Mt a−1), followed by dissolved CO2 (0.034 Mt a−1), focussed soil degassing (0.028 Mt a−1) and bubbling CO2 (0.013 Mt a−1). The contribution of CO2 from fumarole gases was found to be negligible (1.4×10−6 Mt a−1). Carbon-13 values for CO2 coupled with those for associated He in gases from fumaroles and sites of focussed soil degassing clearly rule out any significant organic CO2 component and suggest a common mantle origin for these gas species. The inferred mantle source beneath Pantelleria would seem to have peculiar geochemical characteristics, quite distinct from those of mantle producing MORB but compatible with those of magmatic sources of central Mediterranean and central European volcanoes. These findings indicate that the Pantelleria volcanic complex is a site of active mantle degassing that is worthy of attention for future geochemical surveillance of the island.},

abstract = {Rare elements include rare-earth elements (REE), Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf. As a group, these elements are concentrated in the crust and are incompatible (remain in the melt rather than substitute into silicate minerals). Carbonatites host the most important deposits of REE and Nb, although peralkaline granites and silica under saturated rocks also host deposits of these elements. By contrast, Ta is concentrated in peraluminous granites and pegmatites. The former types of deposits are characterized by rift and anorogenic tectonic settings, whereas the latter, most typically, are in collisional settings. Rare elements are concentrated by magmatic processes; in silicate melts one of the most important controls on rare element mineral solubility is the (Na+K)/Al ratio of the melt. Their solubilities are also temperature dependent and both these parameters may control magmatic ore deposition. Fluid-melt partition coefficients are typically low, but nonetheless the grades in many rare-element deposits are highest where hydrothermal alteration is strongly developed. Rare elements are hard acids in the Pearson sense and they prefer to bond electrostatically to form aqueous complexes with hard bases such as F- and OH-, as well as SO42-, CO32-, and PO43-. Fluid mixing may be the principal control of mineralization in hydrothermal systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The isotopic data from the pyroxenites define a Re–Os regression line with an age (2011 ± 51 Ma) that agrees within uncertainty with the accepted age for the Bushveld complex, whereas the parapyroxenite data scatter about this trend. The initial 187Os/188Os ratios of the pyroxenites (0.1820–0.1848) are similar to, but slightly more radiogenic than, previously published values for the Merensky Reef. Our preferred interpretation is that this section of the Platreef formed from a well mixed, crustally contaminated magma, genetically related to that which gave rise to the Merensky Reef. The Platreef parental magma may also have experienced minor additional contamination by wall rock interaction during emplacement.},

abstract = {The Rustenberg Layered Suite of the Bushveld Complex originated in the mantle, but is characterized by variably radiogenic strontium, neodymium, lead and osmium initial isotope ratios and more elevated $\delta$18O values than expected from a partial melt of primitive mantle. It is not clear whether Bushveld magmas assimilated material from the crust, or whether they were instead generated from an eclogitic mantle source that contained crustal material. Here we report the $\Delta$33S of fifteen whole-rock and sulfide separate samples from both the Main and Critical Zones of the Bushveld, including the UG2 Chromitite and the Merensky Reef. All samples have positive $\Delta$33S values (0.11±0.02‰, 1$\sigma$) and $\delta$34S values (2.2±0.6‰, 1$\sigma$). Non-zero $\Delta$33S is fundamentally a surface process. Since high-temperature processes are not known to produce significant change in $\Delta$33S, the positive $\Delta$33S indicates that the Bushveld sulfur contains a sedimentary or surface-derived component. The homogeneity of $\Delta$33S values for this suite of samples contrasts with the heterogeneity displayed by strontium, neodymium, lead and osmium initial isotope ratios of the Bushveld and requires that the sulfur contamination occurred prior to the emplacement of the Bushveld in the upper crust. Possible sources of contamination include lower crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Limited multiple sulfur isotopic measurements of these reservoirs exist; more work needs to be done to constrain whether they contain surface-derived sulfur with non-zero $\Delta$33S, and if they do, whether the concentrations and isotopic compositions of these reservoirs can explain the measured $\Delta$33S of the Bushveld.},

abstract = {A correct description and quantification of the geochemical behaviour of REE+Y (rare earth elements and Y) and HFSE (high field strength elements) is a key requirement for modeling petrological and volcanological aspects of magma dynamics. In this context, mafic alkaline magmas (MAM) are characterized by the ubiquitous stability of clinopyroxene from mantle depths to shallow crustal levels. On one hand, clinopyroxene incorporates REE+Y and HFSE at concentration levels that are much higher than those measured for olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. On the other hand, the composition of clinopyroxene is highly sensitive to variations in pressure, temperature, and melt-water content, according to exchange-equilibria between jadeite and melt, and between jadeite/Ca-Tschermak and diopside-hedenbergite. As a consequence, the dependence of the partition coefficient on the physicochemical state of the system results in a variety of DREE+Yand DHFSEvalues that are sensitive to the magmatic conditions at which clinopyroxenes nucleate and grow. In order to better explore magma dynamics using clinopyroxene chemical changes, an integrated P-T-H2O-lattice strain model specific to MAM compositions has been developed. The model combines a set of refined clinopyroxene-based barometric, thermometric and hygrometric equations with thermodynamically-derived expressions for the lattice strain parameters, i.e., the strain-free partition coefficient (D0), the site radius (r0), and the effective elastic modulus (E). Through this approach, it is found that the incorporation of REE+Y and HFSE into M2 and M1 octahedral sites of clinopyroxene is determined by a variety of physicochemical variables that may or may not change simultaneously during magma differentiation. The applicability of the P-T-H2O-lattice strain model to natural environments has been verified using clinopyroxene-melt pairs from a great number of volcanic eruptions at Mt. Etna volcano (Sicily, Italy). DREE+Yand DHFSEvalues recovered by the model have been used as input data to quantify fractional crystallization processes in natural MAM compositions. Results from calculation illustrate that the concentration of REE+Y and HFSE in the magma is primary controlled by the geochemical evolution of clinopyroxene in terms of major cation exchange-equilibria and trace cation lattice strain properties.},

@article{Liegeois1998,
abstract = {Abundant high-K calc-alkaline (HKCA) magmatism appears to be post-collisional and often shifts to shoshonitic or alkaline–peralkaline compositions in the final stages of orogeny. The nature and the causes of this transition are studied on the basis of 308 major element and of 86 unpublished trace element (including REE) analyses of the Pan-African granitoids from the Tuareg shield (Adrar des Iforas, Mali and Aı̈r, Niger). This database covers a wide variety of magmas from subduction-related to intraplate-type including abundant HKCA batholiths. Literature data from geodynamically well-constrained cases are also included. In addition to a conventional geochemical approach of the studied magmatism, the sliding normalization method is proposed. This tool aims at comparing magmatic series: each studied rock is normalized to the interpolated composition of the reference series that has the same SiO2 content as the sample. This method amplifies differences in sources and in fractionation processes and allows comparison of rocks from basic to acid composition. Two distinct juvenile sources are proposed: a previously enriched phlogopite-K richterite bearing lithospheric mantle or a lower juvenile crustal equivalent for HKCA-shoshonitic magmas, and a lowest lithospheric-upper asthenospheric OIB-type mantle for alkaline-peralkaline magmatism. The first source is melted only shortly after its generation when the lithosphere was still hot, which restricts HKCA magmatism mainly to post-collisional settings. The second asthenospheric/lowest lithosphere source is by definition close to its melting temperature and can generate magma ubiquitously both in space and time. The main melting triggers are lithospheric major structures which are not only operative in a post-collisional setting but also in other environments such as intraplate setting. Geochemistry thus gives indications about the nature of the source and on geotectonic settings. However, the latter is a second rank information, which is partly model-dependant. The post-collisional period differs from other settings by a propensity to generate large amounts of magma of various kinds, among which HKCA magmatism is volumetrically the most prominent.},

abstract = {Despite the growing evidence that the vapor phase, formed through magma degassing and ore fluid boiling, can selectively concentrate and transport metals, the effects of major volatile components like sulfur, chlorine or carbon dioxide on the metal vapor–liquid fractionation and vapor-phase transport under magmatic-hydrothermal conditions remain poorly known. We performed systematic experiments to investigate the effect of sulfur ligands on metal vapor–liquid partitioning in model H2O–S–NaCl–KCl–NaOH systems at temperatures from 350 to 500 °C. Results show that at acidic-to-neutral conditions, vapor–liquid equilibrium distribution coefficients, Km = mvapor / mliquid, where m is the mass concentration of the metal in corresponding phase, of metalloids (As, Sb) and base metals (Zn, Fe, Pb, Ag) are in the range 0.1–1.0 and 0.001–0.1, respectively, and are not significantly affected by the presence of geologically common sulfur concentrations, up to 1–3 wt.{\%} S. In contrast, the partitioning of Cu, Au, and Pt into the vapor increases by a factor of 100 in comparison to the S-free water–salt system, yielding Km values of 0.5–1.0, 1–10, and 10–20, respectively, due to formation of volatile neutral complexes with H2S and, possibly, SO2. In neutral-to-basic systems, Zn, Pb, Fe and Ag show 10–100-fold increase of their partition coefficients, whereas Cu, Au and Pt exhibit Km values of up to several orders of magnitude lower, compared to acidic conditions at similar temperature, pressure and sulfur contents. These vapor–liquid distribution patterns result from combined effects of i) formation of volatile species with reduced sulfur ligands in the vapor phase, ii) changes in the metal speciation in the coexisting liquid phase as a function of pH, and iii) solute–solvent interactions in both phases. Our data explain the vapor–liquid fractionation trends for many metals as inferred in coexisting brine and vapor inclusions from magmatic-hydrothermal deposits, and provide a first experimental evidence for the dramatic increase of the mobility of Cu, Au and Pt in sulfur-enriched acidic magmatic-hydrothermal vapors, consistent with geological models of Au ± Cu ores formation and distribution in porphyry-epithermal settings.},

abstract = {We present experimental phase equilibria carried out on a pantelleritic bulk-rock composition with a peralkalinity index [PI = molar (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3] = 1{\textperiodcentered}4, which is representative of the most energetic pumice fall eruption of the resurgent post-caldera volcanism on Pantelleria island. For the explored conditions (P = 25–150 MPa; T = 680–800°C; H2Omelt up to 6 wt {\%}; fO2 ≤ NNO, where NNO is nickel–nickel oxide buffer) clinopyroxene is the liquidus phase followed by alkali feldspar and then quartz. The crystallization of amphibole is limited to temperatures below 700°C. Aenigmatite crystallizes near the liquidus for P ≥ 100 MPa. When clinopyroxene is the sole liquidus phase, the coexisting melt is characterized by a decrease in peralkalinity index to 1{\textperiodcentered}2, if compared with the starting material, approaching comendite composition. In contrast, when alkali feldspar joins the liquidus phase assemblage, residual melts become extremely peralkaline (PI = 3{\textperiodcentered}2), with FeO contents in excess of 14 wt {\%}. Comparison of our experiments with natural phase abundances and compositions constrains the depth of the Fastuca pantellerite reservoir to be around 5 ± 1 km (or P = 120 ± 20 MPa) at T = 730 ± 10°C, with H2Omelt around 4 wt {\%}, and fO2 1{\textperiodcentered}5 log unit below NNO. Such conditions correspond to the dominant phase assemblage of feldspar, clinopyroxene and aenigmatite. Amphibole occurrence requires both higher melt water contents and lower temperatures (up to 6{\textperiodcentered}5 wt {\%} at 680°C), and may reflect provenance from a deeper and wetter portion of the tapped reservoir. In contrast, quartz is more probably related to crystallization during magma ascent, which explains the lower melt water content of its melt inclusions. Overall, the results confirm that pantellerites may be both water-rich and reduced magmas. These characteristics imply that any coexisting fluid phase in the reservoir will be dominated by water and hydrogen species, the latter amounting to a few mole per cent. Magma unrest at Pantelleria may thus be heralded by emissions of hydrous and reduced gases (i.e. CO2-poor and H2-rich), if the present-day reservoir is felsic in composition.},

abstract = {The eruption of calciocarbonatites at Earth's surface is at odds with them being equilibrated with the mantle at depth because high-pressure experimental studies predict that significant magnesium contents should be expected. Here we report on new high-pressure experiments that demonstrate extreme calcium enrichment of carbonatites en route to the surface. We have monitored the decompression of partially molten carbonated peridotite using a multianvil apparatus coupled to synchrotron radiation. The experimental charge was molten at high pressure and high temperature, before being decompressed along a path that avoided the so-called "carbonate ledge" (a boundary that prevents carbonatitic melts from reaching the surface). Reaction with clinopyroxene yields calcium enrichment and magnesium depletion. The resulting Ca/(Ca + Mg) of the quenched melt reaches 0.95, which compares well with the composition of erupted calcic carbonatites [Ca/(Ca + Mg) similar to 0.96-0.99] and of calcic melts trapped in mantle xenoliths from ocean islands [Ca/(Ca + Mg) similar to 0.84-0.97]. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to bring carbonatites very close to the surface, without breakdown, and therefore without catastrophic CO2 release. Such occurrence appears to be favored by hot geotherms, meaning that higher temperatures tend to stabilize carbonatitic melts at shallow mantle pressure. Carbonatitic magmas are usually associated with low temperatures, because of the assumed low melting degree or low eruption temperature of the only active carbonatite volcano (i.e., Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania). Here we show that emplacement of carbonatites at or near the surface necessitates a hot environment.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Wynniatt Formation, part of the upper Shaler Supergroup, is exposed in the Minto Inlier of Victoria Island, Canada, and was deposited in the intracratonic Amundsen Basin. The unit consists of a southwest-thickening (480 to 1000m over {\~{}}300km) shallowing-upward succession of three carbonate ramp sequences separated by regional unconformities. In ascending order: 1) inner to outer ramp carbonate facies, gradationally overlain by siliciclastic rocks of a pro-delta slope setting; 2) inner to mid-ramp subtidal carbonate facies, including a regional stromatolitic barrier system; and 3) outer ramp carbonate (gravity flow) facies overlain by shallowing-upward subtidal to intertidal, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate inner ramp facies. Spatial arrangements of nineteen lithofacies illustrates that each carbonate ramp sequence represents part of a distally steepened, storm-dominated carbonate ramp, with an interval of deep-water carbonate rocks coincident with oceanic restriction that elevated salinity. Migration of depocentre loci for successive ramp stages reflects changing patterns of subsidence. This may identify far-field extensional effects in this intracratonic basin because ages of the lower ({\~{}}850Ma) and middle ({\~{}}761Ma) formation bracket initiation of supercontinent (Rodinia) break-up. Our work offers an improved sedimentary framework for interbasinal correlation with coeval Neoproterozoic basins.

abstract = {Basalts from the volcano-sedimentary Eriksfjord Formation (Gardar Province, South Greenland) were erupted at around 1.2 Ga into rift-related graben structures. The basalts have compositions transitional between tholeiite and alkaline basalt with MgO contents {\textless}7 wt.{\%} and they display LREE-enrichment relative to a chondritic source. Most of the trace element and REE characteristics are similar to those of basalts derived from OIB-like mantle sources. Initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of clinopyroxene separates range from 0.70278 to 0.70383 and initial $\epsilon$Nd values vary from −3.2 to +2.1. The most unradiogenic samples overlap with the field defined by carbonatites of similar age and can be explained by mixing of isotopically depleted and enriched mantle components. Using AFC modelling equations, the Sr-Nd isotope data of the more radiogenic basalts can successfully be modelled by addition of {\textless}5{\%} lower crustal granulite-facies gneisses as contaminants. $\delta$18Ov-smow values of separated clinopyroxene range from +5.2 to +6.0‰ and fall within the range of typical mantle-derived rocks. However, up to 10{\%} mixing with an average lower crustal component are permitted by the data.},

abstract = {The effects of composition and temperature on the partitioning behavior of Sc, Y, and the rare earth elements (REEs) between high-Ca clinopyroxene and natural silicate melts were evaluated from doped experiments on natural mafic to intermediate composition lavas at 1 atmosphere pressure. Partition coefficients for these elements were found to be dependent on temperature and composition. The most important compositional parameters controlling clinopyroxene-melt partitioning for Y, Sc, and REEs are Al content of the liquid and pyroxene Ca content. Towards the goal of deriving expressions describing partitioning behavior, approximations were made of equilibrium constants for reactions involving a REE-Al component in the pyroxene. Regression of these equilibrium constants over the experimental temperature range (1180-1050??C) produced expressions which, when applied to the experimental glasses, reproduced the clinopyroxene trace element contents with precisions between 9 and 32{\%} (1??). The most important conclusion of this work is that pyroxene-melt partition coefficients for trivalent cations have different compositional dependencies than divalent cations because of the participation of Al in paired substitution. Values for high-Ca pyroxene Sc, Y, and REE partition coefficients have a range of over a factor of two between alkali basalts, andesites, and tholeiitic basalts (e.g., 0.2-0.7 for Sm at 1100??C). This represents a large proportion of the total range for D values from all mafic and intermediate magmas. Our contribution is to describe the parameters that control partitioning behavior. This will allow us to more accurately determine REE partitioning for specific systems. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Radiogenic isotope compositions of Hf and Nd are typically coupled in Phanerozoic and Proterozoic mafic rocks due to a similar behaviour of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd during mantle melting. Eoarchean rocks, for instance those from southern West Greenland, exhibit an apparent decoupling of Hf and Nd isotope compositions. This apparent decoupling may either indicate metamorphic disturbance or, alternatively, mirror early differentiation processes in the silicate Earth. To evaluate the issue, we performed combined measurements of Hf-Nd isotope compositions together with major and trace element concentrations for well preserved {\textgreater}3720 to {\textgreater}3800. Ma old tholeiitic metabasalts and gabbros from the ???3700. Ma and ???3800. Ma old terranes of the Isua Supracrustal Belt, southern West Greenland. In contrast to younger mafic rocks, calculated initial ??Hf-??Nd values of the Isua tholeiites show similar spreads and are both near chondritic to strongly depleted (-0.7 to +6.3 and -0.8 to +4.4, respectively), also in contrast to previously reported more depleted signatures in nearby boninite-like metabasalts of the Garbenschiefer unit. An evaluation of alteration effects based on preserved major and trace element arrays reveals pristine magmatic trends and therefore the measured isotope compositions indeed in most cases characterize contrasting Eoarchean mantle sources. In accord with this view, compositions of the Isua metabasalts yield Eoarchean regression ages in Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isochron spaces, overlapping with emplacement ages inferred from crosscutting relationships with tonalites. Lutetium-Hf systematics of the Isua metabasalts studied here, yield clear isochron relationships. For both terranes, there is some scatter in Sm-Nd space, indicating early disturbance of the Sm-Nd system close in time to the extrusion ages, possibly by seafloor alteration. Trace element compositions of the metabasalts indicate an arc setting and a strong source overprint by melt-like subduction components. It is likely, that the source overprint may have caused partial decoupling of the ??Hf-??Nd values, due to selective addition of Nd as observed in modern subduction settings. In this case, the most radiogenic initial ??Nd and ??Hf isotope values characterize the most depleted mantle sources, and less radiogenic values would reflect increased contributions of isotopically more enriched subduction components. However, the most depleted samples still exhibit decoupled Hf-Nd compositions, making a case for the presence of even older mantle heterogeneities. A proposed superchondritic composition of the silicate Earth (SCHEM), however, cannot account for the most depleted sample compositions. Conversely, a depleted upper mantle formed by crystallization of perovskite-rich cumulates in the early Hadean may well explain these observed compositions. A literature survey reveals an overlap in initial Hf-Nd compositions between southern West Greenland TTGs and the metabasalts analyzed here. This overlap suggests a genetic relationship between these lithologies, where the TTGs may have inherited their unusual Hf-Nd compositions from mafic precursors isotopically similar in composition to the Isua tholeiites. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Experimental determination of over seventy sets of clinopyroxene/silicate liquid (glass) partitition coefficients (D) for four rare earth elements (REE — La, Sm, Ho, Lu) in a range of REE-enriched natural rock compositions (basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite and rhyodacite) demonstrate a convex upward pattern, favouring the heavy REE (Ho, Lu) and markedly discriminating against the light REE (La). These patterns are consistent with previously documented clinopyroxene D values reported from natural phenocryst/matrix pairs and from experimental work using either REE-enriched compositions and electron microprobe analytical techniques (as in the present study) or natural or synthetic undoped compositions and mass spectrometric, ion probe or X-ray autoradiographic analytical techniques. However, the large data base in the present study allows evaluation of the effect of compositional and physical parameters on REE partitioning relationships. Considering DHo, it is shown that (1) D increases 6-fold with increasing SiO2 content of the coexisting liquid from ∼ 50 to ∼ 70 wt{\%} SiO2 (2) D increases 4-fold with decreasing temperature from 1,120°C to 900° C (3) D increases 2-fold with increasing pressure from ∼ 2.5 to 20 kb. (4) D increases ∼ 2-fold fO2 increases from approximately that of the MW buffer to the HM buffer (5) D remains unchanged within experimental error as the water content of the melt changes from ∼ 0.3 to ≳ 10{\%} by weight H2O. The absolute REE content of the clinopyroxene shows no consistent trend with temperature, but decreases slightly with increasing pressure, paralleling an increase in the jadeite component of the pyroxene. Thus the increase in D with increasing pressure is attributed to changes in the silicate liquid structure, which discriminate against accommodation of REE with increasing pressure. The clinopyroxene REE content increases with increasing fO2, and in this case the increase in D with increasing fO2 may be attributed mainly to this change in the clinopyroxene composition. Application of the present results to geochemical modelling allows a more appropriate choice of D values, according to the liquid composition and physical conditions applicable in the modelled system. They may also be used to evaluate cognate or xenocrystic relationships between clinopyroxene megacrysts and their host matrix.},

abstract = {Kimberlite magmatism has occurred in cratonic regions on every continent. The global age distribution suggests that this form of mantle melting has been more prominent after 1.2 Ga, and notably between 250–50 Ma, than during early Earth history before 2 Ga (i.e., the Paleoproterozoic and Archean). Although preservation bias has been discussed as a possible reason for the skewed kimberlite age distribution, new treatment of an updated global database suggests that the apparent secular evolution of kimberlite and related CO2-rich ultramafic magmatism is genuine and probably coupled to lowering temperatures of Earth's upper mantle through time. Incipient melting near the CO2- and H2O-bearing peridotite solidus at {\textgreater}200 km depth (1100–1400 °C) is the petrologically most feasible process that can produce high-MgO carbonated silicate melts with enriched trace element concentrations akin to kimberlites. These conditions occur within the convecting asthenospheric mantle directly beneath thick continental lithosphere. In this transient upper mantle source region, variable CHO volatile mixtures control melting of peridotite in the absence of heat anomalies so that low-degree carbonated silicate melts may be permanently present at ambient mantle temperatures below 1400 °C. However, extraction of low-volume melts to Earth's surface requires tectonic triggers. Abrupt changes in the speed and direction of plate motions, such as typified by the dynamics of supercontinent cycles, can be effective in the creation of lithospheric pathways aiding kimberlite magma ascent. Provided that CO2- and H2O-fluxed deep cratonic keels, which formed parts of larger drifting tectonic plates, existed by 3 Ga or even before, kimberlite volcanism could have been frequent during the Archean. However, we argue that frequent kimberlite magmatism had to await establishment of an incipient melting regime beneath the maturing continents, which only became significant after secular mantle cooling to below 1400 °C during post-Archean times, probably sometime shortly after 2 Ga. At around this time kimberlites replace komatiites as the hallmark mantle-derived magmatic feature of continental shields worldwide. The remarkable Mesozoic–Cenozoic ‘kimberlite bloom' between 250–50 Ma may represent the ideal circumstance under which the relatively cool and volatile-fluxed cratonic roots of the Pangea supercontinent underwent significant tectonic disturbance. This created more than 60{\%} of world's known kimberlites in a combination of redox- and decompression-related low-degree partial melting. Less than 2{\%} of world's known kimberlites formed after 50 Ma, and the tectonic settings of rare ‘young' kimberlites from eastern Africa and western North America demonstrate that far-field stresses on cratonic lithosphere enforced by either continental rifting or cold subduction play a crucial role in enabling kimberlite magma transfer to Earth's surface.},

abstract = {Paresis is one of a group of Cretaceous ring complexes extending from the coast some 350 km NE across the Damara Belt. It consists of over 90{\%} rhyolites and comendites, with subordinate intrusions of quartz syenite and alkali-feldspar syenite. These felsic units are accompanied by very minor amounts of silica-undersaturated basalt, phonolite and lamprophyre. Located near the edge of the Congo Craton, Paresis is the farthest inland of any felsic complex in the Cretaceous ring complex group. The other ring complexes in the vicinity consist of carbonatites and undersaturated alkaline rocks (e.g., Okorusu, Kalkfeld, Etaneno, Ondurakorume). Geochemical and isotopic data provide evidence for both mantle and crustal components in the sources of the Paresis magmas. The alkaline basalts, phonolite and lamprophyre have overlapping Sr and Nd isotopic initial ratios which plot within the mantle array close to bulk-earth values ($\epsilon$Nd=−0.9 to −2.8 and 87Sr/86Sr(i)=0.7042–0.7054) and may indicate a mantle plume component. The rhyolite units comprise metaluminous feldspar rhyolites and peraluminous, more differentiated quartz-feldspar rhyolites. Both units show prominent negative Nb and Ta anomalies on mantle-normalized multielement diagrams and have extremely nonradiogenic Nd ratios ($\epsilon$Nd=−21) and Sr initial ratios of 0.7117–0.7138. These isotopic values suggest a crustal origin from pre-Damara (Early Precambrian) gneisses and granitoids, which are exposed in the Congo craton and related inliers in northern Namibia. The comendites are peralkaline, highly differentiated rocks. In contrast to the rhyolites, comendites lack mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies, have higher HFSE and LREE contents, extreme negative Eu anomalies and $\epsilon$Nd values of −11. Like the comendites, alkali-feldspar syenites are peralkaline, lack Nb and Ta anomalies, have negative Eu anomalies and high HFSE concentrations. Their $\epsilon$Nd values are −6.5 to −8. The quartz syenites overlap with the peralkaline units in isotopic composition but they are chemically very different. They are metaluminous, have a low degree of differentiation and have prominent negative mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies like the rhyolites. The Sr–Nd isotopic composition and incompatible element ratios of the comendites, quartz syenites and alkali-feldspar syenites are intermediate between those of the rhyolites and basalts, precluding a simple origin by basalt fractionation or crustal melting. Instead, the data indicate that the comendite and syenites formed from hybrid magmas with both crustal and mantle-derived components. The metaluminous quartz syenites can be modelled by assimilation of pre-Damara crust by basaltic magma. The peralkaline nature and trace element characteristics of comendite and alkali-feldspar syenites, on the other hand, require an alkaline and HFSE-enriched basic endmember, whose fractionated equivalent may be the Paresis phonolite.},

abstract = {Abundant high-K calc-alkaline (HKCA) magmatism appears to be post-collisional and often shifts to shoshonitic or alkaline-peralkaline compositions in the final stages of orogeny. The nature and the causes of this transition are studied on the basis of 308 major element and of 86 unpublished trace element (including REE) analyses of the Pan-African granitoids from the Tuareg shield (Adrar des Iforas, Mali and Air, Niger). This database covers a wide variety of magmas from subduction-related to intraplate-type including abundant HKCA batholiths. Literature data from geodynamically well-constrained cases are also included. In addition to a conventional geochemical approach of the studied magmatism, the sliding normalization method is proposed. This tool aims at comparing magmatic series: each studied rock is normalized to the interpolated composition of the reference series that has the same SiO2 content as the sample. This method amplifies differences in sources and in fractionation processes and allows comparison of rocks from basic to acid composition. Two distinct juvenile sources are proposed: a previously enriched phlogopite-K richterite bearing lithospheric mantle or a lower juvenile crustal equivalent for HKCA-shoshonitic magmas, and a lowest lithospheric-upper asthenospheric OIB-type mantle for alkaline-peralkaline magmatism. The first source is melted only shortly after its generation when the lithosphere was still hot, which restricts HKCA magmatism mainly to post-collisional settings. The second asthenospheric/lowest lithosphere source is by definition close to its melting temperature and can generate magma ubiquitously both in space and time. The main melting triggers are lithospheric major structures which are not only operative in a post-collisional setting but also in other environments such as intraplate setting. Geochemistry thus gives indications about the nature of the source and on geotectonic settings. However, the latter is a second rank information, which is partly model-dependent. The post-collisional period differs from other settings by a propensity to generate large amounts of magma of various kinds, among which HKCA magmatism is volumetrically the most prominent.},

The stability of sodalite in these assemblages was studied in the range 500–700 °C and 600–2000 bars fluid pressure. Sodalite appears to be a stable phase on the vapor-saturated liquidus in this system over a wide range of pressure. At or near the vapor-saturated liquidus minimum in this system, three distinct types of sodalite-bearing syenite can crystallize.

abstract = {Geochemical and Nd-Sr-O whole rock isotope data and Pb isotope data from leached feldspars for a suite of synorogenic (ca. 540 Ma) syenites and granites from the northern part of the Proterozoic Damara orogen (Namibia) constrain their sources and petrogenesis. Major rock types are mildly potassic nepheline syenites and quartz syenites that were primarily generated by fractional crystallization from a mantle-derived alkaline magma. Even the most primitive samples show pronounced depletion in Nb, Ti, Sr, and P on a primitive mantle-normalized diagram, indicating the involvement of a recycled crustal component in the source. Extrapolation of the Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotope composition of the syenites back to a hypothetical parental melt with 8 wt{\%}-10 wt{\%} MgO suggests derivation from a moderately enriched lithospheric upper mantle (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7055, ∈Nd = -4, $\delta$18O = 5‰, 206Pb/204Pb = 17.60, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.58, 208Pb/204Pb = 37.50). More evolved quartz syenites show virtually unchanged 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb ratios and ∈Nd values. The most distinctive feature of the quartz syenites is their higher $\delta$18O values up to 10.5‰. These features seem to indicate that, unlike most other Damaran igneous rocks, the syenites described here were entirely formed within the lithospheric mantle and were not modified by assimilation processes of basement and/or Damaran metasedimentary rocks. In order to account for the substantial variation in 0 isotopes, the most likely source for these rocks is a heterogeneous association of mantle rocks and subducted upper crustal material, most likely altered basaltic rocks from subducted ocean floor. Additionally, low temperature alteration may have affected the quartz syenites. In contrast, although coeval granites with A-type affinities are interpreted as fractionation products of the syenites, their distinctly more negative ∈Nd values ranging from -9 to -10 indicate that deep crustal assimilation processes of local Proterozoic basement rocks play an important role in the evolution of these granites.},

abstract = {Magma chamber dynamics at the phonolitic to basanitic Teide–Pico Viejo volcanic complex on Tenerife, Canary Islands, have been investigated using feldspar zonation and chemistry. Backscattered electron-image grey value profiles, obtained by electron microprobe and calibrated on anorthite content, allow the investigation of much better spatially resolved zonation profiles than quantitative point analysis alone.

On the basis of these zonation patterns and trace element analyses by electron microprobe, magma chamber processes such as magma recharge and mingling, as well as whole-chamber overturn events, can be identified and characterized in more detail. Samples from all investigated eruption centres contain feldspars, which have experienced growth in a deep reservoir, followed by ascent, resorption, and growth of mantles in more shallow levels in the crust just prior to eruption.

Two Pico Viejo samples exhibit feldspars with a characteristic drop in anorthite content, which is not accompanied by resorption. Trace element behaviour in these samples shows that cores and mantles have grown from the same magma reservoir: The conclusion from these data is that there occurred complete overturn events in layered magma chambers, presumably induced by cold plumes from the cupola layers. A mass balance calculation shows that the proportions of the layers are ∼ 75 wt.{\%} lower part and ∼ 25 wt.{\%} cupola layer.

Correlations between zonation patterns of single crystals in different rocks show that the Teide magma chambers are larger and chemically buffered compared with the smaller Pico Viejo system. Feldspars from Pico Viejo exhibit rather complex anorthite-profiles and more frequently display disturbances likely to be caused by arrival of new magma batches.},

abstract = {Extensive flows of the Columbia River Basalt (CRB) Group in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are dominantly inflated compound pahoehoe sheet lavas. Early studies recognized that CRB lavas are compound pahoehoe flows, with textures suggesting low flow velocities, but it was thought that the great thickness and extent of the major flows required very rapid emplacement as turbulent floods of lava over a period of days or weeks. However, small volume ({\textless} 1 km³) compound pahoehoe flows on Kilauea, Hawai'i, demonstrate that such flows can thicken by at least an order of magnitude through gradual inflation and the same mechanism has been proposed for larger (10–20 km3) pahoehoe flows in Iceland. The vertical distribution of vesicles and other morphologic features within CRB lava flows indicate that they grew similarly by inflation. Small pahoehoe lobes at the base and top of many CRB pahoehoe lava flows indicate emplacement in a gradual, piecemeal manner rather than as a single flood. We propose that each thick CRB sheet flow was active for months to years and that each group of flows produced by a single eruption (a flow field) was emplaced slowly over many years.},

@article{Maaloe1978,
abstract = {Long basaltic lava flows (over 100 km in length) require specific emplacement conditions to prevent the lava from freezing as it is transported to the flow front. The minimum dimensions of the lava transport systems (tubes, channels, or sheets) require that the flow have a volume greater than several cubic kilometers. Long lava flows are emplaced on slopes less than 10{\%} (∼5°) and the lava being transported must cool at a rate less than 0.5°C/km. We show that there are two modes by which thermally efficient, long distance lava transport can be achieved: (1) “rapid” emplacement in which the lava flows so quickly that it does not cool excessively despite large heat losses and (2) “insulated” emplacement in which heat loss is minimized. We here estimate cooling in the rapid mode using a modified version of a previously published thermal model for aa flows and find that, for a range of inputs appropriate for subaerial terrestrial condition, effusion rates of at least 3100 to 11000 m3/s, channel flow velocities in excess of 4–12 m/s, and minimum channel depths of 3–17 m are required for basaltic flows {\textgreater}100 km in length. For emplacement in the insulated mode, we construct a very simple heat balance model for roofed sheet flows which shows that extremely long sheet-fed flows are possible with velocities as low as 0.2–1.4 m/s, flow thickness of 6–23 m, and minimum effusion rates of the order of 50–7100 m3/s. Also, earlier work has suggested that tube-fed flows more than 100 km long can be produced at effusion rates as low as several tens of m3/s and with tube diameters of a few tens of meters. We argue that flows emplaced in the rapid mode should be morphologically similar to channel-fed aa flows while those emplaced in the insulated mode should be similar to tube-fed or sheet-like inflated pahoehoe flows. This leads to several field criteria for distinguishing these two modes of emplacement in ancient lava sequences. Additional constraints on the emplacement of long lava flows are expected from the continued study of the formation and evolution of lava channels, tubes, and sheets.},

abstract = {Triple oxygen isotopes within post-Marinoan barites have played an integral role in our understanding of Cryogenian glaciations. Reports of anomalous $\delta$O17 values within cap carbonate hosted barites however have remained restricted to South China and Mauritania. Here we extend the $\delta$O17 anomaly to northwest Canada with our new measurements of barites from the Ravensthroat cap dolostone with a minimum $\delta$O17 value of -0.75‰. For the first time we pair triple oxygen with multiple sulfur isotopic data as a tool to identify the key processes that controlled the post-Marinoan sulfur cycle. We argue using a dynamic 1-box model that the observed isotopic trends both in northwest Canada and South China can be explained through the interplay between sulfide weathering, microbial sulfur cycling and pyrite burial. An important outcome of this study is a new constraint placed on the size of the post-Marinoan sulfate reservoir (≈0.1{\%} modern), with a maximum concentration of less than 10{\%} modern. Through conservative estimates of sulfate fluxes from sulfide weathering and under a small initial sulfate reservoir, we suggest that observed isotopic trends are the product of a dynamic sulfur cycle that saw both the addition and removal of the $\delta$O17 anomaly over four to five turnovers of the post-Marinoan marine sulfate reservoir.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic longitudinal acoustic velocities in oxidized silicate liquids indicate that the pressure deriva- tive of the partial-molar volume of Fe203 is the same in iron-rich alkali-, alkaline earth- and natural silicate melt compositions at 1 bar. The dV/dP for multicom- ponent silicate liquids can be expressed as a linear com- bination of partial-molar constants plus a positive excess term for Na20-AI203 mixing. Partial-molar properties for FeO and Fe203 components allow extension of the empirical expression of Sack et al. (1980) to permit the calculation of Fe-redox equilibrium in a natural silicate liquid as a function of composition, temperature, fo2 and pressure; a more formal thermodynamic expression is presented in the Appendix. The predicted equilibrium fo2 of natural silicate melts, of fixed oxygen content, closely parallels that defined by the metastable assem- blage fayalite+magnetite+/b-quartz (FMQ), in pres- sure-temperature space. A silicate melt initially equili- brated at 3 GPa and FMQ, will remain within approxi- mately 0.5 loglo units of FMQ during its closed-system ascent. Thus, for magmas closed to oxygen, iron-redox equilibrium in crystal-poor pristine glassy lavas repre- sents an excellent probe of the relative oxidation state of their source regions. Introduction},

abstract = {We examine the extent to which nanoscale geometric substrate roughness influences the contact angle droplets establish on solid surfaces. Free-energy-based Monte Carlo simulation methods are used to compute contact angles and interfacial tensions of a model Lennard-Jones fluid on substrates with regular one-dimensional heterogeneities characterized by amplitudes and periodicities in the 2?25 nm range. We focus on a relatively strong surface that facilitates the formation of Wenzel droplets. Our results enable us to probe the validity of Wenzel?s model at these length scales. We find that the aforementioned model predicts the evolution of the contact angle with near-quantitative accuracy over a wide range of amplitudes for substrates with periodicities larger than approximately 20 fluid diameters, or 10 nm for an argon-like system. However, below this length scale the Wenzel model provides progressively poorer estimates of the contact angle as the periodicity of the substrate features decreases. At these relatively small length scales, the Wenzel model overestimates the influence of roughness. To complete our analysis, we introduce a means to overcome sampling difficulties that arise at intermediate densities during grand canonical simulation. Specifically, we describe a two-step process that enables us to access the free energy of a system containing a thick liquid film in contact with the substrate. The process involves high-temperature grand canonical simulation followed by temperature-expanded ensemble simulation at relatively high surface density.},

The 200 m volcanic succession evaluated in this study has features similar to those of other continental flood basalt provinces and consists of four volcanic units: a basal unit of laterally discontinuous flows with evidence for lava-sediment interactions, a mafic volcaniclastic deposit emplaced as a mass flow, a quartz-rich volcanic sandstone that records the re-establishment of small river channels, and a unit of thick, high-titanium tholeiitic sheet flows that mark the onset of the main phase of flood volcanism. The basal units show marked lateral thickness variations that imply the existence of paleotopography during their eruption and/or deposition. In addition, two newly discovered volcanic vent complexes within the Natkusiak succession preserve the products of explosive, vent-forming basaltic pyroclastic fall eruptions. Differences in major element geochemistry between the basal and upper basaltic flow units, in conjunction with the lithological characteristics of each volcanic unit, are used to correlate the units on a scale of over 100 km from the south of the Minto Inlier to the north.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Franklin large igneous province on Victoria Island, Canada, is characterized by continental flood basalts and a sill-dominated feeder system. Field relationships indicate that fault-guided transfer zones allowed magma to jump up-section to form higher-level intrusions. Where sills connect to dikes and magmas moved up-section, roof and wall rocks are characterized by wide and intense contact-metamorphic haloes, consistent with throughflow of magma. The geometric constraints suggest that conduits may have opened episodically and then closed when magma pressure waned. The episodic nature of conduit opening events can explain the pulsed ascent of crystal slurries, and may also play a role in the deposition of Ni-sulfides.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal zircon can be used to date fluid-infiltration events and water/rock interaction. At the Boggy Plain zoned pluton (BPZP), eastern Australia, hydrothermal zircon occurs with hydrothermal scheelite, molybdenite, thorite and rutile in incipiently altered aplite and monzogranite. The hydrothermal zircon is texturally distinct from magmatic zircon in the same rocks, occurring as murky-brown translucent 20–50 $\mu$m-thick mantles on magmatic cores and less commonly as individual crystals. The hydrothermal mantles are internally textureless in back-scatter electron and cathodoluminescence images whereas magmatic zircon is oscillatory zoned. The age of the hydrothermal zircon is indistinguishable from magmatic zircon, indicating precipitation from a fluid evolved from the magma during the final stages of crystallization. Despite indistinguishable U-Pb isotopic compositions, the trace-element compositions of the hydrothermal and magmatic zircon are distinct. Hydrothermal zircon is enriched in all measured trace-elements relative to magmatic zircon in the same rock, including V, Ti, Nb, Hf, Sc, Mn, U, Y, Th and the rare-earth elements (REE). Chondrite-normalized REE abundances form two distinct pattern groupings: type-1 (magmatic) patterns increase steeply from La to Lu and have Ce and Eu anomalies—these are patterns typical for unaltered magmatic zircon in continental crust rock types; type-2 (hydrothermal) patterns generally have higher abundances of the REE, flatter light-REE patterns [(Sm/La)N = 1.5–4.4 vs. 22–110 for magmatic zircon] and smaller Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* = 1.8–3.5 vs. 32–49 for magmatic zircon). Type-2 patterns have also been described for hydrothermally-altered zircon from the Gabel Hamradom granite, Egypt, and a granitic dyke from the Acasta Gneiss Complex, Canada. Hadean (∼4.5–4.0 Ga) zircon from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, have variable normalized REE patterns. In particular, the oldest piece of Earth—zircon crystal W74/2-36 (dated at 4.4 Ga)—contains both type-1 and type-2 patterns on a 50 $\mu$m scale, a phenomenon not yet reported for unaltered magmatic zircon. In the context of documented magmatic and hydrothermal zircon compositions from constrained samples from the BPZP and the literature, the type-2 patterns in crystal W74/2-36 and other Jack Hills Hadean (JHH) zircon are interpreted as hydrothermally-altered magmatic compositions. An alteration scenario, constrained by isotope and trace-element data, as well as $\alpha$-decay event calculations, involving fluid/zircon cation and oxygen isotope exchange within partially metamict zones and minor dissolution/reprecipitation, may have occurred episodically for some JHH zircon and at ∼4.27 Ga for zircon W74/2-36. Type-2 compositions in JHH zircon are interpreted to represent localized exchange with a light-REE-bearing, high $\delta$18O (∼6–10‰ or higher) fluid. Thus, a complex explanation involving “permanent” liquid water oceans, large-scale water/rock interaction and plate tectonics in the very early Archean is not necessary as the zircon textures and compositions are simply explained by exchange between partially metamict zircon and a low volume ephemeral fluid.},

abstract = {The global biosphere is commonly assumed to have been less productive before the rise of complex eukaryotic ecosystems than it is today1. However, direct evidence for this assertion is lacking. Here we present triple oxygen isotope measurements (∆17O) from sedimentary sulfates from the Sibley basin (Ontario, Canada) dated to about 1.4 billion years ago, which provide evidence for a less productive biosphere in the middle of the Proterozoic eon. We report what are, to our knowledge, the most-negative ∆17O values (down to −0.88‰) observed in sulfates, except for those from the terminal Cryogenian period2. This observation demonstrates that the mid-Proterozoic atmosphere was distinct from what persisted over approximately the past 0.5 billion years, directly reflecting a unique interplay among the atmospheric partial pressures of CO2 and O2 and the photosynthetic O2 flux at this time3. Oxygenic gross primary productivity is stoichiometrically related to the photosynthetic O2 flux to the atmosphere. Under current estimates of mid-Proterozoic atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (2–30 times that of pre-anthropogenic levels), our modelling indicates that gross primary productivity was between about 6{\%} and 41{\%} of pre-anthropogenic levels if atmospheric O2 was between 0.1–1{\%} or 1–10{\%} of pre-anthropogenic levels, respectively. When compared to estimates of Archaean4–6 and Phanerozoic primary production7, these model solutions show that an increasingly more productive biosphere accompanied the broad secular pattern of increasing atmospheric O2 over geologic time8.},

abstract = {Although it is well known that A-type granites are enriched in the rare earth elements (REE) and other high field strength elements (HFSE), the magmatic processes that concentrate these elements are still poorly understood. The 1.24 Ga Strange Lake pluton in northern Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador provides an extraordinary example of hyper-enrichment in the REE, Zr, and Nb in a peralkaline A-type granite. The pluton consists of two hypersolvus granite units (southern and northern) and a transsolvus granite, all of which contain perthitic alkali feldspar as the earliest major mineral; the transsolvus granite also contains separate albite and microcline crystals. Arfvedsonite, a sodic amphibole, occurs exclusively as phenocrysts in the transsolvus granite, whereas in the hypersolvus granite it is present as a late, interstitial phase. The primary HFSE minerals are zircon, monazite-(Ce), gagarinite-(Ce) and the pyrochlore group minerals. Magma evolution was monitored by the alumina content in the bulk rock, which decreases from the southern to the northern hypersolvus granite and is lowest in the transsolvus granite. Alkalinity indices and bulk Si, Fe, Rb, REE, Zr, Nb concentrations show the opposite trend. Alkali feldspar compositions mirror the trend shown by the bulk rock, i.e., decreasing Al contents are accompanied by increasing Si, Fe3+, REE, Zr and Nb contents. The major driving forces for the evolution of the hypersolvus magma prior to emplacement were the early separation of a fluoride melt from the silicate melt and the crystallization of alkali feldspar and HFSE-rich phases (zircon, monazite-(Ce), pyrochlore group). An alkali feldspar-rich crystal-mush containing LREE-fluoride melt droplets was emplaced as the least evolved southern hypersolvus granite. Massive fractionation of alkali feldspar led to a sharp increase in ƒH2O and F−activity in the magma chamber that triggered the crystallization of arfvedsonite and was followed by emplacement of the northern hypersolvus granite, which contained a higher proportion of LREE-fluoride melt droplets. Further evolution in the magma chamber led to a transition from a miaskitic to an agpaitic composition. The transsolvus granite was intruded in the form of a low viscosity crystal mush of alkali feldspar, quartz, arfvedsonite (after appreciable crystallization of arfvedsonite) and LREE-fluoride melt droplets. Upon emplacement, arfvedsonite (and gagarinite-(Ce)) crystals segregated as cumulates in response to a combination of flow differentiation and gravity settling. The immiscible fluoride melt accumulated in a volatile-rich residual silicate magma, which migrated to the top of the pluton where it formed the F-REE-rich cores of highly mineralized pegmatites.},

abstract = {Continental intraplate volcanoes, such as Erebus volcano, Antarctica, are associated with extensional tectonics, mantle upwelling and high heat flow. Typically, erupted magmas are alkaline and rich in volatiles (especially CO2), inherited from low degrees of partial melting of mantle sources. We examine the degassing of the magmatic system at Erebus volcano using melt inclusion data and high temporal resolution open-path Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements of gas emissions from the active lava lake. Remarkably different gas signatures are associated with passive and explosive gas emissions, representative of volatile contents and redox conditions that reveal contrasting shallow and deep degassing sources. We show that this unexpected degassing signature provides a unique probe for magma differentiation and transfer of CO2-rich oxidised fluids from the mantle to the surface, and evaluate how these processes operate in time and space. Extensive crystallisation driven by CO2 fluxing is responsible for isobaric fractionation of parental basanite magmas close to their source depth. Magma deeper than 4{\&}{\#}xa0;kbar equilibrates under vapour-buffered conditions. At shallower depths, CO2-rich fluids accumulate and are then released either via convection-driven, open-system gas loss or as closed-system slugs that ascend and result in Strombolian eruptions in the lava lake. The open-system gases have a reduced state (below the QFM buffer) whereas the closed-system gases preserve their deep oxidised signatures (close to the NNO buffer).},

On Earth the dikes are exposed by erosion, while on Venus and Mars their presence is mainly inferred from associated volcanic morphology and surface deformation. The apparent absence of plate tectonics in the geologic record of Venus and Mars means that the observed population of swarms remains geometrically intact, while on Earth plate tectonics has fragmented swarms. About 30 giant radiating swarms have so far been identified on Earth, but with further study the number is expected to rise and may eventually coincide with the hundreds of mantle plume head events now being proposed. On Venus, at least 118 radiating swarms are distributed across the planet, and new high resolution mapping is revealing additional swarms. On Mars, up to 16 giant dike swarms are observed, most associated with the Tharsis region.},

abstract = {Carbonatites found in strongly alkaline intra-plate petrographic volcanic provinces are associated with olivine-poor nephelinites and with phonolites. Olivine-rich nephelinites occur in basanitic and alkali basalt provinces, normally without carbonatites. These igneous provinces are marked by epeirogenic crustal uplift.Nephelinites, ijolites and carbonatites form discrete magmatic events within individual complexes and correspond to the silicate-carbonate conjugate immiscible liquids observed in the laboratory. Carbonate liquids of variable alkali content can separate from both nephelinitic and phonolitic liquids. The silicate liquids give rise to pyroxenites, ijolites, nepheline syenites and nephelinitic pyroclast-rich strato-volcanoes. The carbonate liquids lose alkalis and fractionate to s{\"{o}}vite, alvikite and ferrocarbonatite, each with increasing incompatible-element content. Further fractionation of carbonatite magma can produce mineralizing fluids rich in rare-earth elements, F, Ba, U and Th. Dolomite carbonatite forms only in the deeper parts of carbonatitic complexes, perhaps at depths greater than 2 km. Explosive carbonatite volcanism can occur giving widespread carbonate tuffs, rarely with lavas.Fenitization characterizes ijolite-carbonatite intrusive complexes. Syenitic fenites containing alkali feldspars, sometimes perthitic, are formed as aureoles 500 m wide around ijolites in granitic terranes, with nepheline syenite commonly formed as a contact-reaction rock. The feldspar-rich syneitic fenite aureoles which develop around the early carbonatites usually contain pure orthoclase or pure albite.},

abstract = {The Olkaria complex is a recent, peralkaline rhyolite field in the Kenya Rift Valley close to the axial region of the Kenya Dome. U–Th disequilibrium was measured by $\alpha$-spectrometry in whole rocks and mineral separates from seven geographically and compositionally distinct groups (centres) of rhyolites. Forty-three whole-rock samples show variable Th/U ratios (2.8–6.2) and a large range of (238U/232Th) ratios (0.5–1.1); 79{\%} of the rhyolites show U excess. Rocks from some centres plot entirely to the left or right of the equiline, whereas some centres straddle it. Internal isochrons give U–Th ages of between 14.6+2.2−2.1 and 36.2+2.6−2.6 ka (2$\sigma$) respectively for the Gorge Farm centre and 50.5+7.9−7.3ka for the Broad Acres centre. These ages, interpreted as phenocryst crystallization ages, are older than eruption ages by 103–104 yr. The youngest centre displays (226Ra/230Th) {\textgreater} 1, indicating that Ra–Th fractionation has taken place {\textless}8000 yr bp. There is a positive correlation between (226Ra/230Th) and (238U/230Th) ratios for rocks of the youngest centre, indicating that the Ra enrichment and the U enrichment probably occurred during the same event. Closed-system fractionation of observed mineral phases cannot alone explain the U-series disequilibria although it may have contributed to other compositional features of the rhyolites. The degree of U enrichment is related to major and trace element variations in the rhyolites as a whole, in that there is a correlation with peralkalinity and thus with incompatible trace element abundances, in particular Nb, Rb and Zr. There is a good correlation between (238U/230Th) and pre-eruptive F contents but not pre-eruptive H2O contents, consistent with previous suggestions that the rhyolites formed by halogen-fluxed melting of the crust. Compositional variations between groups of rhyolites are related to heterogeneity of the crustal source rocks, degree of partial melting(and thus residual mineralogy) and the composition and abundance of metasomatic fluids.},

For carbon, the inferred initial predegassing contents vary greatly, from 660 to 14,700 ppmCO2 and from 1400 to 57,600 ppmCO2 for samples at 14° N and 34° N respectively. Measured Nb-contents range from 4.5 to 29.6 ppm show both good agreement with previously published data and positive correlations with reconstructed initial CO2-contents. The mean CO2/Nb range from ∼ 570 to ∼ 730 at 14° N and 34° N respectively.

CO2 and Nb data for the two undegassed samples available so far (i.e. the popping rock of the present study and the basaltic glasses from the Siqueiros transform fault from the study of Saal et al., 2002) show significant variations in CO2/Nb over a factor of 2 and thus questions the constant CO2/Nb previously emphasised for these two samples, this view being supported by CO2/Nb-ratios of samples whose initial C-contents were reconstructed.

For incompatible elements such as Ce, K and including water, a comparison of the geochemical characteristics of transform fault basaltic magmatism with other MORB systems shows magma transform fault magmatism to be unrepresentative of mantle compositions. Assuming a more appropriate average MORB CO2/Nb-ratio of ∼ 530 and a mean MORB Nb-content of 3.31 − 1.8 + 3.99 , we computed a mantle carbon flux of 2.3 − 1.3 + 2.7 × 1012 mol/yr, a value actually consistent with that derived from C/3He systematics.},

abstract = {Zircons from a suite of basic to acidic calcalkaline igneous rocks from the southern Adamello batholith (S AB), Southern Alps, N Italy, display complex U−Pb isotopic patterns which are mainly due to the presence of variable amounts of isotopically heterogeneous, inherited radiogenic Pb, and to minor postmagmatic loss of Pb. Inherited Pb is mainly composed of 1) a ∼ 1100 Ma Pb component located in zircons devoid of visible cores and 2) a ∼ 450 Ma component associated with conspicuous bubble-rich turbid cores. In concordia representation the data points conform to lower intercept ages of ∼ 40 Ma. A linear fit of three samples devoid of visible cores from the granodiorite defines an intrusion age of ∼ 39.3 Ma. U−Pb systematics of zircon (in particular U content) and crystal morphology are clearly related. Zircons of type G1, which form relatively late in the zircon crystallization sequence, consistently show the highest U contents in each zircon population. These late zircons, however, are not devoid of inherited radiogenic lead. In a population from a granodiorite, cores are randomly distributed throughout the morphological spectrum. The presence of old inherited zircon components in all investigated samples furnishes proof for involvement of crustal material in the genesis of the S AB rocks. Samples characterized by crustal ɛNd and ɛSr values usually show enhanced zircon inheritance. Inheritance varies with differentiation and reaches a maximum for intermediate to acidic members; these compositions show the highest Zr saturation temperatures calculated for the rock spectrum studied. Textural relations between zircon and major phases indicate that the magmas of the leucocratic rocks were saturated with Zr at an early stage of crystallization. On the other hand, Zr solubilities and textural relations consistently show, that melts of basic to intermediate rocks were not saturated with Zr. Extension of the Zr solubility model to mineral/melt mixtures of tonalitic bulk composition demonstrates that Zr solubility in the residual melt is drastically reduced by crystallization of plagioclase and amphibole. Survival of xenocrystic zircons in the mafic to intermediate rocks of the S AB can best be explained in terms of dissolution kinetics. Since temperature and H2O content of these Zr-undersaturated melts were favourable for relatively rapid zircon dissolution, inherited zircons (in particular trace-element rich unstable cores) cannot have been exposed to such conditions over extended time periods. Therefore, the tonalitic or more basic magmas of the S AB cannot have been derived from crustal sources by slow processes such as burial metamorphism.},

abstract = {The Mesoproterozoic Kunene Intrusive Complex (Angola/Namibia), one of the largest massif-type anorthosite complexes of the world, intruded high-grade metamorphic Paleoproterozoic rocks at the southern margin of the Congo Craton. The geochemical characteristics of two successively emplaced anorthosite varieties provide insight into the source and evolution of melts parental to massif-type anorthosites. The older white anorthosite suite consists of pyroxene-bearing anorthosite and leucogabbronorite and is characterized by initial isotopic compositions of87Sr/86Sr: 0.7031-0.7043, e{\{}open{\}}Nd: +2.1 to -3.1 and206Pb/204Pb: 16.21-17.09. Our data demonstrate that the mantle-derived parental melt of the white anorthosite suite was subject to crustal contamination during the early stages of evolution, producing evolved magma whose isotope and trace element composition shows a distinct crustal influence. In contrast, the olivine-bearing anorthosite and leucotroctolite of the younger dark anorthosite suite show much less crustal influence. These rocks represent the most primitive unit in the Kunene Intrusive Complex and yield initial87Sr/86Sr: 0.7028-0.7036, e{\{}open{\}}Nd: +6.4 to +0.8 and206Pb/204Pb: 16.18-16.94.

Whilst the majority of rock- dating studies involving zircon have utilized the UPb and ThPb decay schemes, as discussed in previous chapters, an increasing number of investigations are targeting the complementary age information available in the lesser known decay schemes. This chapter reviews the history of appli- cation of the LuHf and SmNd isotope systems in zircon and, in its conclusions, speculates on potential future use of the LaCe system.},

abstract = {Mantle xenoliths have been discovered in a Cretaceous nephelinite plug in the Damara Belt of NW Namibia, providing a new window into the thermal and compositional structure of the lithospheric mantle that separates the Congo and Kaapvaal cratons of southern Africa. The xenoliths range in size from 1.5 to 5 cm, and comprise lherzolite and harzburgite (± spinel), with predominantly granuloblastic textures. Two groups of spinel peridotites are identified on the basis of mineral chemistry. The first group has refractory compositions with Mg-number progressively increasing from olivine (91.3–92.0), through orthopyroxene (91.8–92.5) to clinopyroxene (93.7–94.3), low Al2O3 (2.4–2.9 wt{\%}), Na2O (0.25–0.63 wt{\%}) and TiO2 ({\textless}0.05 wt{\%}) contents in clinopyroxene, and Cr-rich spinels (Cr/(Cr+Al)=0.34–0.47). The second group has less refractory mineral compositions with Mg-number of 90–91 for all three silicate phases, clinopyroxene with elevated Al2O3 (c. 6.5 wt{\%}), Na2O (c. 1.7 wt{\%}) and TiO2 (c. 0.45 wt{\%}) contents, and Al-rich spinels (Cr/(Cr+Al)=0.11). In terms of mineral chemistry and textures, both groups of xenoliths can be classified as Type I peridotites and, unlike spinel lherzolites from the Okenyenya complex 100 km to the NE, they show no signs of modal metasomatism. Calculated oxygen fugacities indicate equilibration of the xenoliths at -0.29 to 1.0 log units above fayalite–magnetite–quartz (FMQ), which for the fertile peridotites places them among the most oxidized samples recorded from continental settings. Temperatures of equilibration range from 871 to 1236 °C for TBKN and from 844 to 1128 °C for TCa-in-opx. No significant difference in temperature was found between the two groups of lherzolites. Pressures calculated from the Ca content of olivine in equilibrium with clinopyroxene are in the range 1.4–2.0 GPa, with the fertile lherzolites originating at deeper levels than the refractory group. A local geotherm substantially hotter (c. 90 mW m-2) than that beneath the contemporaneous Gibeon kimberlites (c. 45 mW m-2) is indicated and probably relates to tectonothermal events associated with local and regional Cretaceous magmatism. The inferred mantle stratigraphy suggests the juxtapositioning of relatively fertile Phanerozoic-type mantle beneath refractory peridotite similar to that of Proterozoic lithosphere sampled by the Gibeon kimberlites 300 km to the SE. This may have occurred during formation of the Damara Belt and be related genetically to the linear belt of mafic volcanic rocks emplaced during late Proterozoic time and preserved today as the Matchless amphibolite},

abstract = {The structure and volcanic stratigraphy of the Pico Teide–Pico Viejo (PT–PV) formation, deriving from the basanite–phonolite stratovolcanoes PT and PV, and numerous flank vent systems, are documented in detail based on new field and photogeologic mapping, geomorphologic analysis, borehole data, and petrological and geochemical findings. Results provide insight into the structure and evolution of the PT–PV magma system, and the long-term, cyclic evolution of Tenerife's post-shield volcanic complex. The PT–PV formation comprises products of central volcanism, mainly emplaced into the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera (LCC), and contemporaneous products from adjacent rifts. PT–PV central volcanic products become more differentiated up-section with felsic lavas dominating the recent output of the system. This is attributed to the evolution of a shallow magma reservoir beneath PT that was emplaced early in the PT–PV cycle on the intra-caldera segment of Tenerife's post-shield rift system. The rift axis has been the focus of PT–PV intrusive and eruptive activity, and has controlled the location of the stratocones. The current geometry of the rifts reflects a major structural reorganisation defining the start of the PT–PV cycle at ∼0.18 Ma, namely the truncation of the north side of the LCC/LCE by the giant Icod landslide. The internal stratigraphy of the PT–PV formation suggests that PT developed early, with PV developing as a satellite vent. Activity has since alternated between PT and PV due to episodes of vent blockage or chamber sealing. These processes have allowed significant volumes of phonolitic magmas to develop and accumulate within the PT chamber, which have vented through radial dike systems during tumescence episodes and from the rift system, which has permitted lateral magma transport. The PT–PV magma system is a potentially hazardous source of future, felsic eruptive activity on Tenerife.},

abstract = {The two drill holes, which penetrated sub-horizontal rare earth element (REE) ore units at the Nechalacho REE in the Proterozoic Thor Lake syenite, Canada, were studied in order to clarify the enrichment mechanism of the high-field-strength elements (HFSE: Zr, Nb and REE). The REE ore units occur in the albitized and potassic altered miaskitic syenite. Zircon is the most common REE mineral in the REE ore units, and is divided into five types as follows: Type-1 zircon occurs as discrete grains in phlogopite, and has a chemical character similar to igneous zircon. Type-2 zircon consists of a porous HREE-rich core and LREE–Nb–F-rich rim. Enrichment of F in the rim of type-2 zircon suggests that F was related to the enrichment of HFSE. The core of type-2 zircon is regarded to be magmatic and the rim to be hydrothermal in origin. Type-3 zircon is characterized by euhedral to anhedral crystals, which occur in a complex intergrowth with REE fluorocarbonates. Type-3 zircon has high REE, Nb and F contents. Type-4 zircon consists of porous-core and -rim, but their chemical compositions are similar to each other. This zircon is a subhedral crystal rimmed by fergusonite. Type-5 zircon is characterized by smaller, porous and subhedral to anhedral crystals. The interstices between small zircon grains are filled by fergusonite. Type-4 and type-5 zircon grains have low REE, Nb and F contents. Type-1 zircon is only included in one unit, which is less hydrothermally altered and mineralized. Type-2 and type-3 zircon grains mainly occur in the shallow units, while those of type-4 and type-5 are found in the deep units. The deep units have high HFSE contents and strongly altered mineral textures (type-4 and type-5) compared to the shallow units. Occurrences of these five types of zircon are different according to the depth and degree of the hydrothermal alteration by solutions rich in F and CO3, which permit a model for the evolution of the zircon crystallization in the Nechalacho REE deposit as follows: (i) type-1 (discrete magmatic zircon) is formed in miaskitic syenite. (ii) LREE–Nb–F-rich hydrothermal zircon formed around HREE-rich magmatic zircon (type-2). (iii) type-3 zircon crystallized through the F and CO3-rich hydrothermal alteration of type-2 zircon which formed the complex intergrowth with REE fluorocarbonates; (iv) the CO3-rich hydrothermal fluid corroded type-3, forming REE–Nb-poor zircon (type-4). Niobium and REE were no longer stable in the zircon structure and crystallized as fergusonite around the REE–Nb-leached zircon (type-4); (v) type-5 zircon is formed by the more CO3-rich hydrothermal alteration of type-4 zircon, suggested by the fact that type-4 and type-5 zircon grains are often included in ankerite. Type-3 to type-5 zircon grains at the Nechalacho REE deposit were continuously formed by leaching and/or dissolution of type-2 zircon in the presence of F- and/or CO3-rich hydrothermal fluid. These mineral associations indicate that three representative hydrothermal stages were present and related to HFSE enrichment in the Nechalacho REE deposit: (i) F-rich hydrothermal stage caused the crystallization of REE–Nb-rich zircon (type-2 rim and type-3), with abundant formation of phlogopite and fluorite; (ii) F- and CO3-rich hydrothermal stage led to the replacement of a part of REE–Nb–F-rich zircon by REE fluorocarbonate; and (iii) CO3-rich hydrothermal stage resulted in crystallization of the REE–Nb–F-poor zircon and fergusonite, with ankerite. REE and Nb in hydrothermal fluid at the Nechalacho REE deposit were finally concentrated into fergusonite by way of REE–Nb–F-rich zircon in the hydrothermally altered units.},

abstract = {Basaltic lavas, forming thick offshore seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS) and onshore igneous provinces around the North Atlantic margins, represent melting of anomalously hot mantle in the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. Some of these lavas are chemically and isotopically indistinguishable from recent Icelandic basalt, but others more closely resemble basalt erupted at normal segments of mid-ocean ridges (N-MORB). In this paper we show that Icelandic basalt and N-MORB define parallel tight arrays on a plot of log(Nb/Y) against log(Zr/Y), with N-MORB relatively deficient in Nb. Deficiency or excess of Nb, relative to the lower bound of the Iceland array, may be expressed as ANb = 1.74 + log(Nb/Y) -1.92 log(Zr/Y) such that Icelandic basalt has ANb {\textgreater} 0 and N-MORB has ANb {\textless} 0. ANb is a fundamental source characteristic and is insensitive to the effects of variable degrees of mantle melting, source depletion through melt extraction, crustal contamination of the magmas, or subsequent alteration. We use new and published Nb, Zr and Y data to identify the mantle sources for Palaeocene and Eocene basaltic lavas erupted around the Atlantic margins in order to deduce the thermal and compositional structure of the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. The results show that the head of the plume was zoned, with an axial zone of Icelandic mantle surrounded by a thick outer shell of anomalously hot but compositionally normal N-MORB-source mantle. The zoning is very similar in scale and character to that seen today along the Reykjanes Ridge and is difficult to reconcile with the initiation of rifting and SDRS formation through the impact of a large plume head originating solely from the lower mantle. The thick outer shell of hot, depleted upper mantle, which formed more than half the volume of the plume head, suggests that at least part of the plume originated in the thermal boundary layer at the base of the upper mantle. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A peculiar characteristic of the paroxysmal sequence that occurred on March 16, 2013 at the New South East Crater of Mt. Etna volcano (eastern Sicily, Italy) was the eruption of siliceous crustal xenoliths representative of the sedimentary basement beneath the volcanic edifice. These xenoliths are quartzites that occur as subspherical bombs enclosed in a thin trachybasaltic lava envelope. At the quartzite-magma interface a reaction corona develops due to the interaction between the Etnean trachybasaltic magma and the partially melted quartzite. Three distinct domains are observed: (i) the trachybasaltic lava itself (Zone 1), including Al-rich clinopyroxene phenocrysts dispersed in a matrix glass, (ii) the hybrid melt (Zone 2), developing at the quartzite-magma interface and feeding the growth of newly-formed Al-poor clinopyroxenes, and (iii) the partially melted quartzite (Zone 3), producing abundant siliceous melt. These features makes it possible to quantify the effect of magma contamination by siliceous crust in terms of clinopyroxene-melt element partitioning. Major and trace element partition coefficients have been calculated using the compositions of clinopyroxene rims and glasses next to the crystal surface. Zone 1 and Zone 2 partition coefficients correspond to, respectively, the chemical analyses of Al-rich phenocrysts and matrix glasses, and the chemical analyses of newly-formed Al-poor crystals and hybrid glasses. For clinopyroxenes from both the hybrid layer and the lava flow expected relationships are observed between the partition coefficient, the valence of the element, and the ionic radius. However, with respect to Zone 1 partition coefficients, values of Zone 2 partition coefficients show a net decrease for transition metals (TE), high-field strength elements (HFSE) and rare earth elements including yttrium (REE + Y), and an increase for large ion lithophile elements (LILE). This variation is associated with coupled substitutions on the M1, M2 and T sites of the type M1(Al, Fe3 +) + TAl = M2(Mg, Fe2 +) + TSi. The different incorporation of trace elements into clinopyroxenes of hybrid origin is controlled by cation substitution reactions reflecting local charge-balance requirements. According to the lattice strain theory, simultaneous cation exchanges across the M1, M2, and T sites have profound effects on REE + Y and HFSE partitioning. Conversely, both temperature and melt composition have only a minor effect when the thermal path of magma is restricted to {\~{}} 70 °C and the value of non-bridging oxygens per tetrahedral cations (NBO/T) shifts moderately from 0.31 to 0.43. As a consequence, Zone 2 partition coefficients for REE + Y and HFSE diverge significantly from those derived for Zone 1, accounting for limited cation incorporation into the newly-formed clinopyroxenes at the quartzite-magma interface.},

abstract = {Large areas of central Asia and mainland China have been affected by intraplate anorogenic magmatism, linked to mantle activity from the Palaeoproterozoic to present day. This magmatism is manifested by layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions, flood basalts, bimodal volcanic rocks, dyke swarms, I- and A-type granitoids, alkaline complexes, carbonatites and kimberlites. In this paper we discuss a selection of these thermal events, namely East Asia Mesozoic-Cenozoic, Siberian Traps, Emeishan, Tarim (Bachu), Yakutsk and South China. Mineral systems that are associated with the Asian intraplate magmatic events include Ni-Cu-PGE in mafic-ultramafic intrusions, porphyry Cu-Mo and skarn deposits, polymetallic veins and auriferous lode deposits generally hosted in granitoids, rare earths and rare metals in alkaline complexes and diamondiferous kimberlites. The anorogenic intraplate igneous rocks originate from mantle sources or mixed mantle and crustal sources and are related, directly or indirectly, to deep mantle plumes or to asthenospheric upwellings that occur in response to lower crust and subcontinental lithosphere delamination linked to collision and subduction processes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Continental breakup and the transition to seafloor spreading is characterized by extensional faulting, thinning of the lithosphere and, at magmatic margins, voluminous intrusive and extrusive magmatism. It is difficult to discriminate between different mechanisms of extension and magmatism at ancient continental margins because the continent–ocean transition is buried beneath thick layers of volcanic and sedimentary rocks and the tectonic activity that characterized breakup has ceased. Instead, the timing of these mechanisms is inferred from theoretical models or from the geological record preserved at the fully developed, ancient rifted margins. Ongoing rifting in Ethiopia offers a unique opportunity to address these problems because it exposes subaerially the transition between continental rifting towards the south and seafloor spreading further northward. Here we synthesize constraints on the spatial and temporal evolution of magmatism and extension in Ethiopia. We show that although intrusion of magma maintains crustal thickness during the early stages of the continent–ocean transition, subsidence of the margin below sea level, and eruption of voluminous basalt flows, is initiated by late-stage thinning of the heavily intruded, weakened plate just before the onset of seafloor spreading. We thus conclude that faulting, stretching and magma intrusion are each important, but at different times during breakup.},

abstract = {The continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) is a small-volumed (ca. 2.5{\%} of the total mantle), chemically distinct mantle reservoir that has been suggested to play a role in the source of continental and oceanic magmatism. It is our most easily identifiable reservoir for preserving chemical heterogeneity in the mantle. Petrological and geophysical constraints indicate that the maximum depth of the CLM is ca. 250 km. There is a clear secular variation of CLM composition, such that CLM formed in the last 2 Gyr is less depleted and therefore less dynamically stable than ancient CLM formed in the Archean. We present new trace-element data for kimberlite-hosted lithospheric peridotites and metasomites. These data, combined with other data for spinel peridotites from non-cratonic regions, show that neither hydrous nor anhydrous lithospheric mantle xenoliths make suitable sources for continental or oceanic basalts. Addition of a hydrous phase, either amphibole or phlogopite, to depleted peridotite results in positive Nb and Ti anomalies that are the opposite of those predicted for some flood-basalt sources on the basis of their trace-element abundances. Overall, the Sr and Nd isotopic composition of cratonic and non-cratonic CLM is close to bulk Earth, with cratonic CLM showing small numbers of extreme compositions. Thus, while the CLM is certainly ancient in many locations, its average composition is not significantly 'enriched' over primitive upper mantle, in terms of either radiogenic isotopes or trace elements. These characteristics, plus a change in lithospheric chemistry with depth, indicate that the elemental and isotopic composition of lithospheric mantle likely to be re-incorporated into convecting mantle via delamination/thermal erosion processes is probably not very distinct from that of the convecting mantle. These observations lead us to question the requirement for CLM participation in the source of oceanic magmas and to promote consideration of a mantle that is chemically heterogeneous on all scales. Hf and Nd isotope compositions identify a distinctive source component in deeply derived alkaline volcanics associated with continents. This component cannot be constrained to the CLM but may originate from a deeper reservoir of ancient, subducted oceanic crust stored in the mantle.},

abstract = {The Lapa gold deposit contains reserves of 2.4 Mt at 6.5 g/t Au and is one of the few deposits located directly within the Cadillac–Larder Lake Fault Zone (CLLFZ), a first-order crustal-scale fault that separates the Archean Abitibi Subprovince from the Pontiac Subprovince to the south. Gold mineralization is predominantly hosted in highly strained and altered, upper greenschist–lower amphibolite facies mafic to ultramafic rocks of the Pich{\'{e}} Group. Auriferous ore zones consist of finely disseminated auriferous arsenopyrite–pyrrhotite ± pyrite and native gold disseminated in biotite- and carbonate-altered wall rocks. Native gold, which is also present in quartz ± dolomite–calcite veinlets, is locally associated with Sb-bearing minerals, especially at depth ≤1 km from surface where the deposit is characterized by a Au–Sb–As association. At vertical depth greater than 1 km, gold is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite (Au–As association). The mineralogy and paragenesis of the Lapa deposit metamorphosed ore and alteration assemblages record the superposition of three metamorphic episodes (M1, M2, and M3) and three gold mineralizing events. Spatial association between biotitized wall rocks and auriferous arsenopyrite indicates that arsenopyrite precipitation is concomitant with potassic alteration. The predominant Au–As association recognized across the deposit is related to gold in solid solution in arsenopyrite as part of a pre-M2 low-grade auriferous hydrothermal event. However, the occurrence of hornblende + oligoclase porphyroblasts overprinting the biotite alteration, and the presence of porous clusters and porphyroblasts of arsenopyrite with native gold and pyrrhotite indicate an auriferous metasomatic event associated with peak M2 prograde metamorphism. Late retrograde metamorphism (M3) overprints the hornblende–oligoclase M2 assemblage within the host rocks proximal to ore by an actinolite–albite assemblage by precipitation of free gold and Sb–sulfosalts at lower P–T. The complex relationships between ore, structural features, and metamorphic assemblages at Lapa are related to the tectonometamorphic evolution of the Cadillac–Larder Lake Fault Zone at different times and crustal levels, and varying heat and fluid flow regimes. The Lapa deposit demonstrates that early, low-grade gold mineralization within the Cadillac–Larder Lake Fault Zone has benefited from late gold enrichment(s) during prograde and retrograde metamorphism, suggesting that multi-stage processes may be important to form gold-rich orogenic deposits in first order crustal-scale structures.},

abstract = {Groundwater recharge at Mt. Hood, Oregon, is dominated by spring snow melt which provides a natural large-amplitude and narrow-width pore-fluid pressure signal. Time delays between this seasonal groundwater recharge and seismicity triggered by groundwater recharge can thus be used to estimate large-scale hydraulic diffusivities and the state of stress in the crust. We approximate seasonal variations in groundwater recharge with discharge in runoff-dominated streams at high elevations. We interpolate the time series of number of earthquakes, N, seismic moment, Mo, and stream discharge, Q, and determine cross-correlation coefficients at equivalent frequency bands between Q and both N and Mo. We find statistically significant correlation coefficients at a mean time lag of about 151 days. This time lag and a mean earthquake depth of about 4.5 km are used in the solution to the pressure diffusion equation, under periodic (1 year) boundary conditions, to estimate a hydraulic diffusivity of $\kappa$ ≈ 10-1m2/s, a hydraulic conductivity of about Kh≈ 10-7m/s, and a permeability of about k ≈ 10-15m2. Periodic boundary conditions also allow us to determine a critical pore-fluid pressure fraction, P′/P0≈ 0.1, of the applied near-surface pore-fluid pressure perturbation, P0≈ 0.1 MPa, that has to be reached at the mean earthquake depth to cause hydroseismicity. The low magnitude of P′ ≈ 0.01 MPa is consistent with other studies that propose 0.01 ≤ P′ ≤ 0.1 MPa and suggests that the state of stress in the crust near Mt. Hood could be near critical for failure. Therefore, we conclude that, while earthquakes occur throughout the year at Mt. Hood, elevated seismicity levels along pre-existing faults south of Mt. Hood during summer months are hydrologically induced by a reduction in effective stress. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geochemically, the large family of alkaline plutonic rocks (both Qtz-undersaturated and -oversaturated compositions) can be subdivided into metaluminous [(Na2O + K2O) {\textless} Al2O3] and peralkaline [(Na2O + K2O) {\textgreater} Al2O3] types. In this paper, we discuss two important aspects of the mineralogical evolution of such rocks. With respect to their Fe–Mg phases, a major mineralogical transition observed is the precipitation of arfvedsonite or aegirine instead of fayalite or magnetite (± ilmenite). The relative stability of these phases is controlled by oxygen fugacity and Na activity in the crystallizing melts. If Na activity in the melt is high enough, arfvedsonite + aegirine form a common assemblage in peralkaline rocks under both reduced and oxidized conditions. Major mineralogical differences within this rock group exist with respect to their high field strength element (HFSE)-rich minerals: most syenitic rocks, known as miaskites, contain zircon, titanite or ilmenite as HFSE-rich minerals, whereas in agpaites complex Na–K–Ca–(Ti, Zr) silicates incorporate the HFSE. Similarly, only a small group of peralkaline granites are found to lack zircon, titanite or ilmenite but instead contain Na–K–Ca–(Ti, Zr) silicates. Here, we present a detailed phase petrological analysis of the chemical parameters (µNa2O, µCaO, µK2O) that influence the transition from miaskitic to agpaitic rocks. Based on the occurrence of Ti and Zr minerals, several transitional mineral assemblages are identified and two major evolution trends for agpaites are distinguished: a high-Ca trend, which is exemplified by the alkaline rocks of the Kola Province, Russia, and a Ca-depletion trend, which is displayed by the alkaline rocks of the Gardar Province, South Greenland. Both trends show significant Na-enrichment during magmatic evolution. High-Ca agpaites evolve from nephelinitic parental melts that did not crystallize large amounts of plagioclase. In contrast, agpaites showing Ca-depletion originate by extensive fractionation of plagioclase from basaltic parental melts. In some peralkaline granites evolutionary trends are observed that culminate in agpaite-like HFSE-mineral associations in the most evolved rocks.},

abstract = {Variation of Nernst partition coefficients (D) between olivine and silicate melts cannot be neglected when modeling partial melting and fractional crystallization. Published natural and experimental olivine/liquidD data were examined for covariation with pressure, temperature, olivine forsterite content, and melt SiO2, H2O, MgO and MgO/MgO + FeOtotal. Values of olivine/liquidD generally increase with decreasing temperature and melt MgO content, and with increasing melt SiO2 content, but generally show poor correlations with other variables. Multi-element olivine/liquidD profiles calculated from regressions of D REE–Sc–Y vs. melt MgO content are compared to results of the Lattice Strain Model to link melt MgO and: D0 (the strain compensated partition coefficient), EM3+ (Young's Modulus), and r0 (the size of the M site). Ln D0 varies linearly with Ln MgO in the melt; EM3+ varies linearly with melt MgO, with a dog-leg at ca. 1.5{\%} MgO; and r0 remains constant at 0.807 {\AA}. These equations are then used to calculate olivine/liquidD for these elements using the Lattice Strain Model. These empirical parameterizations of olivine/liquidD variations yield results comparable to experimental or natural partitioning data, and can easily be integrated into existing trace element modeling algorithms. The olivine/liquidD data suggest that basaltic melts in equilibrium with pure olivine may acquire small negative Ta–Hf–Zr–Ti anomalies, but that negative Nb anomalies are unlikely to develop. Misfits between results of the Lattice Strain Model and most light rare earth and large ion lithophile partitioning data suggest that kinetic effects may limit the lower value of D for extremely incompatible elements in natural situations characterized by high cooling/crystallization rates.},

abstract = {Teide Volcano has many different meanings: For the Guanche aborigines, who endured several of its eruptions, it was Echeide (Hell). Early navigators had in Teide, a lifesaving widely visible landmark that was towering over the clouds. For the first explorers, Teide was a challenging and dangerous climb, since it was thought that Teide's peak was so high that from its summit the sun was too close and far too hot to survive. Teide was considered the highest mountain in the world at that time and measuring its height precisely was a great undertaking and at the time of global scientific significance. For von Buch, von Humboldt, Lyell and other great 18th and19th century naturalists, Teide helped to shape a new and now increasingly 'volcanic' picture, where the origin of volcanic rocks (from solidified magma) slowly casted aside Neptunism and removed some of the last barriers for the development of modern Geology and Volcanology as the sciences we know today. For the present day population of Tenerife, living on top of the world's third tallest volcanic structure on the planet, Teide has actually become "Padre Teide", a fatherly protector and an emblematic icon of Tenerife, not to say of the Canaries as a whole. The UNESCO acknowledged this iconic and complex volcano, as "of global importance in providing evidence of the geological processes that underpin the evolution of oceanic islands". Today, 'Teide National Park' boasts 4 Million annual visitors including many 'volcano spotters' and is a spectacular natural environment which most keep as an impression to treasure and to never forget. For us, the editors of this book, Teide is all of the above; a 'hell of a job', a navigation point on cloudy days, a challenge beyond imagination, a breakthrough in our understanding of oceanic volcanism that has shaped our way of thinking about volcanoes, and lastly, Teide provides us with a reference point from where to start exploring other oceanic volcanoes in the Canaries and beyond. Here we have compiled the different aspects and the current understanding of this natural wonder.},

abstract = {The Laki (Skaft{\'{a}}r Fires) fissure eruption in southern Iceland lasted for eight months during 1783 to 1784, and produced one of the largest basaltic lava flows in historic times (14.7±1.0 km3). In addition, neighboring Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn central volcano was frequently active during the period from May 1783 to May 1785. The combined activity is interpreted as having been the result of a two-year-long volcano-tectonic episode on the Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn volcanic system. Contemporary descriptions of the explosive activity make it possible to relate the tephra stratigraphy to the progress of the eruption on a weekly basis and show that activity on the fissures propagated to the NE with time, towards Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn. The eruption at Laki began on 8 June with a brief explosive event on a short fissure, and lava rapidly began to flow into the Skaft{\'{a}} river gorge. It reached the lowlands, 35 km away, four days later and continued to flow, with variable discharge, until 7 February 1784. Approximately 90{\%} of the lava was emplaced in the first five months of activity. The 27-km-long vent complex is composed of tenen echelon fissures distributed on both sides of the much older Laki hyaloclastite mountain. The surface expression of each fissure is a continuous row of vents consisting of scoria cones, spatter cones, and tuff cones. Six tephra fall units are positively identified; two units are completely compsed of phreatomagmatic tephra derived from two tuff cones and the others are Strombolian deposits. The volume of tephra, including ash fall that extended to mainland Europe, is 0.4 km3 dense rock equivalent volume, or 2.6{\%} of the total erupted volume. Interpretation of contemporary descriptions of tephra falls, combined with the preserved stratigraphy, allow the identification of ten eruptive episodes during the eight months of activity on the Laki fissures. These eruptive episodes are inferred to have resulted from the unsteady flow of magma in the feeder system. In addition, at least eight eruption episodes occurred at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn in 1783 to 1785, five in 1783, two in 1784, and one in 1785. Each episode at Laki began with a seismic swarm of increasing intensity that led to the formation of a new fissure, the opening of which was followed by short-lived phreatomagmatic activity caused by the high water table around the eruption site. Activity usually changed to violent Strombolian or sub-Plinian, followed by Hawaiian fire fountaining and effusive activity as the availability of groundwater dwindled. Thus, the explosive activity associated with the opening of each fissure was largely controlled by external watermagma interactions. Maximum effusion rates, occurring in the first two episodes, are estimated to have been 8.5x103 and 8.7x103 m3 s-1 from fissures totaling 2.2 and 2.8 km in length, respectively, and, in general, discharge gradually decreased over time. The highest rates are equivalent to 5.6x103 and 4.5x103 kg s-1 per meter length of fissure, values that could conceivably be similar to those that produced some flood basalt lava flows. Maximum fire fountain heights are estimated to have varied from 800 m to 1400 m and convecting eruption columns above the vents rose to a maximum altitude of about 15 km. The release of sulfur gases during fountaining produced an acid haze (aerosol) which spread widely and had a considerable environmental, and possibly climatic, impact on the Northern Hemisphere.},

abstract = {Despite the growing evidence that the vapor phase, formed through magma degassing and ore fluid boiling, can selectively concentrate and transport metals, the effects of major volatile components like sulfur, chlorine or carbon dioxide on the metal vapor-liquid fractionation and vapor-phase transport under magmatic-hydrothermal conditions remain poorly known. We performed systematic experiments to investigate the effect of sulfur ligands on metal vapor-liquid partitioning in model H2O-S-NaCl-KCl-NaOH systems at temperatures from 350 to 500 °C. Results show that at acidic-to-neutral conditions, vapor-liquid equilibrium distribution coefficients, Km = mvapor / mliquid, where m is the mass concentration of the metal in corresponding phase, of metalloids (As, Sb) and base metals (Zn, Fe, Pb, Ag) are in the range 0.1-1.0 and 0.001-0.1, respectively, and are not significantly affected by the presence of geologically common sulfur concentrations, up to 1-3 wt.{\%} S. In contrast, the partitioning of Cu, Au, and Pt into the vapor increases by a factor of 100 in comparison to the S-free water-salt system, yielding Km values of 0.5-1.0, 1-10, and 10-20, respectively, due to formation of volatile neutral complexes with H2S and, possibly, SO2. In neutral-to-basic systems, Zn, Pb, Fe and Ag show 10-100-fold increase of their partition coefficients, whereas Cu, Au and Pt exhibit Km values of up to several orders of magnitude lower, compared to acidic conditions at similar temperature, pressure and sulfur contents. These vapor-liquid distribution patterns result from combined effects of i) formation of volatile species with reduced sulfur ligands in the vapor phase, ii) changes in the metal speciation in the coexisting liquid phase as a function of pH, and iii) solute-solvent interactions in both phases. Our data explain the vapor-liquid fractionation trends for many metals as inferred in coexisting brine and vapor inclusions from magmatic-hydrothermal deposits, and provide a first experimental evidence for the dramatic increase of the mobility of Cu, Au and Pt in sulfur-enriched acidic magmatic-hydrothermal vapors, consistent with geological models of Au ± Cu ores formation and distribution in porphyry-epithermal settings. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Within our Solar System, Earth is the only planet to be in a mobile-lid regime. It is generally accepted that the other terrestrial planets are currently in a stagnant-lid regime, with the possible exception of Venus that may be in an episodic-lid regime. In this study, we use numerical simulations to address the question of whether melting-induced crustal production changes the critical yield stress needed to obtain mobile-lid behaviour (plate tectonics). Our results show that melting-induced crustal production strongly influences plate tectonics on Earth-like planets by strongly enhancing the mobility of the lid, replacing a stagnant lid with an episodic lid, or greatly extending the time in which a smoothly evolving mobile lid is present in a planet. Finally, we show that our results are consistent with analytically predicted critical yield stress obtained with boundary layer theory, whether melting-induced crustal production is considered or not.},

Its high viscosity, high yield strength, and chemical buoyancy protected it from being entrained by underlying stagnant lid convection and by subduction. Chemically buoy- ant mantle does not underlie platforms. Platform lithosphere has gradually thickened with time as convection waned as the Earth's interior cooled. The thermal contrac- tion associated with this thickening causes platforms to subside relative to cratons.

abstract = {Apatite is a cumulate phase in the upper parts of some mafic layered intrusions and anorthositic complexes. We investigated the effect of pressure and fluorine on apatite saturation in mafic magmas to better understand under which conditions this mineral crystallizes. Apatite saturation gives information about the formation of silicate rocks, and is of interest in explaining the formation of apatite–oxide-rich rocks (e.g. nelsonites comprising approximately, one-third apatite and two-third Fe–Ti oxide). Two models of formation are proposed for this rock type: crystal fractionation followed by accumulation of apatite and Fe–Ti oxides and liquid immiscibility. New experiments carried out with mafic compositions at 500 MPa confirm that the most important variables on phosphate saturation are SiO2 and CaO. Fluorine addition leads to apatite saturation at lower SiO2 and higher CaO concentrations. Comparison of our results with those of previous experimental studies on liquid–liquid immiscibility at upper-to-mid-crustal conditions allows us to investigate the relative importance of apatite saturation versus liquid–liquid immiscibility in the petrogenesis of nelsonites and similar rocks. The liquid line of descent of three natural examples studied (the Sept-{\^{I}}les intrusive suite, the anorthositic Complex of the Lac-St-Jean and the Skaergaard layered intrusion) do not cross the liquid–liquid immiscibility field before they reach apatite saturation. Thus, the apatite–oxide-rich rock associated with these three intrusive suites are best explained by crystal fractionation followed by accumulation of apatite and Fe–Ti oxides.},

abstract = {We present new viscosity measurements for melts spanning a wide range of anhydrous compositions including: rhyolite, trachyte, moldavite, andesite, latite, pantellerite, basalt and basanite. Micropenetration and concentric cylinder viscometry measurements cover a viscosity range of 10- 1to 1012Pas and a temperature range from 700 to 1650 °C. These new measurements, combined with other published data, provide a high-quality database comprising ∼ 800 experimental data on 44 well-characterized melt compositions. This database is used to recalibrate the model proposed by Giordano and Dingwell [Giordano, D., Dingwell, D.B., 2003a. Non-Arrhenian multicomponent melt viscosity: a model. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 208, 337-349] for predicting the viscosity of natural silicate melts. The present contribution clearly shows that: (1) the viscosity ($\eta$)-temperature relationship of natural silicate liquids is very well represented by the VFT equation [log $\eta$ = A + B / (T - C)] over the full range of viscosity considered here, (2) the use of a constant high-T limiting value of melt viscosity (e.g., A) is fully consistent with the experimental data, (3) there are 3 different compositional suites (peralkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous) that exhibit different patterns in viscosity, (4) the viscosity of metaluminous liquids is well described by a simple mathematical expression involving the compositional parameter (SM) but the compositional dependence of viscosity for peralkaline and peraluminous melts is not fully controlled by SM. For these extreme compositions we refitted the model using a temperature-dependent parameter based on the excess of alkalies relative to alumina (e.g., AE/SM). The recalibrated model reproduces the entire database to within 5{\%} relative error (e.g., RMSE of 0.45 logunits). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Binnemans2013,
abstract = {The rare-earth elements (REEs) are becoming increasingly important in the transition to a green economy, due to their essential role in permanent magnets, lamp phosphors, catalysts, rechargeable batteries etc. With China presently producing more than 90{\%} of the global REE output and its increasingly tight export quota, the rest of the world is confronted with a REE supply risk. Mining companies are now actively seeking new exploitable REE deposits while some old mines are being reopened. Because of the absence of economical and/or operational primary deposits on their territory, many countries will have to rely on recycling of REEs from pre-consumer scrap, industrial residues and REE-containing End-of-Life products. REE recycling is also recommended in view of the so-called "balance problem". For instance, primary mining of REE ores for neodymium generates an excess of the more abundant elements, lanthanum and cerium. Therefore, recycling of neodymium can reduce the total amount of REE ores that need to be extracted. Despite a vast, mostly lab-scale research effort on REE recycling, up to 2011 less than 1{\%} of the REEs were actually recycled. This is mainly due to inefficient collection, technological problems and, especially, a lack of incentives. A drastic improvement in the recycling of REEs is, therefore, an absolute necessity. This can only be realized by developing efficient, fully integrated recycling routes, which can take advantage of the rich REE recycling literature. This paper provides an overview of this literature, with emphasis on three main applications: permanent magnets, nickel metal hydride batteries and lamp phosphors. The state of the art in preprocessing of End-of-Life materials containing REEs and the final REE recovery is discussed in detail. Both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical routes for REE separation from non-REE elements in the recycled fractions are reviewed. The relevance of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for REE recycling is emphasized. The review corroborates that, in addition to mitigating the supply risk, REE recycling can reduce the environmental challenges associated with REE mining and processing. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Field relationships indicate that fault-guided transfer zones allowed magma to jump up-section to form higher-level intrusions. Where sills connect to dikes and magmas moved up-section, roof and wall rocks are characterized by wide and intense contact-metamorphic haloes, consistent with throughflow of magma. The geometric constraints suggest that conduits may have opened episodically and then closed when magma pressure waned. The episodic nature of conduit opening events can explain the pulsed ascent of crystal slurries, and may also play a role in the deposition of Ni-sulfides.},

They consist of a core rich in analcime and arfvedsonite and a rim rich in analcime, aegirine and a low temperature potassium feldspar. The host lujavrite is dominated by albite and arfvedsonite. The igneous lamination of the host continues undisturbed through rim and core of spheroids and the arfvedsonite crystals in host, rim and core have identical chemical compositions. There are sharp contacts between host and rim and rim and core. Host, rim and core contain the same accessory minerals and have almost identical chemical compositions, the main differences are high H2O and Na2O but low SiO2 in the core and high Fe2O3 in the rim. The spheroids are proposed to have been formed by separation of immiscible interstitial H2O-rich globules of magma from the host lujavrite magma at a late stage in the crystallization of the lujavritic melt. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Merensky pegmatoid (normal reef) in the western Bushveld Complex is commonly characterized as a pyroxene-rich pegmatoidal unit with a base that is enriched in chromite and platinum-group element-bearing sulfides overlying a leuconorite footwall. Models for its formation have ranged from those that view it as entirely a magmatic cumulate succession to those that have suggested that it is a zone of volatile-induced remelting. The consequences of the latter interpretation are investigated using the numerical modeling program IRIDIUM, which links diffusive and advective mass and heat transport with a phase equilibration routine based on the MELTS program. The initial system consists of a simple stratigraphic succession of a partially molten leuconorite overlain by a partially molten pyroxenite, both initially at 1,190°C and 2 kbar. 2 wt{\%} of a volatile fluid composed of 75 mol{\%} H2O, 20 mol{\%} CO2 and 5 mol{\%} H2S is then added to the lower 20 cm of the pyroxenite. The system is then allowed to evolve under conditions of chemical diffusion in the liquid. The addition of the volatile components results in a modest increase in the amount of melt in the pyroxenite. However, chemical diffusion across the leuconorite–pyroxenite boundary leads to more extensive melting at and below the boundary with preferential loss of opx from the underlying leuconorite, preferential re-precipitation of sulfide and chromite and concentration of the PGE at this boundary. These results mimic actual mineral and compositional profiles across the Merensky pegmatoid and illustrate that long-term diffusion process can effectively produce mineralogical and compositional layering not present in the original assemblage.},

abstract = {The rift-related magmas of the Proterozoic Gardar Igneous Province were emplaced across the contact between the South Greenland Archaean craton and the Palaeoproterozoic Ketilidian mobile belt. It has been suggested that the geochemistry of Gardar intrusive rocks in the two areas varies across the craton margin and that this reflects a lithospheric control. However, comparison of the geochemical and isotopic signatures of basic and ultrabasic dykes from across the area shows that there is no systematic variation related to the age of the country rock. All the Gardar basic rocks are inferred to have been derived from the mantle, with relatively little crustal contamination. We suggest that the lithospheric mantle beneath the Gardar Province was enriched by slab-derived fluids during the Ketilidian orogeny (c. 1800 Ma). Subsequent melting of this mantle source was promoted during Gardar rifting when volatile-rich, small-degree melts from the asthenosphere were introduced into the lithospheric mantle, forming enriched metasomites. Ultrabasic lamprophyre dykes in the Gardar Province represent melts derived largely from these metasomites, whereas basaltic magmas were formed by larger-scale melting of the lithospheric mantle, inheriting a subduction-related signature. There is no evidence that the Gardar magmas were derived from a highly enriched lithospheric keel that had existed since craton formation.},

abstract = {Recently, rare earth elements (REE) have occupied a centre-stage owing to the large volatility of prices and stress occasioned on global markets by limitations of Chinese export quotas. Thus, numerous industries which depend on secured and diversified rare earths sources, now consider REE as critical for new technologies. In response, countries are developing and diversifying their supply sources, with new mining projects located outside China and efforts in the REE recycling domain. Based on a global geological and metallogenic synthesis, a first review map representing more than 270 REE occurrences and deposits classified by typology in Europe and Greenland is proposed. At first glance, the Baltic Shield and South Greenland constitute the main areas with a strong potential. Indeed, northern Europe is characterised by numerous occurrences linked to alkaline intrusions, carbonatites and pegmatites. In southern Greenland, the Il{\'{i}}maussaq alkaline complex contains the future world-class Kvanefjeld U-REE-Zn deposit. While REE are relatively ubiquitous in Europe and Greenland and occur in a variety of geological settings, only the two previously mentioned regions appear to have economic potential. However, progress in the understanding of the REE ore forming processes is required to help better guide exploration and make new discoveries. While recycling technologies should be developed, reliance on extracted sources will continue to be indispensable, especially considering annual growth rates for REE demand, which are around 5{\%}},

abstract = {The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex contains one of the world's largest concentrations of platinum-group elements (PGE). We have investigated ‘normal' reef, its footwall and its hanging wall at Impala Platinum Mines. The Reef is 46 cm thick and consists from bottom to top of leuconorite, anorthosite, chromitite and a very coarse-grained melanorite. The footwall is leuconorite and the hanging wall is melanorite. The only hydrous mineral present is biotite, which amounts to 1{\%}, or less, of the rock. All of the rocks contain 0{\textperiodcentered}1–5{\%} interstitial sulphides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite), with the Reef rocks containing the most sulphides (1–5{\%}). Lithophile inter-element ratios suggest that the magma from which the rocks formed was a mixture of the two parental magmas of the Bushveld Complex (a high-Mg basaltic andesite and a tholeiitic basalt). The Reef rocks have low incompatible element contents indicating that they contain 10{\%} or less melt fraction. Nickel, Cu, Se, Ag, Au and the PGE show good correlations with S in the silicate rocks, suggesting control of the abundance of these metals by sulphides. The concentration of the chalcophile elements and PGE in the silicate rocks may be modelled by assuming that the rocks contain sulphide liquid formed in equilibrium with the evolving silicate magma. It is, however, difficult to model the Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt concentrations in the chromitites by sulphide liquid collection alone, as the rocks contain 3–4 times more Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt than the sulphide-collection model would predict. Two possible solutions to this are: (1) platinum-group minerals (PGM) crystallize from the sulphide liquid in the chromitites; (2) PGM crystallize directly from the silicate magma. To model the concentrations of Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt in the chromitites it is necessary to postulate that in addition to the 1{\%} sulphides in the chromitites there is a small quantity (0{\textperiodcentered}005{\%}) of cumulus PGM (laurite, cooperite and malanite) present. Sulphide liquids do crystallize PGM at low fS2. Possibly the sulphide liquid that was trapped between the chromite grains lost some Fe and S by reaction with the chromite and this provoked the crystallization of PGM from the sulphide liquid. Alternatively, the PGM could have crystallized directly from the silicate magma when it became saturated in chromite. A weakness of this model is that at present the exact mechanism of how and why the magma becomes saturated in PGM and chromite synchronously is not understood. A third model for the concentration of PGE in the Reef is that the PGE are collected from the underlying cumulus pile by Cl-rich hydrous fluids and concentrated in the Reef at a reaction front. Although there is ample evidence of compaction and intercumulus melt migration in the Impala rocks, we do not think that the PGE were introduced into the Reef from below, because the rocks underlying the Reef are not depleted in PGE, whereas those overlying the Reef are depleted. This distribution pattern is inconsistent with a model that requires introduction of PGE by intercumulus fluid percolation from below.},

The glass compositions examined were albite (NaAlSi3O8), sodium trisilicate (Na2Si3O7), and a peralkaline composition (Na3.3AlSi7O,17) approximately halfway between the two. The volatile contents were approximately 1–2 wt{\%} fluorine or. chlorine. Our results indicate that La, Gd, and Yb form complexes with fluorine in the glasses studied. Gd and Yb are coordinated by eight fluorines with no apparent oxygen neighbors [￼; ￼]. La appears to form mixed O-F complexes consisting of eight ligands approximately evenly divided between fluorine and oxygen [￼; ￼]. We found no evidence for REE-Cl complexes in the compositions studied. The rare earth sites in chlorine-containing melts are, however, more regular than those in volatile-free melts, suggesting that Cl acts to depolymerize the tetrahedral network. Fluorine, because of complex formation and its effect on melt structure and chlorine, because of its effect on melt structure, should both act to decrease crystal-melt partition coefficients of rare earths.},

abstract = {Using a newly-calibrated relation for cerium redox equilibria in silicate melts (Smythe and Brenan, 2015), and an internally-consistent model for zircon-melt partitioning of Ce, we provide a method to estimate the prevailing redox conditions during crystallization of zircon-saturated magmas. With this approach, oxygen fugacities were calculated for samples from the Bishop tuff (USA), Toba tuff (Indonesia) and the Nain plutonic suite (Canada), which typically agree with independent estimates within one log unit or better. With the success of reproducing the fO2 of well-constrained igneous systems, we have applied our Ce-in-zircon oxygen barometer to estimating the redox state of Earth's earliest magmas. Using the composition of the Jack Hills Hadean zircons, combined with estimates of their parental magma composition, we determined the fO2 during zircon crystallization to be between FMQ ???1.0 to +2.5 (where FMQ is the fayalite???magnetite???quartz buffer). Of the parental magmas considered, Archean tonalite???trondhjemite???granodiorite (TTG) compositions yield zircon-melt partitioning most similar to well-constrained modern suites (e.g., Sano et al., 2002). Although broadly consistent with previous redox estimates from the Jack Hills zircons, our results provide a more precise determination of fO2, narrowing the range for Hadean parental magmas by more than 8 orders of magnitude. Results suggest that relatively oxidized magmatic source regions, similar in oxidation state to that of 3.5 Ga komatiite suites, existed by ???4.4 Ga.},

abstract = {Sufficient geochronological data are available pertaining to the north-central part of the Kaapvaal craton to construct a chronostratigraphic framework for the rock units involved in the Vredefort event, from the basement rocks at ∼ 3170 Ma to the Waterberg-Soutpansberg Groups deposited between ∼ 2025 and 1425 Ma. The resulting framework forms a convenient chronological guide to the geological evolution of this area, and the timing of events such as that at Vredefort. The basement on which the supracrustal rocks were deposited stabilised from ∼ 3170 to 3060 Ma but metamorphism and metasomatism of these rocks occurred up to 2800 m.y. ago in different parts of the craton. The first unit of the Wits triad, the volcaniclastic Dominion Group, was deposited at ∼ 3060 Ma on the stabilising basement. This was followed by the dominantly clastic Witwatersrand Supergroup and the overlying Ventersdorp Supergroup. The dominantly volcanic Ventersdorp rocks are ∼ 2700 m.y. old and form the last unit of the Wits triad. A considerable time gap of ∼ 200-300 Ma separates the triad from the lowermost units of the overlying Transvaal Sequence. The age of these volcanic and clastic protobasinal rocks is poorly constrained, between ∼ 2500 and 2300 Ma. They may in fact represent eroded remnants of a more extensive depositional cycle. The mainly clastic sedimentary part of the Transvaal Sequence (Pretoria Group) has been dated at ∼ 2224 Ma. The upper part of the Transvaal Sequence (Rooiberg Group) is only constrained by the age of the intrusive Bushveld Complex. The Bushveld basic layered rocks are well dated at ∼ 2060 Ma, as are the subsequent granites at ∼ 2050 Ma. The Vredefort event, which post-dates the Bushveld Complex, is reasonably well constrained by the age of the bronzite granophyre at ∼ 2000 Ma. Deposition of the Waterberg and Soutpansberg Groups, which post-date the Bushveld Complex is poorly constrained between the age of the Bushveld granites and younger alkaline intrusives at ∼ 1425 Ma, but these sediments and volcanics were probably formed between ∼ 2025 and 1752 Ma. The Waterberg Group may therefore contain debris from the Vredefort structure. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {More than a decade ago, ice core records from Greenland revealed that the last glacial period was characterized by abrupt climate changes that recurred on millennial time scales. Since their discovery, there has been a large effort to determine whether these climate events were a global phenomenon or were just confined to the North Atlantic region and also to reveal the mechanisms that were responsible for them. In this paper, we review the available paleoclimate observations of abrupt change during the last glacial period in order to place constraints on possible mechanisms. Three different mechanisms are then reviewed: ocean thermohaline circulation, sea ice feedbacks, and tropical processes. Each mechanism is tested for its ability to explain the key features of the observations, particularly with regard to the abruptness, millennial recurrence, and geographical extent of the observed changes. It is found that each of these mechanisms has explanatory strengths and weaknesses, and key areas in which progress could be made in improving the understanding of their long-term behavior, both from observational and modeling approaches, are suggested. Finally, it is proposed that a complete understanding of the mechanisms of abrupt change requires inclusion of processes at both low and high latitudes, as well as the potential for feedbacks between them. Some suggestions for experimental approaches to test for such feedbacks with coupled climate models are given.},

abstract = {The grain-scale processes of peridotite melting were examined at 1,340°C and 1.5 GPa using reaction couples formed by juxtaposing pre-synthesized clinopyroxenite against pre-synthesized orthopyroxenite or harzburgite in graphite and platinum-lined molybdenum capsules. Reaction between the clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene-rich aggregates produces a melt-enriched, orthopyroxene-free, olivine + clinopyroxene reactive boundary layer. Major and trace element abundance in clinopyroxene vary systematically across the reactive boundary layer with compositional trends similar to the published clinopyroxene core-to-rim compositional variations in the bulk lherzolite partial melting studies conducted at similar P–T conditions. The growth of the reactive boundary layer takes place at the expense of the orthopyroxenite or harzburgite and is consistent with grain-scale processes that involve dissolution, precipitation, reprecipitation, and diffusive exchange between the interstitial melt and surrounding crystals. An important consequence of dissolution–reprecipitation during crystal-melt interaction is the dramatic decrease in diffusive reequilibration time between coexisting minerals and melt. This effect is especially important for high charged, slow diffusing cations during peridotite melting and melt-rock reaction. Apparent clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients for REE, Sr, Y, Ti, and Zr, measured from reprecipitated clinopyroxene and coexisting melt in the reactive boundary layer, approach their equilibrium values reported in the literature. Disequilibrium melting models based on volume diffusion in solid limited mechanism are likely to significantly underestimate the rates at which major and trace elements in residual minerals reequilibrate with their surrounding melt.},

abstract = {It is thought that the first continental crust formed by melting of either eclogite or amphibolite, either at subduction zones or on the underside of thick oceanic crust. However, the observed compositions of early crustal rocks and experimental studies have been unable to distinguish between these possibilities. Here we show a clear contrast in trace-element ratios of melts derived from amphibolites and those from eclogites. Partial melting of low-magnesium amphibolite can explain the low niobium/tantalum and high zirconium/samarium ratios in melts, as required for the early continental crust, whereas the melting of eclogite cannot. This indicates that the earliest continental crust formed by melting of amphibolites in subduction-zone environments and not by the melting of eclogite or magnesium-rich amphibolites in the lower part of thick oceanic crust. Moreover, the low niobium/tantalum ratio seen in subduction-zone igneous rocks of all ages is evidence that the melting of rutile-eclogite has never been a volumetrically important process.},

abstract = {The Chicxulub impact crater in Mexico is the site of the impact purported to have caused mass extinctions at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary. 2-D hydrocode modeling of the impact, coupled with studies of the impact site geology, indicate that between 0.4 and 7.0 × 1017g of sulfur were vaporized by the impact into anhydrite target rocks. A small portion of the sulfur was released as SO3or SO4, which converted rapidly into H2SO4aerosol and fell as acid rain. A radiative transfer model, coupled with a model of coagulation indicates that the aerosol prolonged the initial blackout period caused by impact dust only if the aerosol contained impurities. A larger portion of sulfur was released as SO2, which converted to aerosol slowly, due to the rate-limiting oxidation of SO2. Our radiative transfer calculations, combined with rates of acid production, coagulation, and diffusion indicate that solar transmission was reduced to 10-20{\%} of normal for a period of 8-13 yr. This reduction produced a climate forcing (cooling) of -300 Wm-2, which far exceeded the +8 Wm-2greenhouse warming, caused by the CO2released through the vaporization of carbonates, and therefore produced a decade of freezing and near-freezing temperatures. Several decades of moderate warming followed the decade of severe cooling due to the long residence time of CO2. The prolonged impact winter may have been a major cause of the K/T extinctions. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Subduction is an effective mechanism for deep recycling of supracrustal rocks and mantle refertilization. However, the timing of the onset of modern-style deep subduction is debated. Here we report geochronogical and geochemical data for an intrusive suite of ultramafic, syenitic and carbonatitic rocks, a carbonatite-hosted peridotite xenolith, and granulites from the Paleoproterozoic Trans-North China orogen in the North China craton (NCC). The xenolith differs in composition from typical cratonic mantle peridotites. It equilibrated at T ≈ 1100 oC and P ≈ 29 kbar, i.e. under hotter conditions than cratonic mantle xenoliths worldwide. The carbonatites and associated alkaline rocks were emplaced at 1810 ± 3 Ma and are related to the Paleoproterozoic collision between the Western and Eastern segments of the NCC. These intrusions show Sr-Nd isotope compositions consistent with an enriched mantle source [(87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7027-0.7039; $\epsilon$Nd(t) = -4 to -6], and contain zircon characterized by unradiogenic Hf isotope compositions [$\epsilon$Hf(t) = -5 to -9] and high $\delta$18Osmow values (7.9-9.5 ‰). In contrast, basement granulites and wall-rock granites are enriched in radiogenic Nd and Hf isotopes, but low in 18O. These differences rule out the possibility of crustal contamination. Our results thus suggest that modern-style plate tectonics dates back at least to the Paleoproterozoic Era, and the post-collisional Paleoproterozoic alkaline magmatism in the NCC tapped mantle sources modified by deep sediment recycling.},

abstract = {We report field, petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical data for two P-rich rock types of the anorthosite suite—Fe-Ti oxide-apatite rock (or nelsonite) and Fe-Ti oxide-apatite gabbronorite (or oxide-apatite gabbronorite). These rocks are take from the Ch{\^{a}}teau-Richer, Labrieville, and St. Urbain massifs in Quebec; from the Roseland massif in Virginia; and from the Carthage massif in New York. Our data set includes X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and instrumental neutron activation (INA) analyses of whole-rock samples, as well as electron-microprobe (EMP) and INA analyses of separated apatites. At St. Urbain and Labrieville, nelsonite forms a small capping on massive hemoilmenite deposits fully contained within anorthosite, whereas at Roseland, nelsonite occurs as dikelike bodies within country rock. All three nelsonite occurrences consist almost entirely of ilmenite + apatite (but do not have a 2:1 oxide/apatite ratio), with only trace amounts of other minerals. All oxide-apatite gabbronorites form sill-like layers within or near the margins of anorthosite massifs and contain ilmenite ± magnetite, apatite, orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene, and plagioclase. All apatites are F rich and Cl poor, consistent with high-temperature magmatic crystallization. Concentrations of apatite rare earth elements (REE) are highly variable (e.g., LaN ≈ 700–2,000× chondrites), but patterns show a consistent fractionation (e.g., LaN/LuN ≈ 10–20) with small to moderate negative Eu anomalies. Interestingly, the Labrieville nelsonite and its apatite lack an Eu anomaly, consistent with crystallization in a highly oxidizing environment. Apatites in both rock types are enriched in REE relative to whole-rock samples (by factors of 3 to 10), but REE patterns of apatites and whole rocks are parallel in each case. Mass-balance calculations indicate that for nelsonite, 100 percent of the REE is contained in apatite; for oxide-apatite gabbronorites, {\~{}}100 percent of the light REE, {\~{}}90 percent of the middle to heavy REE, and {\~{}}75 percent of Eu are in apatite. These results can be explained satisfactorily by assuming that the rocks are cumulate in origin. If, on the other hand, nelsonites and oxide-apatite gabbronorites represent liquids, apatite DREE values must vary by more than a factor of 3. Our field, mineralogical, and geochemical observations indicate that most nelsonites and oxide-apatite gabbronorites are not related directly. Indeed, apatites from oxide-apatite gabbronorites contain lower Sr and MgO but higher REE than those in nelsonites, indicating that nelsonites are the more primitive rock type. Nelsonites probably formed as cumulates primarily within larger deposits of Fe-Ti oxide (locally mobilized as dikelike bodies). oxide-apatite gabbronorites also represent cumulates, but these are related spatially and genetically to associated jotunites and mangerites and appear to form at several stages in the evolution of a particular anorthosite complex.},

abstract = {The Suzhou Cretaceous (Yanshanian) pluton is a small high-level anorogenic composite body of two different biotite granite intrusions.  They correspond to two batches (with an apparent gap of 10 Ma) of magma with A-type affinities. Sub-, trans- and hypersolvus textures of feldspars are present in the first intrusion, whereas hypersolvus textures dominate in the second.  Biotite appears as a late (interstitial or in cluster) magmatic phase.  All the granites are Si-alkali-F rich and Mg-Ca-Ti poor, and can be termed highly fractionated felsic granites.  HFSE (but also some LILE) content is high and increases dramatically with inferred differentiation.  If a classical fractional crystallization model can be invoked for the first intrusion, a more complicated petrogenetic path has be considered for the second.  Biotite-rich sequences or layers up to true 'biotite' bodies (up to 30 vol.{\%} of F-rich, annite-like biotite) occur structurally close to the roof of the second intrusion.  Together with their high biotite content, these bodies are characterized by a particularly rich accessory suite, where zircon, a Th-, Ca-rich fluoride, and fluorite are dominant, which is responsible for high chemical anomalies (3.5 wt.{\%} Zr, 0.52 wt.{\%} Th, 5.42 wt.{\%} F in whole-rock) and for a strong asymmetrical partitioning of HREE [(La/Yb)N {\textless}{\textless} 1] in the biotite-rich bodies. A petrogenetic model of a water-poor, F-rich, high-temperature magma which becomes volatile saturated late in the crystallization sequence (with biotite as an interstitial phase, and miarolitic cavities), in a subvolcanic setting (porphyritic and granophyric textures are present) seems likely.  The large increase in most of the HFSE correlates with F.  This correlation originated at the magmatic stage.  Subsequent fluorine complexing is assumed to have scoured and transported these HFSE as soluble components.  The 'biotitite' differentiates are assumed to result from the reaction of these F-rich fluids with the surrounding granite along specific structural traps close to the roof of the second intrusion.  Zr, Th, and REE enrichment in residual melt appeared as a consequence of the initial alkaline character of the melt and was followed by alkali loss through degassing.  Isotopic constraints on the source of magmas are ambiguous and even conflicting.  According to the Sm-Nd signature, the source of magmas is obviously crustal, whereas a mantle imprint seems evident from the stable-isotope distribution.  A model of low degree of crustal partial melting under anhydrous conditions of a lower crust enriched in F (and LILE and HFSE) would be likely.  Mantle participation would be indirectly invoked through F-rich fluids which originated from mantle defluorination.  Protracted fractionation, volatile-melt unmixing, alkali loss, and contrasted metasomatism along structural traps are discussed as tentative explanations for the rare-metal enrichment in the 'biotitite' occurrences.},

abstract = {The partitioning of platinum-group elements (PGE; Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) and Au between sulfide melt and silicate melt (i.e., DPGEsul) exerts a critical control on the PGE composition of the Earth's crust and mantle, but previous estimates have been plagued by experimental uncertainties and vary through several orders of magnitude. Here we present direct experimental measurements of DPGEsul, based on in situ microanalysis of the sulfide and silicate melt, with values ranging from {\~{}}4??105 (Ru) to {\~{}}2-3??106 (Ir, Pt). Our measurements of DPGEsul are {\textgreater}100 times larger than previous results but smaller than anticipated based on comparison of alloy solubilities in sulfide melts and S-free silicate melts. The presence of S in the silicate melt greatly increases alloy solubility. We use our new set of partition coefficients to develop a fully constrained model of PGE behavior during melting which accurately predicts the abundances of PGE in mantle-derived magmas and their restites, including mid-ocean ridge basalts, continental picrites, and the parental magmas of the Bushveld Complex of South Africa. Our model constrains mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) to be the products of pooled low and high degree fractional melts. Within-plate picrites are pooled products of larger degrees of fractional melting in columnar melting regimes. A significant control on PGE fractionation in mantle-derived magmas is exerted by residual alloy or platinum group minerals in their source. At low pressures (e.g., MORB genesis) the mantle residual to partial melting retains primitive mantle inter-element ratios and abundances of PGE until sulfide has been completely dissolved but then evolves to extremely high Pt/Pd and low Pd/Ir because Pt and Ir alloys form in the restite. During melting at high pressure to form picrites or komatiites Ir alloy appears as a restite phase but Pt alloy is not stable due to the large effect of pressure on fS2, and of temperature on fO2 along an internal oxygen buffer, which causes large increases in alloy solubility. The magmas parental to the Bushveld Complex of South Africa appear, at least in part, to be partial melts of mantle that has previously been melted to the point of total sulfide exhaustion at low pressure, closely resembling mantle xenoliths of the Kaapvaal craton. Using the new extremely large DPGEsul the world-class Merensky Reef and UG2 Pt deposits of the Bushveld Complex can readily be modeled as the result of sulfide saturation due to mixing of magmas with unremarkable PGE contents, obviating the need to postulate anomalously PGE-rich parent magmas or hydrothermal inputs to the deposits. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal transport and deposition of high field strength elements (HFSE) attracts increasing attention as demand for these strategic metals rises. Data on the stability of aqueous complexes of geochemical twins, such as zirconium (ionic radius 590 pm) and hafnium (580 pm), can provide us with insights into the processes that concentrate these elements in HFSE deposits. Fluoride is an important ligand in such systems, greatly enhancing the solubility of HFSE. Fluorine-rich hydrothermal processes are also known to fractionate geochemical twins (including Zr/Hf) much more strongly than other geological processes. Here we report experimentally determined Hf fluoride formation constants for 150, 200, and 250°C and saturated water pressure. The data were obtained using the method applied by Migdisov et al. [1] to determine Zr speciation in fluoride-bearing aqueous fluids. The pH and fluoride concentration range considered was 1.3 to 2.5 and 7e-4 to 2e-1, respectively. Our experiments show that Hf is complexed exclusively as di- fluorohydroxy species under the conditions of our experiments. Zirconium forms either mono- or di-fluorohydroxy complexes under the same conditions, depending on fluoride activity [1]. This shows that Hf has a higher affinity for F than Zr. The di- fluorohydroxy complexes of Hf are more stable than those of Zr. We conclude that the differential behavior of Zr and Hf in fluoride-bearing aqueous fluids is the reason for the high temperature fractionation of of these metals in hydrothermal HFSE deposits. In combination with other geochemical information, the data presented here allows us to better quantify the behaviour of Zr and Hf during HFSE ore-formation. [1] Migdisov et al. (2011) Geochim.

abstract = {Microrhythmic layering is locally developed in agpaitic arfvedsonite lujavrite from the Il{\'{i}}maussaq alkaline complex, South Greenland. Three–15-cm-thick laminated dark layers alternate with 1–10-cm-thick, light-coloured granular urtitic layers. Dark layers are uniform (isomodal) but the urtitic layers are enriched in early nepheline and eudialyte in their lower parts and in late analcime and REE phosphate minerals in the upper parts. The layers are separated by sharp contacts; they are draped around rafts from the overlying roof zone and lack structures indicative of current processes or post-cumulus deformation. Compared with the background arfvedsonite lujavrite of the complex, the dark layers are richer in sodalite, microcline and arfvedsonite and poorer in analcime and eudialyte. They have higher K2O, Cl, FeO⁎ and S but lower Na2O, H2O+, Zr and P contents, the opposite of the light-coloured layers. The complementary chemistry of the two types of layers oscillates about the composition of the background arfvedsonite lujavrite. Layers probably formed in a stagnant bottom layer of the lujavrite magma chamber. Each layer started as a liquid layer which exchanged components with the underlying crystallization front. On cooling, it crystallized primocrysts and exchanged components with the overlying magma which became a new, complementary liquid layer and, during further cooling and burial within the sequence of layers, it underwent largely closed-system interstitial crystallization. Exhaustion of Cl and a sharp decrease in aNaCl relative to aH2O terminated the crystallization of a sodalite-rich dark layer and initiated abundant crystallization of nepheline in the overlying liquid layer (urtitic layer). The layered sequence represents a local K2O-, Cl-rich but Na2O-, H2O-poor facies of arfvedsonite lujavrite and may have formed by exchanging components with sodalite-bearing rafts from the roof zone.},

abstract = {The abundances of the platinum-group elements (PGE), and their relative proportions, are summarized for all the mines exploiting the Merensky Reef on both western and eastern limbs of the Bushveld Complex, in South Africa. Grades for the mined reef interval are uniform over 100 km of strike length, at 5–7 g/t, except for Union mine, where it is currently 8 g/t. The relative proportions of the various PGE are extremely constant over this same distance. In contrast, the platinum-group minerals (PGM) vary enormously. On a regional scale around the western limb, the mineralogy ranges from alloy-dominated in the northwest to sulfide- or telluride–arsenide-dominant in the southeast. Local features that are important in terms of mining are potholes and discordant ultramafic bodies. Comparative studies of the PGE from close to and within such structures again show constant absolute and relative abundances. Limited data on the PGE from PGE-mineralized pipes (Onverwacht, Mooihoek and Driekop) suggest that they are Pt-dominated, and have a totally different relative pattern of distribution of the PGE than that in the stratiform mineralization. The PGM in the vicinity of these pipes also tends to be dominated by alloys, and in potholes by alloys and tellurides and arsenides. Hence, on both a regional scale and very local scale associated with disturbances in the reef, there is a dichotomy between the constancy of the PGE and the variability of the PGM. These observations suggest that the primary mechanism concentrating the PGE is a first-order process, and that the evolution of the PGM is the result of secondary processes related to cooling, local changes in f(S2) in the crystallization environment, and subsolidus re-equilibration. The debate as to whether the PGE are derived by fluid scavenging of a footwall succession or have accumulated from supernatant magma is reexamined, and unresolved problems pertaining to both processes are highlighted.},

abstract = {The Strange Lake Zr, Y, REE, Nb, and Be deposit is hosted by a small, high-level, Late-Proterozoic peralkaline granite stock that intruded into high-grade metamorphic gneisses on the Quebec-Labrador border. The stock is extensively altered. Early alteration is manifested by the replacement of arfvedsonite with aegirine. Later alteration involved Ca-Na exchange. Zr, Ti, Y, REEs, Nb, and Be are concentrated in Ca-bearing minerals that, together with quartz, commonly pseudomorph Na-bearing minerals. Fluid inclusions in pseudomorphs comprise several distinct types: high-salinity (13 to 24 wt{\%} NaCl eq.), Ca-rich aqueous inclusions that homogenize to liquid between 135 and 195°C; mixed aqueousmethane inclusions; methane inclusions; and solid-bearing inclusions. Aqueous-methane inclusions represent heterogeneous entrapment of immiscible high-salinity aqueous liquid and methane. Bastn{\"{a}}site (tentatively identified by SEM analysis) occurs as a daughter mineral. Other daughter or trapped minerals include a Y, HREE-bearing mineral, possibly gagarinite, and hematite, galena, sphalerite, fluorite, pyrochlore, kutnahorite (?), and griceite (?). The first three inclusion types also occur in quartz in pegmatites and veins together with lower-temperature, lower-salinity, Na-dominated aqueous inclusions. The entrapment temperature inferred for the aqueous inclusions from microthermometry and the Na-K-Ca geothermometer range from 155 to 195°C for the higher-salinity inclusions and 100 to 165°C for the low-salinity inclusions. A model is proposed in which the intrusion of a peralkaline granite to high crustal levels initiated a ground/formational water-dominated hydrothermal system in adjacent gabbroic, calc-silicate, and graphitic gneisses. Reaction of the high-salinity, Ca-rich liquid with the graphitic gneisses led to the production of an immiscible methane gas. Subsequent interaction of this liquid with the granite led to extensive replacement of sodic minerals by calcium analogues at temperatures of less than 200°C. Some time after the onset of Ca metasomatism the high-salinity liquid mixed with a Ca-poor, low-salinity, low-temperature liquid that had leached F and rare metals from the granite. Yttrium and REE mineral deposition occurred as a result of the decreased ligand concentration that accompanied fluorite deposition during mixing of the Ca-rich and Ca-poor aqueous liquids.},

abstract = {The Lofdal Intrusive Suite is currently the target of mineral exploration for its heavy rare earth element (HREE) mineralisation. As a result, there is a need to develop a model that can guide this exploration. This study examines the magmatic evolution of the igneous system, which consists of silica-undersaturated alkaline rocks (phono-tephrite, phonolite and its plutonic equivalent, nepheline syenite) and calcio-carbonatite, and develops a genetic model that includes a source for the HREE. Emplacement of the Lofdal Intrusive Suite occurred during a period of rifting prior to the Damara Orogeny, into Paleoproterozoic basement rocks of the Huab Metamorphic Complex. Trace element ratios (Y/Ho, Zr/Hf and Nb/Ta), as well as oxygen and carbon isotope ratios for calcite from the calcio-carbonatite close to mantle values suggest that the corresponding magmas had a mantle origin. The phono-tephrite is the most basic of the silicate magmas and has the most restricted range of compositions. This and the observation that Harker diagrams display linear trends from phono-tephrite to phonolite and nepheline syenite suggest that the phono-tephrite evolved to phonolite and nepheline syenite by fractional crystallisation. Modelling of this process is consistent with fractionation of plagioclase and clinopyroxene, as well as minor proportions of apatite and Ti-bearing magnetite. The fact that the nepheline syenite has a lower content of REE compared to the phonolite is likely due to fractionation of the REE into apatite, an early crystallising phase that settled under the influence of gravity to the lower, currently unexposed, part of the magma chamber. The calcio-carbonatite has chondrite-normalised REE profiles that are parallel to those of the phonolite and nepheline syenite. However, the absolute REE content of the calcio-carbonatite is higher and there is a systematic increase in the La/Lu ratio from phono-tephrite to phonolite and carbonatite. The formation of the calcio-carbonatite is therefore attributed to continued fractionation of the phono-tephrite magma after crystallisation of the most evolved phonolites. This would have driven the melt to a more Ca- and volatile-rich composition, culminating in a small residue of calcio-carbonatite liquid that produced calcio-carbonatites, which unlike most carbonatites elsewhere are unusually enriched in HREE and represent a possible source for the albitite-hosted HREE mineralisation at Lofdal.},

abstract = {Gravitational interactions between a planet and its protoplanetary disk change the planet's orbit, causing the planet to migrate toward or away from its star. Migration rates are poorly constrained for low-mass bodies but reasonably well understood for giant planets. In both cases, significant migration will affect the details and efficiency of planet formation. If the disk is turbulent, density fluctuations will excite orbital eccentricities and cause orbits to undergo a random walk. Both processes are probably detrimental to planet formation. Planets that form early in the lifetime of a disk are likely to be lost, whereas late-forming planets will survive and may undergo little migration. Migration can explain the observed orbits and masses of extrasolar planets if giants form at different times and over a range of distances. Migration can also explain the existence of planets orbiting close to their star and of resonant pairs of planets.},

abstract = {We report the results of partial melting experiments between 8 and 32 kbar, on four natural amphibolites representative of metamorphosed Archean tholeiite (greenstone), high-alumina basalt, low-potassium tholeiite and alkali-rich basalt. For each rock, toe monitor changes in the relative proportions and composition of partial melt and coexisting residual (crystalline) phases from 1000 to 1150 degrees C, within and beyond the amphibole dehydration reaction interval. Low percentage melts coexisting with an amphibolite or garnet amphibolite residue at 1000-1025 degrees C and 8-16 kbar are highly silicic (high-K2O granitic at similar to 5{\%} melting, low-Al2O3 trondhjemitic at similar to 5-10{\%}). Greater than 20{\%} melting is only achieved beyond the amphibole-out phase boundary. Silicic to intermediate composition liquids (high-Al2O3 trondhjemitic-tonalitic, granodioritic, quartz dioritic, dioritic) result from similar to 20-40{\%} melting between 1050 and 1100 degrees C, leaving a granulite (plagioclase + clinopyroxene +/- orthopyroxene +/- olivine) residue at 8 kbar and garnet granulite to eclogite (garnet + clinopyroxene) residues at 12-32 kbar. Still higher degrees of melting (similar to 40-60{\%}) result in mafic liquids corresponding to low-MgO, high-Al2O3 basaltic and basaltic andesite compositions, which coexist with granulitic residues at 8 kbar and eclogitic or garnet granulitic (garnet + clinopyroxene + plagioclase +/- orthopyroxene) residues at higher pressures (12-28 kbar). As much as 40{\%} by volume high-Al2O3 trondhjemitic-tonalitic liquid coexists with an eclogitic residue at 1100-1150 degrees C and 32 kbar. The experimental data suggest that the Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suite of rocks, and their Phanerozoic equivalents, the tonalite-trondhjemite-dacite suite (including 'adakites' and other Na-rich granitoids), can be generated by 10-40{\%} melting of partially hydrated metabasalt at pressures above the garnet-in phase boundary (greater than or equal to 12 kbar) and temperatures between 1000 and 1100 degrees C. Anomalously hot and/or thick metabasaltic crust is implied Although a rare occurrence along modern convergent plate margins, subduction-related melting of young, hot oceanic crust (e.g. ocean ridges) may have been an important (essential) element in the growth of the continental crust in the Archean, if plate tectonic processes were operative. Coupled silicic melt generation-segregation and mafic restite disposal may also occur at the base of continental or primitive (sub-arc?) crust, where crustal overthickening is a consequence of underplating and overaccretion of mafic magmas. In either setting, net growth of continental crust and crust-mantle recycling may be facilitated by relatively high degrees of melting and extreme density contrasts between trondhjemitic-tonalitic liquids and garnet-rich residues. Continuous chemical trends are apparent between the experimental crystalline residues, and mafic migmatites and garnet granulite xenoliths from the lower crust, although lower-crustal xenoliths in general record lower temperatures (600-900 degrees C) and pressures (5-13 kbar) than corresponding residual assemblages from the experiments However, geo-thermobarometry on eclogite xenoliths in kimberlites from the subcontinental mantle indicates conditions appropriate for melting through and beyond the amphibole reaction interval and the granulite-eclogite transition. If these samples represent ancient (eclogitized) remnants of subducted or otherwise foundered basaltic crust, then the intervening history of their protoliths may in some cases include partial melting.},

Agpaitic rocks are peralkaline nepheline syenites characterized by the presence of complex rare-element minerals such as eudialyte and mosandrite, instead of the simple minerals such as zircon and ilmenite. Uranium deposits have been found in agpaitic rocks in Brazil (Po??os de Caldas), China (Saima) and Greenland (Il??maussaq), Nb and apetite deposits in Russia (Lovozero and Khibina). The type locality of agpaitic rocks, the Il??maussaq complex in south Greenland, is characterized by elevated contents of elements such as Zr, REE, Y, Be, Li, Nb, U, Th and F, not only in pegmatites, late veins and contact fenites, but also in some of the rocks, especially lujavrite and kakortokite. The most important rare-element containing minerals are eudialyte (Zr, REE, Y, Nb), steenstrupine (U, Th, REE), rinkite (Nb, REE, Y, U), pyrochlore and perovskite (Nb, Ta), Li-mica (Li), chkalovite (Be) and villiaumite (F).

abstract = {The Maoniuping rare-earth-element (REE) deposit, hosted in a carbonatite-syenite complex, is the second largest light REE deposit in China. Fluorite is one of the main gangue minerals. Fluorites with different colors and REE patterns show uniform initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and epsilon(Nd) values, similar to carbonatite and syenite, and different from granite. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of early fluorite and quartz resemble those of carbonatite and syenite, but differ from those of granite and rhyolite. These indicate that the REE ore-forming fluids are closely related to carbonatite and syenite magmas. Because emplacement of the carbonatite was later than that of the syenite, early fluid carrying REE and fluoride mainly evolved from the syenite magma. Mixing of this fluid with a Ca-carbonatite-derived fluid was the major control of early fluorite deposition. With changes in temperature of the ore-forming fluids, REE mineral deposition occurred as a result of the decreased ligand concentration that accompanied massive later fluorite mineralization. The uniform isotope composition of fluorite, quartz, and carbonatite show that the REE ore-forming fluids were not contaminated by ground or meteoric water or by country-rock fluids.},

abstract = {Some scientists and journalists, and many members of the general public, have been led to believe that the world is rapidly running out of the metals on which our modern society is based. Advocates of the peak metal concept have predicted for many decades that increasing consumption will soon lead to exhaustion of mineral resources. Yet, despite ever-increasing production and consumption, supplies of minerals have continued to meet the needs of industry and society, and lifetimes of reserves remain similar to what they were 30-40 years ago. In this volume, we discuss the reasons for this apparent paradox using our broad experience and expertise on both academic and industrial sides of the minerals sector. Many misconceptions arise from flawed estimates of the size of global mineral resources which stem from a lack of understanding of the critical difference between reserves and resources. Some authors use quoted reserves – the amount of metal proven to exist and to be economic for mining at present – when predicting imminent shortages. Resources – the amount that may be accessible in the upper few kilometres of the crust – are far larger. Over the last 150 years, improved technologies, economies of scale and increased efficiency have combined to reduce costs hence allowing lower grade ore to be mined economically. The net result is that the long-term inflation-adjusted price of most metals has decreased more or less in parallel with increasing production, a second apparent paradox that frequently is not well understood. Using copper as the principal example and other metals as appropriate, we summarise the latest research on ore deposits and the activities of the minerals industry. Following a description of the numerous geological processes that form ore deposits, we outline the scientific methods used by the minerals industry to explore for new deposits. We also discuss how resources are mined and how minerals are processed, as well as recent efforts to reduce related environmental impacts. Economic and societal factors influence supply, and these are as important as the actual presence of a resource. Finally, we discuss the critical roles that geoscientists will play in assuring continued supplies of minerals. These include the development of new concepts and techniques that will assist the discovery, mining, processing, remediation, and management of mineral resources. It is essential that researchers help to educate the general public about the need for continued exploration to find new resources to meet world growth in living standards. We demonstrate that global resources of copper, and probably of most other metals, are much larger than most currently available estimates, especially if increasing efficiencies and higher prices allow lower-grade ores to be mined. These observations indicate that supplies of important mineral commodities will remain adequate for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {Zircon is an important host mineral for many high-field strength elements (HFSE), particularly Zr and Hf. Thus, its solubility in geologic fluids at high pressure and temperature plays an important role in terrestrial cycling of these elements during processes in the Earth's crust and mantle. We performed in-situ high-pressure, high-temperature measurements of zircon solubility in H2O–Na2Si3O7, H2O–Na2Si3O7+Al2O3, H2O–Na2Si2O5, H2O–NaAlSi3O8 fluids, as well as of baddeleyite solubility in H2O–NaOH fluids, by in-situ synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis using hydrothermal diamond-anvil cells. Zirconium complexation in fluids in equilibrium with zircon was constrained by in-situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Zircon solubility is strongly enhanced by addition of Na2Si3O7 to H2O. The degree of enhancement increases with Na2Si3O7 concentration. The Zr content of fluids containing 10 wt{\%} Na2Si3O7 reached up to 86±2 ppm Zr at 550 °C and 400 MPa. At 30 wt{\%} Na2Si3O7, the maximum Zr concentration was 997±6 ppm at 600 °C and 440 MPa. Zircon solubility in these fluids decreases considerably with pressure and increases slightly with temperature. Addition of Al2O3 decreases the zircon solubility. In H2O–NaAlSi3O8 fluids, the Zr concentrations are in the sub-ppm to ppm range. Zr concentrations in NaOH solutions in equilibrium with baddeleyite reached up to 390±2 ppm at 600 °C and 930 MPa and increase with pressure and temperature. In-situ XANES spectra collected on Zr in H2O–Na2Si3O7, H2O–Na2Si3O7+Al2O3, H2O–NaOH, and H2O–HCl fluids in equilibrium with zircon provide evidence for strong differences in the Zr complexation between these fluids. Comparison of XANES spectra to those of model compounds and ab-initio simulation of XANES spectra revealed [8]Zr for the HCl solution, [7]Zr for the NaOH solution, and [6]Zr for the Na–Al-silicate-bearing solutions. For the latter solutions, formation of alkali zircono-silicate complexes is indicated by the strong dependence of zircon solubility on Na/Al and the similarity of the XANES spectra to spectra simulated based on the local structure around Zr in the alkali zircono-silicates vlasovite and catapleite. Alkali zircono-silicate complexes are responsible for the enhancement of Zr concentrations in Na–Al-silicate-bearing solutions and very likely play an important role for mobilization of HFSE during fluid–rock interaction. Because high alkali/Al can be expected in aqueous fluids at high pressure and temperature due to incongruent dissolution of feldspar and mica, the increase of zircon solubility along the NaAlSi3O8–Na2Si3O7 join points to potentially considerable Zr or HFSE transport by silicate-bearing aqueous fluids in the lower crust and upper mantle.},

abstract = {Strongly peralkaline volcanic complexes tend to be shieldlike due to coalescence of low-viscosity lavas from numerous vent areas and blanketing by pyroclastic flows and falls. Dense welding and rheomorphism commonly mask the nature of pyroclastic units; welded pumice falls are common. Relatively low eruptive columns produce poorly sorted pumice falls that are difficult to distinguish from topography mantling pyroclastic flows. Welded fall deposits are characterized by multiple, fine-scale, welding reversals, welding zones that correspond with stratification, and by flattening of fiamme parallel to underlying slopes, whereas welded topography-mantling ignimbrites may have fine-grained basal layers, lithic lenses, imbricate fiamme, and variations in crystal content and fiamme size with topographic position. Calderas are relatively small, typically 3–9 km in diameter, with little evidence for single-stage subsidence in excess of a few hundred meters. Many strongly peralkaline volcanic centers show evidence of two or more nested calderas, and partial reactivation of older ring fractures is common. Replenishment of magma reservoirs beneath calderas can promote dilatant reactivation of older subsidence structures, resulting in multicyclic collapses that reuse these structures. In several centers, the caldera-forming unit is zoned from pantellerite to more crystal-rich trachyte. Following collapse, trachyte lavas commonly erupt from a central vent on the caldera floor, building a cone that nearly fills the caldera. Reestablishment of isostatic equilibrium may be accomplished both by eruption of these lavas and by flow of trachytic and more-mafic magma into the root zone beneath the volcano. Resurgent doming sensu strictu has not been documented in strongly peralkaline systems; at Pantelleria and Mount Suswa, however, the central portions of the cauldron blocks were uplifted and tilted. Magma reservoirs that feed explosive eruptions generally are shallow, as indicated by pyroclastic units that contain lithic fragments of the volcanic edifice (commonly including cognate syenite) but lack subjacent crustal lithologies. In addition, the overwhelming predominance of alkali feldspar as a phenocryst phase and the scarcity of quartz are consistent with pantellerite liquidus relations only at pressures {\textless}100 MPa. Pantellerite and trachyte shields may represent the mature stage of continental rift volcanism; once the flux of mantle-derived magmas has been sufficient to generate a large mass of felsic liquid that can act as a density filter, mafic magmas rarely reach the surface.},

abstract = {The Devonian (ca. 385-360Ma) Kola Alkaline Province includes 22 plutonic ultrabasic-alkaline complexes, some of which also contain carbonatites and rarely phoscorites. The latter are composite silicate-oxide-phosphate-carbonate rocks, occurring in close space-time genetic relations with various carbonatites. Several carbonatites types are recognized at Kola, including abundant calcite carbonatites (early- and late-stage), with subordinate amounts of late-stage dolomite carbonatites, and rarely magnesite, siderite and rhodochrosite carbonatites. In phoscorites and early-stage carbonatites the rare earth elements (REE) are distributed among the major minerals including calcite (up to 490ppm), apatite (up to 4400ppm in Kovdor and 3.5wt.{\%} REE2O3in Khibina), and dolomite (up to 77ppm), as well as accessory pyrochlore (up to 9.1wt.{\%} REE2O3) and zirconolite (up to 17.8wt.{\%} REE2O3). Late-stage carbonatites, at some localities, are strongly enriched in REE (up to 5.2wt.{\%} REE2O3in Khibina) and the REE are major components in diverse major and minor minerals such as burbankite, carbocernaite, Ca- and Ba-fluocarbonates, ancylite and others. The rare earth minerals form two distinct mineral assemblages: primary (crystallized from a melt or carbohydrothermal fluid) and secondary (formed during metasomatic replacement). Stable (C-O) and radiogenic (Sr-Nd) isotopes data indicate that the REE minerals and their host calcite and/or dolomite have crystallized from a melt derived from the same mantle source and are co-genetic.},

abstract = {We have experimentally investigated the phase and melting relations of garnet + clinopyroxene + carbonate assemblages at 2.5–5.5  GPa, to assess the feasibility of carbonated eclogite as a source for some crustally emplaced carbonatites. The solidus of our composition was at ap1,125 °C at 2.5 GPa, ap1,225 °C at 3.5 GPa and ap1,310 °C at 5.0 GPa. Melts were sodic calcio-dolomitic carbonatites, and were markedly more calcic than the dolomitic melts produced by partial melting of carbonated peridotite. Na contents of the experimental carbonatites decreased with increasing pressure when compared at similar degrees of melting, and SiO2 contents increased with degree of melting. Experiments on a second composition with enhanced Na2O demonstrated its strong effect in lowering melting temperatures in carbonate eclogite. Natural carbonated eclogite bodies in the peridotitic upper mantle will have a range of solidus temperatures. In many cases, carbonate will be molten in the upper ge250 km. Carbonate melt would segregate from its source eclogite at very low melt fractions and infiltrate surrounding peridotitic wall rock. This would result in metasomatic enrichment of the peridotitic wall rock, but its exact nature will depend on the relative P–T positions of the eclogite + CO2 and peridotite + CO2 solidii. As a result of these inevitable metasomatic interactions, it is considered unlikely that carbonatite melts derived from carbonated eclogite in the upper mantle could be emplaced into the crust unmodified. However, they may have a role in metasomatically enriching and carbonating parts of the upper mantle, producing sources suitable for subsequent production of silica undersaturated silicate liquids and carbonatites ultimately emplaced in the crust.},

abstract = {The rare earth elements (REE) have attracted much attention in recent years, being viewed as critical metals because of China?s domination of their supply chain. This is despite the fact that REE enrichments are known to exist in a wide range of settings, and have been the subject of much recent exploration. Although the REE are often referred to as a single group, in practice each individual element has a specific set of end-uses, and so demand varies between them. Future demand growth to 2026 is likely to be mainly linked to the use of NdFeB magnets, particularly in hybrid and electric vehicles and wind turbines, and in erbium-doped glass fiber for communications. Supply of lanthanum and cerium is forecast to exceed demand. There are several different types of natural (primary) REE resources, including those formed by high-temperature geological processes (carbonatites, alkaline rocks, vein and skarn deposits) and those formed by low-temperature processes (placers, laterites, bauxites and ion-adsorption clays). In this paper, we consider the balance of the individual REE in each deposit type and how that matches demand, and look at some of the issues associated with developing these deposits. This assessment and overview indicate that while each type of REE deposit has different advantages and disadvantages, light rare earth- enriched ion adsorption types appear to have the best match to future REE needs. Pro- duction of REE as by-products from, for example, bauxite or phosphate, is potentially the most rapid way to produce additional REE. There are still significant technical and eco- nomic challenges to be overcome to create substantial REE supply chains outside China.},

abstract = {There is a growing need for new zircon reference materials for in situ Hf-isotope analysis by laser ablation-multicollector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). In this contribution we document the results of a preliminary investigation of seven natural zircons, conducted in order to test their suitability in this regard. Solution MC-ICP-MS data on separated Lu and Hf fractions provided reference compositional data while the results of ca. 750 in situ LA-MC-ICP-MS analyses allowed assessment of potential micrometre-scale heterogeneity. On the basis of these analyses and additional relevant considerations such as availability, size and (Lu)Yb/Hf ratio, we suggest that, of the currently available zircons, Temora-2 and Mud Tank are most likely to provide robust reference materials for Hf isotope determinations both at the present time and into the future. The former has the advantage of also being well-characterised for U-Th-Pb systematics and suitable for in situ age determination, while the latter is the most readily available and is of very large grain size. Additional materials such as BR266, and 91500, although limited in supply, show more consistent Lu/Hf ratios and are thus of use in monitoring elemental fractionation during ICP-MS analysis.},

abstract = {Oceanic sediments deposited at high rate close to continents are dominated by terrigenous material. Aside from dilution by biogenic components, their chemical compositions reflect those of nearby continental masses. This study focuses on oceanic sediments coming from the juvenile Canadian Cordillera and highlights systematic differences between detritus deriving from juvenile crust and detritus from old and mature crust. We report major and trace element concentrations for 68 sediments from the northernmost part of the Cascade forearc, drilled at ODP Sites 888 and 1027. The calculated weighted averages for each site can then be used in the future to quantify the contribution of subducted sediments to Cascades volcanism. The two sites have similar compositions but Site 888, located closer to the continent, has higher sandy turbidite contents and displays higher bulk SiO2/Al2O3 with lower bulk Nb/Zr, attributed to the presence of zircons in the coarse sands. Comparison with published data for other oceanic sedimentary piles demonstrates the existence of systematic differences between modern sediments deriving from juvenile terranes (juvenile sediments) and modern sediments derived from mature continental areas (cratonic sediments). The most striking systematic difference is for Th/Nb, Th/U, Nb/U and Th/Rb ratios: juvenile sediments have much lower ratios than cratonic sediments. The small enrichment of Th over Nb in cratonic sediments may be explained by intracrustal magmatic and metamorphic differentiation processes. In contrast, their elevated Th/U and Nb/U ratios (average values of 6.87 and 7.95, respectively) in comparison to juvenile sediments (Th/U {\~{}} 3.09, Nb/U {\~{}} 5.15) suggest extensive U and Rb losses on old cratons. Uranium and Rb losses are attributed to long-term leaching by rain and river water during exposure of the continental crust at the surface. Over geological times, the weathering effects create a slow but systematic increase of Th/U with exposure time.},

abstract = {Re-Os data for peridotite xenoliths carried in Paleozoic kimberlites and Tertiary alkali basalts confirm previous suggestions that the refractory and chemically buoyant lithospheric keel present beneath the eastern block of the North China craton (and sampled by Paleozoic kimberlites) is indeed Archean in age and was replaced by more fertile lithospheric mantle sometime after the Paleozoic. Moreover, lithospheric mantle beneath the central portion of the craton (west of the major gravity lineament) formed during the last major Precambrian orogeny, around 1900 Ma ago. This age is significantly younger than the overlying crust (2700 Ma), suggesting that the original Archean lithosphere was replaced in the Proterozoic. The timing of lithospheric replacement in the eastern block of the North China Craton is constrained only to the Phanerozoic by the Re-Os results. Circumstantial geologic evidence suggests this new lithosphere is Jurassic or Cretaceous in age and formed after collision of the Yangtze and North China cratons in the Triassic, an event that was also responsible for the subduction and uplift of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks. Collectively, these data suggest that lithosphere replacement occurred in response to two continent collisional events widely separated in time (??? 1900 and ??? 220 Ma). Coupled with observations from other Archean cratons we suggest that wholesale replacement of lithospheric mantle (?? lower crust) may require large-scale continental collision. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A thermodynamic model has been used to quantify the effects of transport and deposition on the gold and silver contents, Ag/Au ratios and $\Sigma$CO2/$\Sigma$H2S ratios in boiling hydrothermal solutions. Boiling is singled out because the majority of the precious-metal vein deposits studied exhibit some evidence of two-phase behavior. Several hundred model calculations were carried out for the following conditions: T = 150–300°C, Cl− = 0.1 and 1.0 m, pH = 4–6, $\Sigma$H2S = 0.1–10−5 m, and $\Sigma$H2S/$\Sigma$SO4 = 10−109.

The transport calculations indicate that low Ag/Au ratios ({\textless}1) in solution result from conditions dominated by low temperature ({\textless}/250°C), low Cl− (0.1 m), moderate to high pH (⩾5) and $\Sigma$H2S (⩾10−3 m), and high $\Sigma$H2S/$\Sigma$SO4 ratios ({\textgreater}105). At these conditions, argentite is the most stable silver phase and gold is transported dominantly as Au(HS)2−. The AuCl2− complex dominates at high temperature (⩾250°C), high Cl− (1.0 m), low $\Sigma$H2S ({\textless}10−3 m), low to moderate pH (⩽5), and low $\Sigma$H2S/$\Sigma$SO4 ratios ({\textless}105). These conditions favor high Ag/Au ratios in solution ({\textgreater} 1) and generally native silver as the most stable silver phase. The overall frequency distribution of the Ag/Au ratios in solution exhibits many similarities with patterns given for natural epithermal vein deposits. Collectively, these distributions display a pronounced mode between Ag/Au values of 10 and 100.

The depth at which boiling commences becomes shallower with either decreasing temperature and/or CO2 concentration for a constant salinity. Solutions with the highest initial gas concentrations will tend to deposit gold and silver over the greatest vertical distances, and produce deposits with lower ore grades. The model also predicts the presence of more intense zones of gold and silver enrichment near the top of the boiling interval which may be analogous to the very high-grade bonanza ores observed in many precious metal vein deposits. However, the low magnitudes of these enrichments during a single boiling event suggest that many volumes of a boiling fluid passing through a given volume of rock are required in order for ore grades in the mineralized boiling zone to reach levels typical of most epithermal deposits.

During the boiling process, the Ag/au ratios remain relatively constant except near the top of the boiling interval where abrupt changes are observed. Significant increases in Ag/Au ratios are associated with systems that have moderate to high temperatures, high Cl−, low $\Sigma$H2S, low to moderate pH, and high $\Sigma$CO2/$\Sigma$H2S ratios. Conversely, a drop in the Ag/Au ratios near the top of the boiling zone accompanies systems with low temperature, low Cl−, moderate to high pH, high $\Sigma$H2S and low $\Sigma$CO2/$\Sigma$H2S ratios. The frequency distribution of the boiling Ag/Au ratios is very similar to both the transport histogram and the histograms for natural vein deposits. The Ag/Au mode of 10 to 100 is preserved, and the overall range of values is basically the same (10−3 to 103).},

abstract = {Pegmatites and adjacent subsolvus granites (two alkali feldspars) of the Mid-Proterozoic Strange Lake pluton (Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador, Canada) host potentially economic concentrations of high field strength elements (HFSE), including the rare earth elements (REE), zirconium and niobium. Previous studies have proposed that these concentrations were the result of a combination of extreme fractionation of a peralkaline granitic magma and later hydrothermal remobilization. However, the recent discovery of melt inclusions which, after heating to 900 or 950. °C, quench to immiscible fluoride and silicate glasses, suggests an additional mechanism of HFSE concentration.Crystallized melt inclusions are common in quartz phenocrysts of the early hypersolvus and transsolvus granite. After heating, four types of inclusions were discerned. Type 1 inclusions quench to a single silicate glass containing a high concentration of Zr, Nb and Ti. Quenching of Type 2 inclusions produces a Zr, Nb, Ti-rich silicate glass containing a globule of calcium-rich fluoride glass with a high concentration of the REE. The third inclusion type is similar to Type 2, except that the calcium-rich fluoride glass contains a globule of REE-fluoride glass (up to 50. wt.{\%} total REE). Type 4 inclusions contain calcium-fluoride glass with multiple silicate globules.We propose that during or soon after emplacement, the early granitic magma exsolved a calcium fluoride melt into which rare earth elements (REE) partitioned preferentially. The conjugate silicate melt was consequently depleted in Ca and the REE, and enriched in Zr, Nb and Ti. Crystallization of the fluoride melt occurred late in the crystallization history of the silicate magma allowing it to accumulate in the volatile-rich residual magma that formed the pegmatites. This played a major role in the extreme enrichment of the pegmatites in Ca, F and REE. Crystallization of the pegmatites proceeded inwards from an outer zone in which feldspars, quartz, arfvedsonite and zirconosilicate minerals dominate to a core where the immiscible fluoride liquid collected and crystallized fluorite and REE minerals. Fluid exsolved from the silicate melt reacted with the products of both the silicate and fluoride melts, remobilizing most of the HFSE including the REE. This study reports a rare example of silicate-fluoride melt immiscibility and the first in which such immiscibility played a role in concentrating the REE to potentially economic levels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements have been performed on three different Er-doped glasses: silica and sodium silicate doped with Er in the molten phase, and silica doped by MeV ion implantation. All samples show a luminescent transition centered around a wavelength of $\lambda$ = 1.54 $\mu$m, corresponding to an intra-4f transition of Er3+. EXAFS data show that the Er ions have about six O first neighbors, at a distance of 2.26 {\AA} in all systems. Both silica glasses show a second-neighbor ErSi shell at 3.11 {\AA} which is not seen in the sodium silicate glass. This difference is reflected in a difference in the PL spectra. The ErO shell in the silica glass shows 0.01 {\AA}2 more disorder than that in the Na-loaded material. These findings are rationalized in terms of the network-modifying effect of Na. Both EXAFS and PL show no significant differences between silica samples prepared in the molten phase or by implantation. At an Er concentration of ∼1 at.{\%}, no direct ErEr bonds are observed.},

abstract = {We have performed phase equilibrium experiments to determine the pre-eruptive conditions of the largest caldera-forming eruption (∼ 20 km3 of DRE) that has occurred on Tenerife (Canary Islands). The Abrigo ignimbrite is phonolitic and was erupted during the last caldera-forming episode (ca. 190 ka), prior to the construction of the Teide-Pico Viejo active central complex. The Abrigo phonolite contains low amounts of phenocrysts (ca. 7 vol.{\%}), mainly sanidine, biotite, clinopyroxene, and magnetite, with minor amounts of titanite, apatite, and ha{\"{u}}yne. We have investigated pressures from 50 to 250 MPa, temperatures of 700-900 °C, water contents in the melt from 1.5 to ca. 10 wt.{\%}, and oxygen fugacity (fO2) from 1 log unit above the Ni-NiO solid buffer to Quartz-Magnetite-Fayalite. Comparison of the natural and experimental phase proportions and compositions indicates that the phonolite at the roof of the Abrigo magma reservoir was at 130 ± 50 MPa (corresponding to ca. 4-5 km below the surface), 825 ± 25 °C, with 3 ± 1 wt.{\%} dissolved H2O and fO2 at the Ni-NiO buffer ± 1 log unit. This shows that the magma that produced the largest ignimbrite on Tenerife was stored at relatively shallow depths but was water-undersaturated, and its eruption was probably triggered by input of fresh mafic magma. Comparison of the Abrigo phase equilibrium results with those obtained in other phonolitic magmas (e.g., Eifel, Kerguelen, Somma-Vesuvius) shows that the major element and probably fluid composition (H2O, Cl and S) may have a strong effect on the presence or absence of phases and their compositions. Extrapolating phase equilibria results obtained on a specific phonolite to constrain the pre-eruptive conditions of other phonolites should be done with care. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigated phase equilibria in the six-component system Na2O–K2O–Al2O3–SiO2–F2O−1–H2O at 100 MPa to characterize differentiation paths of natural fluorine-bearing granitic and rhyolitic magmas. Topaz and cryolite are stable saturating solid phases in calcium-poor systems. At 100 MPa the maximum solidus depression and fluorine solubility in evolving silicic melts are controlled by the eutectics haplogranite–cryolite–H2O at 640°C and ∼4 wt {\%} F, and haplogranite–topaz–H2O at 640°C and ∼2 wt {\%} F. Topaz and cryolite form a binary peralkaline eutectic at 660°C, 100 MPa and fluid saturation. The low-temperature nature of this invariant point causes displacement of multiphase eutectics with quartz and alkali feldspar towards the topaz–cryolite join and enables the silicate liquidus and cotectic surfaces to extend to very high fluorine concentrations (more than 30 wt {\%} F) for weakly peraluminous and subaluminous compositions. The differentiation of fluorine-bearing magmas follows two distinct paths of fluorine behavior, depending on whether additional minerals buffer the alkali/alumina ratio in the melt. In systems with micas or aluminosilicates that buffer the activity of alumina, magmatic crystallization will reach either topaz or cryolite saturation and the system solidifies at low fluorine concentration. In leucogranitic suites precipitating quartz and feldspar only, the liquid line of descent will reach topaz or cryolite but fluorine will continue to increase until the quaternary eutectic with two fluorine-bearing solid phases is reached at 540°C, 100 MPa and aqueous-fluid saturation. The maximum water solubility in the haplogranitic melts increases with the fluorine content and reaches ∼12{\textperiodcentered} 5 ± 0{\textperiodcentered} 5 wt {\%} H2O at the quartz–cryolite–topaz eutectic composition. A continuous transition between hydrous fluorosilicate melts and solute-rich aqueous fluids is not documented by this study. Our experimental results are applicable to leucocratic fluorosilicic magmas. In multicomponent systems, however, the presence of calcium may severely limit enrichment of fluorine by crystallization of fluorite.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic was an era of great environmental and biological change, but a paucity of direct and precise age constraints on strata from this time has prevented the complete integration of these records. We present four high-precision U-Pb ages for Neoproterozoic rocks in northwestern Canada that constrain large perturbations in the carbon cycle, a major diversification and depletion in the microfossil record, and the onset of the Sturtian glaciation. A volcanic tuff interbedded with Sturtian glacial deposits, dated at 716.5 million years ago, is synchronous with the age of the Franklin large igneous province and paleomagnetic poles that pin Laurentia to an equatorial position. Ice was therefore grounded below sea level at very low paleolatitudes, which implies that the Sturtian glaciation was global in extent.},

abstract = {The agpaitic nepheline syenites of the Nechalacho Layered Suite represent the youngest intrusive phase of the Blatchford Lake Igneous Complex, Canada, and host hydrothermally altered eudialyte-rich layers that constitute one of the world's largest rare earth element (REE) and niobium deposits. Three distinct peripheral rare metal pegmatites, the T-, R- and S-Zones, contain high-grade Li, Be, REE and Nb deposits. Based on stable and radiogenic isotope data, we constrain the age of the Nechalacho Layered Suite, identify its magmatic source and interpret the hydrothermal alteration that modified the ore and gangue mineralogy. In situ Laser ICP-MS U-Pb dating of igneous zircon yielded a concordia age of 2176.0 ± 2.7 Ma for the Nechalacho Layered Suite. Initial $\epsilon$Nd2176 Ma between 1.1 and 3.0 and averaging 2.0 indicates a derivation from mantle magma that was isotopically similar to modern ocean island basalt. The $\delta$18Omelt values calculated for magmatic aegirine, annite and zircon at 700 °C range from 5.1 to 7.8‰; $\delta$Dmelt is − 60‰. For the earlier alkaline granite and quartz syenites of the Blatchford Lake Igneous Complex (Grace Lake Granite, Thor Lake Syenite, Rim Syenite), $\delta$18Omelt calculated for fayalite, riebeckite, richterite and quartz ranges from 6.7 to 8.1‰ and $\delta$Dmelt from − 99 to − 93‰. Together with the Nd isotope ratios, this indicates a common, deep-seated feeder system of mantle magma that evolved rapidly to generate granites, quartz syenites, and finally nepheline syenites, with little or no crustal contamination. The Nechalacho Layered Suite exsolved a late-magmatic aqueous-carbonic fluid that caused auto-metasomatism associated with ankerite-bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) mineralization, producing hydrothermal carbonates with $\delta$13C from − 6.3 to − 2.7‰ and $\delta$18O from 11.3 to 15.0‰. Similar ratios previously reported for ankerite from the T-Zone demonstrate a genetic link to the pegmatites at the magmatic-hydrothermal interface. Hydrothermal monazite-(Ce) from the Basal Zone of the Nechalacho deposit yielded a U-Pb concordia age of 1871 ± 14 Ma and 208Pb/232Th ages of 1852 ± 14, 1835 ± 57 and 1854 ± 27 Ma. This indicates monazite formation during a late regional hydrothermal event associated with faulting and emplacement of the Compton Intrusive Suite along the southern margin of the Slave Craton. The temperature determined for this late overprint using oxygen isotopes of quartz and magnetite is {\~{}} 300 °C and the fluids had $\delta$18OH2O of 3.1–9.3‰ and $\delta$D of − 24‰, indicating the presence of a regionally pervasive amagmatic crustal fluid.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the mineral resource definitions from the exploration boom that followed the rare earth element (REE) price peak of 2011, and finds that 1. the delineated REE mineral resources outside of China reached a total of 98 Mt contained total rare earth oxides in 2015 with the majority located in Canada (38 Mt), Greenland (39 Mt) and Africa (10.3 Mt), representing a fivefold increase between 2010 (16.5 Mt combined) and 2015 (87.3 Mt combined).2. a large portion of these resources contain REE bearing silicates as dominant ore mineral which have a higher heavy REE to light REE ratio than conventional carbonate-mineral REE resources.The results highlight effective, stock market-financed exploration by junior companies and demonstrate REE resource availability outside of China. However, at current low prices, challenges to transform these resources from exploration to mining projects remain. These are tied to the up-scaling of beneficiation technologies for unconventional REE ore minerals and to raising investment for project implementation. In this context, we contend that the successful delineation of these REE resources provide abundant options for expansion and investment in the REE industry which are most likely harnessed by the dominant REE market player, China. Concerns about China's dominant role are therefore likely to persist.},

abstract = {An intimate physical and chemical interplay between crystals and melt in magmatic systems gives rise to a vast diversity of igneous rocks and the very structure of terrestrial planets. Yet the actual physical means by which this happens is unclear. The long-standing notion of crystals nucleating, growing, and settling ad infinitum from the interior of large pools of magma to eventually form continental rocks is foundering. Processes operating at the smallest scales within marginal solidification fronts and in mingling crystal slurries throughout highly integrated, vertically extended mush columns give rise to planetary-scale effects.},

abstract = {The results of isotope-geochronological and mineralogical studies of the rocks making up the Kizilca{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}ren fluorite-barite-REE deposit, northwestern Anatolia, Turkey are discussed in the paper. The ore is a constituent of the subvolcanic complex localized in a large fault zone. The complex combines (from earlier to later rocks): (1) phonolite and trachyte stocks, (2) carbonatite and carbonate-silicate dikelike bodies; and (3) fluorite-barite-bastnaesite ore in the form of thick homogeneous veins and cement in breccia. The K-Ar dating of silicate igneous rocks and carbonatites shows that they were formed in the Chattian Age of the Oligocene 25-24 Ma ago. Mineralogical observations show that the ore is the youngest constituent in the rock complex. Supergene alteration deeply transformed ore-bearing rocks, in particular, resulting in leaching of primary minerals, presumably Ca-Mn-Fe carbonates, and in cementation of the residual bastnaesitefluorite framework by Fe and Mn hydroxides. Most of the studied rocks contain pyrochlore, LREE fluorocarbonates, Nb-bearing rutile, Fe-Mg micas, and K-feldspar. The genetic features of the deposit have been considered. In general, the ore-bearing rock complex is compared in the set of rocks and their mineralogy and geochemistry with deposits of the Gallinas Mountains in the United States, the Arshan and Khalyuta deposits in the western Transbaikalia region, and Mushugai-Khuduk deposit in Mongolia. The Kizilca{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}ren deposit represents a variant of postmagmatic mineralization closely related to carbonatite magmatism associated with alkaline and subalkaline intermediate rocks. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the origin and evolution of fluid inclusions in ultramafic xenoliths, providing a framework for interpreting the chemistry of mantle fluids in the different geodynamic settings. Fluid inclusion data show that in the shallow mantle, at depths below about 100 km, the dominant fluid phase is CO2 ± brines, changing to alkali-, carbonate-rich (silicate) melts at higher pressures. Major solutes in aqueous fluids are chlorides, silica and alkalis (saline brines; 5-50 wt.{\%} NaCl eq.). Fluid inclusions in peridotites record CO2 fluxing from reacting metasomatic carbonate-rich melts at high pressures, and suggest significant upper-mantle carbon outgassing over time. Mantle-derived CO2 (±brines) may eventually reach upper-crustal levels, including the atmosphere, independently from, and additionally to magma degassing in active volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2014, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

abstract = {The strongly peralkaline Green Tuff, Pantelleria, is an example of a thin, densely welded air-fall tuff which mantles an area of at least 85 km2. Offshore the tuff is correlated with the Y-6 ash layer in the central Mediterranean Sea, and the total volume of the eruption is estimated at 7 km3 D.R.E. New petrological data suggests that the tuff was erupted from a zoned magma chamber containing a cooler, more fractionated upper zone relative to be bulk of the magma. Analysis of the distribution of accessory lithic fragments in terms of existing models of eruption dynamics indicates emplacement by a plinian-type eruption. It is shown that, due to the low viscosity of pantelleritic ejecta, dense welding can occur at moderate tephra accumulation rates and a rate of the order of 1 cm/minute is suggested for the Green Tuff; this yields an estimate for the eruption duration of rather less than one day. It is predicted that welded tuff should be formed during large plinian eruptions of pantelleritic magma, and therefore that welded airfall tuffs should be common in areas of peralkaline volcanism.},

Here we report on a new discovery, that isotopic substitution can fundamentally alter the nature of chemical bonding. This is established by systematic, rigorous quantum chemistry calculations of the isotopomers BrLBr, where L is an isotope of hydrogen. All the heavier isotopomers of BrHBr, BrDBr, BrTBr, and Br4HBr, the latter indicating the muonic He atom, the heaviest isotope of H, can only be stabilized as van der Waals bound states. In contrast, the lightest isotopomer, BrMuBr, with Mu the muonium atom, alone exhibits vibrational bonding, in accord with its possible observation in a recent experiment on the Mu+Br2 reaction. Accordingly, BrMuBr is stabilized at the saddle point of the potential energy surface due to a net decrease in vibrational zero point energy that overcompensates the increase in potential energy.},

abstract = {Teleseismic tomography is now widely recognised as a very powerful tool for studying the velocity structure of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system on both local and regional scales. A prime objective is to identify velocity perturbations and to constrain their location and intensity. Here we use the arrival times of P-waves from teleseismic events, recorded by a dense network of mobile and permanent stations within the French Massif Central, to derive a 3D P-velocity model for an area of 425 km × 300 km. Combined with knowledge of the basement geology of the area and the timing and geochemical characteristics of Tertiary-Quaternary volcanic activity, we consider that the velocity model provides unequivocal evidence for the ascent of a thermally and chemically anomalous mantle plume beneath the Massif Central during Tertiary times. Our model is consistent with regional Bouger gravity anomalies, documented patterns of Neogene-Recent uplift and deformation fabrics within lithosphere-derived mantle xenoliths exhumed by the volcanics.},

abstract = {Oceanic plateaus form by mantle processes distinct from those forming oceanic crust at divergent plate boundaries. Eleven drillsites into igneous basement of Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge, including seven from the recent Ocean Drilling Program Leg 183 (1998–99) and four from Legs 119 and 120 (1987–88), show that the dominant rocks are basalts with geochemical characteristics distinct from those of mid-ocean ridge basalts. Moreover, the physical characteristics of the lava flows and the presence of wood fragments, charcoal, pollen, spores and seeds in the shallow water sediments overlying the igneous basement show that the growth rate of the plateau was sufficient to form subaerial landmasses. Most of the southern Kerguelen Plateau formed at ∼110 Ma, but the uppermost submarine lavas in the northern Kerguelen Plateau erupted during Cenozoic time. These results are consistent with derivation of the plateau by partial melting of the Kerguelen plume. Leg 183 provided two new major observations about the final growth stages of the Kerguelen Plateau. 1: At several locations, volcanism ended with explosive eruptions of volatile-rich, felsic magmas; although the total volume of felsic volcanic rocks is poorly constrained, the explosive nature of the eruptions may have resulted in globally significant effects on climate and atmospheric chemistry during the late-stage, subaerial growth of the Kerguelen Plateau. 2: At one drillsite, clasts of garnet–biotite gneiss, a continental rock, occur in a fluvial conglomerate intercalated within basaltic flows. Previously, geochemical and geophysical evidence has been used to infer continental lithospheric components within this large igneous province. A continental geochemical signature in an oceanic setting may represent deeply recycled crust incorporated into the Kerguelen plume or continental fragments dispersed during initial formation of the Indian Ocean during breakup of Gondwana. The clasts of garnet–biotite gneiss are the first unequivocal evidence of continental crust in this oceanic plateau. We propose that during initial breakup between India and Antarctica, the spreading center jumped northwards transferring slivers of the continental Indian plate to oceanic portions of the Antarctic plate.},

The fO2 was probably close to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz solid buffer judging from results of other experimental studies. These conditions constrain the magma storage depth at about 5 ± 1 km below current summit of Teide volcano. Given that the island has not suffered any major structural or topographic changes since the Lavas Negras eruption, any remaining magma from this event should still be stored at such depth and probably with a similar thermal and rheological state.},

abstract = {The ultramafic–mafic Kharaelakh intrusion in the northwestern part of the Siberian Craton (Russia) hosts major economic platinum-group-element (PGE)–Cu–Ni sulphide deposits. In situ U–Pb, REE and Hf-isotope analyses of zircon from these rocks, combined with detailed study of crystal morphology and internal structure, identify four zircon populations. U–Pb ages of these populations cover a significant time span (from 347 ± 16 to 235.7 ± 6.1 Ma) suggesting multiple magmatic events that cluster around 350 and 250 Ma, being consistent with two recognised stages of active tectonism in the development of the Siberian Craton. The oldest zircon population, however, represents previously unknown stage of magmatic activity in the Noril'sk area. Epsilon-Hf values of +2.3 to +16.3 in the analysed zircons reflect a dominant role of mantle-derived magmas and suggest that juvenile mantle material was the main source for the ultramafic–mafic Kharaelakh intrusion. A significant range in initial 176Hf/177Hf values, found in zircons that cluster around 250 Ma, indicate mixing between mantle and crustal magma sources. Our findings imply that economic intrusions hosting PGE–Cu–Ni deposits of the Noril'sk area have a far more complex geological history than is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {The Lewisian Gneiss Complex of NW Scotland represents the eastern margin of the North Atlantic Craton. It comprises mid-late Archaean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite gneisses that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Late-Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic. A major swarm of mafic-ultramafic dykes, the Scourie Dyke Swarm, was intruded at ca. 2.4-2.3. Ga during a period of extension that can be correlated across the North Atlantic Craton. The majority of dykes are doleritic, with volumetrically minor picrite and olivine gabbro suites. New major and trace element geochemical data and Re-Os isotopes indicate that the Scourie Dyke Swarm was not solely derived from a 'typical' asthenospheric mantle source region. The geochemical signatures of the dykes show significant negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, coupled with enrichment in Th, Light Rare Earth Elements and other large ion lithophile elements. These features cannot be reproduced by simple contamination of asthenospheric sources with Lewisian granulite-facies crust. Instead they are a feature of the mantle source that produced the Scourie Dykes and may have developed during Archaean subduction episodes. Spinel lherzolite mantle xenoliths from the Isle of Lewis offer direct insight into the lithospheric mantle below this region. They display similar geochemical 'enrichments' and 'depletions' observed in the Scourie Dykes and the magma source is thus considered to reside primarily in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), with some potential contribution from asthenospheric melts. Platinum Group Element geochemistry and trace element modelling indicate that the dolerite dykes were formed by moderate ({\textless}15{\%}) partial melting of the source, whilst higher degrees of partial melting led to the formation of picritic and olivine gabbro suites. Magma production was triggered by significant crustal and lithospheric extension, causing both asthenospheric and substantial lithospheric melting. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We have carried out a Pb double-spike and Lu-Hf isotope study of clinopyroxenes from spinel-facies mantle xenoliths entrained in Cenozoic intraplate continental volcanism of the French Massif Central (FMC). U-Th-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope systematics verify the existence of different lithospheric domains beneath the northern and southern FMC. Northern FMC clinopyroxenes have extreme Lu/Hf ratios and ultra-radiogenic Hf (??Hf = +39.6 to +2586) that reflect ???15-25{\%} partial melting in Variscan times (depleted mantle model ages ???360 Ma). Zr, Hf and Th abundances in these clinopyroxenes are low and unaffected by hydrous/carbonatitic metasomatism that overprinted LILE and light REE abundances and caused decoupling of Lu/Hf-Sm/Nd ratios and Nd-Hf isotopes (??Nd = +2.1 to +91.2). Pb isotopes of northern FMC clinopyroxenes are radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb {\textgreater} 19), and typically more so than the host intraplate volcanic rocks. 238U/204Pb ratios range from 17 to 68, and most samples have distinctively low 232Th/238U ({\textless}1) and 232Th/204Pb (3-22). Clinopyroxenes from southern FMC lherzolites are generally marked by overall incompatible trace element enrichment including Zr, Hf and Th abundances, and have Pb isotopes that are similar to or less radiogenic than the host volcanic rocks. Hf isotope ratios are less radiogenic (??Hf = +5.4 to +41.5) than northern FMC mantle and have been overprinted by silicate-melt-dominated metasomatism that affected this part of FMC mantle. Major element and Lu concentrations of clinopyroxenes from southern FMC harzburgites are broadly similar to northern FMC clinopyroxenes and suggest they experienced similar degrees of melt extraction as northern FMC mantle. 238U/204Pb (53-111) and 232Th/204Pb ratios (157-355) of enriched clinopyroxenes from the southern FMC are extreme and significantly higher than the intraplate volcanic rocks. In summary, mantle peridotites from different parts of the FMC record depletion at ???360 Ma during Variscan subduction, followed by differing styles of enrichment. Northern FMC mantle was overprinted by a fluid/carbonatitic metasomatic agent that carried elements like U, Pb, Sr and light REE. In contrast, much of the southern FMC mantle was metasomatised by a small-degree partial silicate melt resulting in enrichment of all incompatible trace elements. The extreme mantle 238U/204Pb (northern and southern FMC), 232Th/238U (northern FMC) and 232Th/204Pb ratios (southern FMC), coupled with unremarkable present-day Pb isotope ratios, constrain the timing of enrichment. Mantle metasomatism is a young feature related to melting of the upwelling mantle responsible for Cenozoic FMC volcanism, rather than subduction-related metasomatism intimately associated with mantle depletion during the Variscan orogeny. The varying metasomatic styles relate to pre-existing variations in the thickness of the continental lithospheric lid, which controlled the extent to which upwelling mantle could ascend and melt. In the northern FMC, a thicker and more refractory lithospheric lid (???80 km) only allowed incipient degrees of melting resulting in fluid/carbonatitic metasomatism of the overlying sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The thinner lithospheric lid of the southern FMC (???70 km) allowed larger degrees of melting and resulted in silicate-melt-dominated metasomatism, and also focused the location of the volcanic fields of the FMC above this region. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Widespread basic magmatism across much of the western United States in the late Cenozoic followed the cessation of subduction along the Pacific coast. This volcanism accompanied lithospheric extension, block faulting and regional uplift. In an attempt to assess the relative contribution of asthenosphere and mantle lithosphere to magmas across the western United States we have analyzed, for major and trace elements, a suite of 750 basic (MgO {\textgreater} 4{\%}) lava samples from all the major volcanic fields in the region. The data were divided into seven sets representing the main tectonomagmatic provinces: Basin and Range (BR), Western Great Basin, Transition Zone (TZ), Colorado Plateau, Snake River Plain, Southern Rocky Mountains, and Great Plains. It was further divided into relatively recent ({\textless} 5 Ma) and older ({\textgreater} 5 Ma) subsets on the basis of field relations and K-Ar data. The {\textless} 5 Ma subset shows striking chemical differences between the provinces. All the BR lavas and some of the TZ lavas are indistinguishable from ocean island basalt (OIB) and therefore appear to have a source within the asthenosphere. In contrast, lavas from the other provinces generally show enrichments in Ba and depletions in Nb and Ti compared to OIB. This is accompanied by higher Sr-87/Sr-86 and lower Nd-143/Nd-144 than in the BR lavas. The older ({\textgreater} 5 Ma) subset shows no great differences between the BR and the other tectonomagmatic provinces; all have high La/Nb and Ba/Nb. Crustal contamination alone cannot be responsible for these variations. We conclude that many of the magmas have inherited their chemical and isotopic characteristics from a lithospheric mantle source enriched by fluids expelled from a subducted slab. Pelagic sediment, returned to the mantle by subduction, is a possible agent for fluids rich in Ba, radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd, but very poor in Nb. At least some of this enrichment must have accompanied the formation of the Proterozoic crust. It appears that subduction-enriched lithospheric mantle was involved in the generation of all extension-related basic magmas across the western United States until relatively recently. Only in the younger BR and parts of the TZ have asthenosphere-derived magmas, uncontaminated by lithosphere, reached the surface. These observations conflict with models in which uplift and extension are caused by the replacement of mantle lithosphere by asthenosphere. They are best explained by the progressive erosion of the lithospheric mantle over a plume currently located beneath the Southern Rocky Mountains.},

abstract = {Lead isotopic data of alkaline volcanic rocks and carbonatites from the Kaiserstuhl are presented in combination with Sr isotopic ratios. As a whole the initial lead ratios cover the range typical for other Tertiary to Recent alkaline rock provinces in Europe: Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.9-19.7, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.61-15.70 and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.7-39.7. Especially in the Pb-208/Pb204 vs. Pb-206/Pb-204 diagram the data reveal a linear array which is interpreted in terms of mixing of two mantle components. In detail the data comprise three distinct groups which are correlated with different magmatic rock types: unfractionated primary mantle melts (olivine nephelinites, olivine melilitites), fractionated alkaline rocks (tephrites, phonolites), and a group with carbonatites, bergalites and hauynophyres. These results are interpreted to reflect either derivation from different mantle sources, or the data trace a mixing line between two mantle reservoirs, one of them being more enriched. Contamination with crustal lead is unlikely: it may have affected the tephritic magma series, but not the carbonatitic rocks. The uppermost part of the updomed mantle beneath the Kaiserstuhl, which is known by petrographic evidence to be partially metasomatized, probably is the site of the enriched reservoir. A "plume"-like structure within the deeper mantle is suggested as the initial source of this mechanism.},

abstract = {The rare earth elements are unusual when defining giant-sized ore deposits, as resources are often quoted as total rare earth oxide, but the importance of a deposit may be related to the grade for individual, or a limited group of the elements. Taking the total REE resource, only one currently known deposit (Bayan Obo) would class as giant ({\textgreater}1.7 ?? 107 tonnes contained metal), but a range of others classify as large ({\textgreater}1.7 ?? 106 tonnes). With the exception of unclassified resource estimates from the Olympic Dam IOCG deposit, all of these deposits are related to alkaline igneous activity - either carbonatites or agpaitic nepheline syenites. The total resource in these deposits must relate to the scale of the primary igneous source, but the grade is a complex function of igneous source, magmatic crystallisation, hydrothermal modification and supergene enrichment during weathering. Isotopic data suggest that the sources conducive to the formation of large REE deposits are developed in subcontinental lithospheric mantle, enriched in trace elements either by plume activity, or by previous subduction. The reactivation of such enriched mantle domains in relatively restricted geographical areas may have played a role in the formation of some of the largest deposits (e.g. Bayan Obo). Hydrothermal activity involving fluids from magmatic to meteoric sources may result in the redistribution of the REE and increases in grade, depending on primary mineralogy and the availability of ligands. Weathering and supergene enrichment of carbonatite has played a role in the formation of the highest grade deposits at Mount Weld (Australia) and Tomtor (Russia). For the individual REE with the current highest economic value (Nd and the HREE), the boundaries for the large and giant size classes are two orders of magnitude lower, and deposits enriched in these metals (agpaitic systems, ion absorption deposits) may have significant economic impact in the near future.},

The rapid termination would have resulted in a warming of the snowball Earth to extreme greenhouse conditions. The transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean would result in the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate in warm surface waters, producing the cap carbonate rocks observed globally.},

abstract = {Alkaline igneous complexes host deposits of rare earth elements (REE), which represent one of the most economically important resources of heavy REE and Yttrium (Y). The hosts are differentiated rocks ranging from nepheline syenites and trachytes to peralkaline granites. These complexes usually occur in continental within-plate tectonic settings associated with rifts, faults, or hotspot magmatism. The REE mineralization is found in layered alkaline complexes, granitic stocks, and late-stages dikes and rarely trachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits. The bulk of REE is present in accessory minerals, which can reach percentage levels in mineralized zones. The mineralization contains various REE-bearing minerals that can display complex replacement textures. Main REE minerals present in these deposits are bastn{\"{a}}site, eudialyte, loparite, gittinsite, xenotime, monazite, zircon, and fergusonite. The parent magmas of alkaline igneous complexes are derived from partial melts of mantle sources. Protracted fractional crystallization of the magma led to an enrichment in REE, particularly in the late stages of magma evolution. The primary magmatic mineralization is commonly overprinted (remobilized and enriched) by late magmatic to hydrothermal fluids. Elevated abundances of U and Th in the deposits make a gamma-ray (radiometric) survey an important exploration tool, but also represent a significant environmental challenge for exploitation.},

abstract = {The partitioning of trace elements between crystals and melts provides an important petrogenetic tool for understanding magmatic processes. We present trace element partition coefficients measured between clinopyroxene phenocrysts and trachy-phonolitic magmas at the Campi Flegrei (Italy), whose late Quaternary volcanism has been characterized by two major caldera-forming events (Campanian Ignimbrite at {\~{}} 39 ka, and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff at {\~{}} 15 ka). Our data indicate that the increase of trivalent rare earth elements and yttrium into the crystal lattice M2 site is facilitated by the charge-balancing substitution of Si4 + with Al3 + on the tetrahedral site. Higher concentrations of tetravalent and pentavalent high field strength elements on the M1 site are also measured when the average charge on this site is increased by the substitution of divalent cations by Alvi. In contrast, due to these charge balance requirements, divalent transitional elements become less compatible within the crystal lattice. On the basis of the lattice strain theory, we document that the incorporation of rare earth elements and yttrium in clinopyroxene is influenced by both compositional and physical parameters. Data from this study allow to update existing partitioning equations for rare earth elements in order to construct a self-consistent model for trachy-phonolitic magmas based on the lattice strain theory. The application of this model to natural products from the Campanian Ignimbrite, the largest caldera-forming eruption at the Campi Flegrei, reveals that the complex rare earth element pattern recorded by the eruptive products can be successfully described by the stepwise fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene and feldspar where the clinopyroxene–melt partition coefficient changes progressively as a function of the physicochemical conditions of the system.},

abstract = {Paresis is one of a group of Cretaceous ring complexes extending from the coast some 350 km NE across the Damara Belt. It consists of over 90{\%} rhyolites and comendites, with subordinate intrusions of quartz syenite and alkali-feldspar syenite. These felsic units are accompanied by very minor amounts of silica-undersaturated basalt, phonolite and lamprophyre. Located near the edge of the Congo Craton, Paresis is the farthest inland of any felsic complex in the Cretaceous ring complex group. The other ring complexes in the vicinity consist of carbonatites and undersaturated alkaline rocks (e.g., Okorusu, Kalkfeld, Etaneno, Ondurakorume). Geochemical and isotopic data provide evidence for both mantle and crustal components in the sources of the Paresis magmas. The alkaline basalts, phonolite and lamprophyre have overlapping Sr and Nd isotopic initial ratios which plot within the mantle array close to bulk-earth values ($\epsilon$Nd=−0.9 to −2.8 and 87Sr/86Sr(i)=0.7042–0.7054) and may indicate a mantle plume component. The rhyolite units comprise metaluminous feldspar rhyolites and peraluminous, more differentiated quartz-feldspar rhyolites. Both units show prominent negative Nb and Ta anomalies on mantle-normalized multielement diagrams and have extremely nonradiogenic Nd ratios ($\epsilon$Nd=−21) and Sr initial ratios of 0.7117–0.7138. These isotopic values suggest a crustal origin from pre-Damara (Early Precambrian) gneisses and granitoids, which are exposed in the Congo craton and related inliers in northern Namibia. The comendites are peralkaline, highly differentiated rocks. In contrast to the rhyolites, comendites lack mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies, have higher HFSE and LREE contents, extreme negative Eu anomalies and $\epsilon$Nd values of −11. Like the comendites, alkali-feldspar syenites are peralkaline, lack Nb and Ta anomalies, have negative Eu anomalies and high HFSE concentrations. Their $\epsilon$Nd values are −6.5 to −8. The quartz syenites overlap with the peralkaline units in isotopic composition but they are chemically very different. They are metaluminous, have a low degree of differentiation and have prominent negative mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies like the rhyolites. The Sr–Nd isotopic composition and incompatible element ratios of the comendites, quartz syenites and alkali-feldspar syenites are intermediate between those of the rhyolites and basalts, precluding a simple origin by basalt fractionation or crustal melting. Instead, the data indicate that the comendite and syenites formed from hybrid magmas with both crustal and mantle-derived components. The metaluminous quartz syenites can be modelled by assimilation of pre-Damara crust by basaltic magma. The peralkaline nature and trace element characteristics of comendite and alkali-feldspar syenites, on the other hand, require an alkaline and HFSE-enriched basic endmember, whose fractionated equivalent may be the Paresis phonolite.},

abstract = {An unusually iron-rich, strongly peralkaline dyke occurring near the Ilimaussaq intrusion, south Greenland, is described. The dyke has developed two facies characterised respectively by the mafic assemblages pyroxene+amphibole+aemigmatite, and pyroxene+magnetite. The differences can be explained as an effect of loss of up to 4{\%} Na1O from the magnetite-bearing facies (relative to the magnetite-free facies). The effect is in accordance with the phase relations at 1 atm in the synthetic system Na2OAl2O2Fe2O2SiO2. Continued alkali loss and magnetic precipitation will change the differentiation trend from agpaitic with iron enrichment towards miaskitic with iron depletion. It is suggested that the extreme degree of iron enrichment in the dyke resulted from the coincidence of low oxygen fugacity and strong peralkalinity tending to stabilise both ferrous and ferric iron in the liquid.},

abstract = {Tourmaline is widespread in metapelites and pegmatites from the Neoproterozoic Damara Belt, which form the basement and potential source rocks of the Cretaceous Erongo granite. This study traces the B-isotope variations in tourmalines from the basement, from the Erongo granite and from its hydrothermal stage. Tourmalines from the basement are alkali-deficient schorl-dravites, with B-isotope ratios typical for continental crust ($\delta$11B average −8.4‰ ± 1.4, n = 11; one sample at −13‰, n = 2). Virtually all tourmaline in the Erongo granite occurs in distinctive tourmaline-quartz orbicules. This “main-stage” tourmaline is alkali-deficient schorl (20–30{\%} X-site vacancy, Fe/(Fe + Mg) 0.8–1), with uniform B-isotope compositions ($\delta$11B −8.7‰ ± 1.5, n = 49) that are indistinguishable from the basement average, suggesting that boron was derived from anatexis of the local basement rocks with no significant shift in isotopic composition. Secondary, hydrothermal tourmaline in the granite has a bimodal B-isotope distribution with one peak at about −9‰, like the main-stage tourmaline, and a second at −2‰. We propose that the tourmaline-rich orbicules formed late in the crystallization history from an immiscible Na–B–Fe-rich hydrous melt. The massive precipitation of orbicular tourmaline nearly exhausted the melt in boron and the shift of $\delta$11B to −2‰ in secondary tourmaline can be explained by Rayleigh fractionation after about 90{\%} B-depletion in the residual fluid.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive geochemical data set for the most recent volcanics from the Mariana Islands, which provides new constraints on the timing and nature of fluxes from the subducting slab. The lavas display many features typical of island arc volcanics, with all samples showing large negative niobium anomalies and enrichments in alkaline earth elements and lead (e.g., high Ba/La and Pb/Ce). Importantly, many of these key ratios correlate with a large range in 238U excesses, (238U/230Th) = 0.97–1.56. Geochemical features show island to island variations; lavas from Guguan have the largest 238U-excesses, Pb/Ce and Ba/La ratios, while Agrigan lavas have small 238U excesses, the least radiogenic 143Nd/144Nd, and the largest negative cerium and niobium anomalies. These highly systematic variations enable two discrete slab additions to the subarc mantle to be identified. The geochemical features of the Agrigan lavas are most consistent with a dominant subducted sediment contribution. The added sedimentary component is not identical to bulk subducted sediment and notably shows a marked enrichment of Th relative to Nb. This is most readily explained by melt fractionation of the sediment with residual rutile and transfer of sedimentary material as a melt phase. For most of the highly incompatible elements, the sedimentary contribution dominates the total elemental budgets of the lavas. The characteristics best exemplified by the Guguan lavas are attributed to a slab-derived aqueous fluid phase, and Pb and Sr isotope compositions point toward the subducted, altered oceanic crust as a source of this fluid. Variable addition of the sedimentary component, but near-constant aqueous fluid flux along arc strike, can create the compositional trends observed in the Mariana lavas. High field strength element ratios (Ta/Nb and Zr/Nb) of the sediment poor Guguan lavas are higher than those of most mid-oceanic ridge basalts and suggest a highly depleted subarc mantle prior to any slab additions. The 238U-230Th systematics indicate {\textgreater}350 kyr between sediment and mantle melting but {\textless}30 kyr between slab dehydration and eruption of the lavas. This necessitates rapid magma migration rates and suggests that the aqueous fluid itself may trigger major mantle melting.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios determined by laser fluorination analysis on olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase separated from 31 Oligocene flood basalts and rhyolites from Yemen display small but significant variations (5{\textperiodcentered}1–6{\textperiodcentered}2‰ for olivine; 5{\textperiodcentered}5–6{\textperiodcentered}9‰ for clinopyroxene; 5{\textperiodcentered}9–6{\textperiodcentered}9‰ for plagioclase). The range in $\delta$18O values exceeds: (1) the analytical reproducibility of the technique (±0{\textperiodcentered}15‰; 2 SD); (2) the range expected for minerals that would have crystallized from uncontaminated oceanic basalts or primary magmas in equilibrium with mantle peridotite; (3) the range in melt values and equilibrium phenocryst compositions that could be produced by fractional crystallization of these magmas. Samples with the highest $\delta$18O values exhibit increases in 87Sr/86Sr ratio, decreases in 143Nd/144Nd ratio, and increasing Pb isotopic heterogeneity. Samples with the lowest $\delta$18O values have radiogenic isotope ratios that approach those inferred for the Afar plume. The oxygen isotope data provide unequivocal evidence that assimilation of heterogeneous lower and upper Pan-African crust was the primary control on isotopic variation in this continental flood basalt province. Moreover, new radiogenic and oxygen isotope data for Pan-African crustal samples from Yemen have appropriate crustal isotopic compositions to generate the observed isotopic variations in the volcanic rocks. A near-primary high-MgO basalt with low $\epsilon$Nd and extreme Pb isotope ratios contains strongly zoned clinopyroxene crystals that range from green cores through to greenish brown, brownish green and dark brown or black rims. Handpicked crystals of each colour type display the following correlated range in isotope ratios: 87Sr/86Sr = 0{\textperiodcentered}7036–0{\textperiodcentered}7049; 143Nd/144Nd = 0{\textperiodcentered}5129–0{\textperiodcentered}5127; 206Pb/204Pb = 18{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}9; $\delta$18O = 5{\textperiodcentered}67–6{\textperiodcentered}86‰. The Sr–Nd–Pb–O isotope variations are attributed to rapid assimilation of ∼25{\%} Pan-African continental crust by hot mafic magma during clinopyroxene crystallization. Contamination in this flood basalt province varied from combined assimilation and fractional crystallization to rapid assimilation of crust by hot mafic magmas with little fractionation. Laser fluorination oxygen isotope analysis of mineral separates allows small differences in $\delta$18O to be correlated with radiogenic isotope data and is a powerful tool for evaluating the relative roles of enriched lithospheric mantle and continental crust in suites of continental flood basalts.},

abstract = {? 2014 Geological Society of America.A wide range of explanations has been proposed for the origin of repetitive layering in mafic-ultramafic and in (per)alkaline intrusions. Here we propose that the interaction of mineral grains that sink and float in the crystallizing magma is an alternative mechanism that can explain many of the features of layered intrusions, without the need to invoke extrinsic factors. Similar to traffic jams on a motorway, small perturbations in crystal density develop that impede further ascent or descent of buoyant or heavy minerals, respectively. These "traffic jams" separate layers of magma from the rest of the magma chamber. The magma in the individual layers further evolves as a largely independent subsystem, with gravitational sorting organizing the mineral distribution within each layer. Layering can develop in the intermediate range between full mineral separation in low-viscosity or slowly cooling magma chambers and homogeneous crystallization in high-viscosity or fastcooling chambers. This self-organization mechanism provides a novel explanation for the formation of rhythmic layering in low-viscosity magmas, for example in the Il?maussaq igneous complex in southwest Greenland.},

Crystallization experiments used a phonolitic obsidian from the fall-out deposit as the starting material; this contains 5 wt {\%} anorthoclase, diopside and magnetite with minor amounts of biotite and ilmenite, set in a glassy matrix that contains microlites of Ca-rich alkali feldspar. Temperature was varied between 850 and 800°C, and pressure between 200 and 50 MPa. The oxygen fugacity (fO2) was varied between NNO + 0{\textperiodcentered}2 (0{\textperiodcentered}2 log units above the Ni–NiO solid buffer) and NNO − 2, and dissolved water contents varied from 7 to 1{\textperiodcentered}5 wt {\%}. Comparison between natural and experimental phase proportions and compositions indicates that the main body of phonolitic magma was stored at 850 ± 15°C, 50 ± 20 MPa, 2{\textperiodcentered}5 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}5 wt {\%} H2O at an fO2 around NNO − 0{\textperiodcentered}5 prior to eruption, equivalent to depths of between 1 and 2 km below the surface. Some clinopyroxene crystals hosting H2O-rich melt inclusions possibly originate from an intermittent supply of phonolitic magma stored at somewhat deeper levels (100 MPa). The Ca- and Fe-rich composition of alkali feldspar phenocryst rims and microlites attests to the intrusion of a more mafic magma into the reservoir just prior to eruption; this is evidenced by the appearance of banded pumices in the later products of the eruptive sequence. The comparison with other phonolitic magmas from Tenerife and elsewhere (e.g. Vesuvius, Laacher See) shows that differences in the eruption dynamics of phonolitic magmas can be correlated with differences in magma storage depths, along with variations in pre-eruptive volatile contents.},

abstract = {There has been considerable controversy concerning the role of chemical weathering in the regulation of the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and thus the strength of the greenhouse effect and global climate. Arguments center on the sensitivity of chemical weathering to climatic factors, especially temperature. Laboratory studies reveal a strong dependence of mineral dissolution on temperature, but the expression of this dependence in the field is often obscured by other environmental factors that co-vary with temperature. In the field, the clearest correlation is between chemical erosion rates and runoff, indicating an important dependence on the intensity of the hydrological cycle. Numerical models and interpretation of the geologic record reveal that chemical weathering has played a substantial role in both maintaining climatic stability over the eons as well as driving climatic swings in response to tectonic and paleogeographic factors.},

Isothermal heating and step-heating analysis reveal 4He loss to occur systematically by volume diffusion at low temperatures. The linear, low-temperature portion of the diffusion data yields an activation energy of 38.5 ± 8.1 kcal/mol and a frequency factor of In ( D0 a2) = 16.4 ± 2.8 sec-1, corresponding to a closure temperature of 105°C ± 30°C (cooling rate 10°C/m.y.). It appears that U-Th-He dating of apatite might represent a useful new thermochronometer with a range similar to that of fission-track dating of apatite.

abstract = {The Siluro-Ordovician Loch Borralan ( c. 430 Ma) and Loch Ailsh Complexes ( c. 439 Ma) comprise a suite of intrusive rocks ranging in composition from clinopyroxenites, through potassic melasyenites to quartz syenites. The rock suite at Loch Borralan also includes nepheline syenite. Geochemical data in the literature indicate that the intrusions are alkaline, with pronounced enrichments in LILE and LREE relative to contemporaneous calc-alkaline magmatic centres further to the south-east, although they share similar high LILE/Nb, subduction-related characteristics. The Loch Borralan Complex is associated with marginal gravity and magnetic anomalies which can be interpreted in terms of a shallow body less than 400 m thick. Analysis of rocks and drill core revealed widespread elevated Pt and Pd values in pyroxenites and syenites in both complexes. The highest concentrations, up to about 900 ppb Pt+Pd, occur in pyroxenites in the Loch Borralan Complex. Extensive archived drill core provides an excellent section through the marginal pyroxenites, which host the PGE at Loch Borralan. The pyroxenites show unusual petrological features; early clinopyroxene is followed by biotite, apatite, magnetite, sphene and plagioclase with later garnet, which might be metasomatic in origin. Sulphides occur in minor amounts. High-temperature shearing produced local granulation and mylonitisation. Later brittle deformation caused extensive micro-fracturing and the introduction of minor carbonate veining. Platinum-group minerals (PGM) were located in a number of samples with high PGE assay values. These occur as clusters of grains around 1 - 2 mum in diameter, and are difficult to identify uniquely. A few grains appear to be magmatic; these are Pt and PtPd sulphides that occur enclosed in clinopyroxene or garnet. All other grains occur in late fractures or along grain boundaries. These include sperrylite (PtAs2), Pd antimonides and PdBi tellurides, along with hessite (Ag2Te). They occur in microfractures accompanied by carbonate and barite and fine-grained sulphides and are probably of secondary origin. The PGE in the pyroxenites may have been introduced during the magmatic phase of the intrusion but the observed distribution of PGM results from low-temperature, hydrothermal remobilisation following brittle deformation and introduction of fluids.},

abstract = {Recent K-Ar dating of eruptions at Pantelleria, a peralkaline volcanic island in the Strait of Sicily, shows a correlation between eruption of pantellerite lavas from caldera ring fractures and low stands of sea level as determined from$\delta$ 18O stratigraphy. Post-caldera pantellerite lavas associated with an ∼ 114-ky-old caldera erupted along the ring-fracture zone during a major low stand of sea level at about 67 Ka. The most recent episode of lava-flow emplacement began about 20 ky ago during the last glacial maximum. Magma vented along the ring fault of a 45-ky-old caldera, from fractures radial to the caldera, and along faults formed by intracaldera trapdoor uplift. Two mechanical models based on elasticity theory are presented to explain the correlation of post-caldera ring-fracture eruptions at Pantelleria with lowering of sea level. A simple analysis of a bending circular plate of thickness,T r, and radius,R, representing the magma-chamber roof block, shows that tensile stress is concentrated by a factor of 0.75R 2/T r 2 at the lower perimeter of the plate when sea level drops. Stress changes may be even greater ifT r is effectively less than the stratigraphic thickness due to layering of rocks in the roof block. Calculated stress changes due to a 100-m drawdown of sea level are similar in magnitude to stresses associated with dike propagation. More realistic model geometries, including different chamber shapes, a conical volcanic edifice, and sea-level drawdown beyond the surface projection of the magma chamber, were tested using the boundary-element method. Lowering sea level generates a horizontal tensile stress above the chamber, even when sea water is removed outboard of the magma chamber. For some chamber geometries the magnitude of the tensile stress maximum is greater than the ∼ 1 MPa pressure of the 100 m of removed water and is of the right order of magnitude for dike propagation. Dikes initiated by the change of the stress field may originate and propagate along fractures inboard of the chamber margin. The magnitudes of tensile maxima along the top of the chamber decrease as original sea level is moved outboard of the chamber margin and as the chamber thickness decreases. When the depth to the top of the magma chamber reaches a critical value, dependent on chamber geometry, the propagation of dikes to the surface is inhibited.},

abstract = {Earth is the “blue planet,” with more than 70{\%} of its surface covered in water and the equivalent of up to four oceans of water in its interior. This abundance of water has a profound impact on the processes that shape our planet as well as the development of the organisms that inhabit it. To understand this impact, it is necessary to know the properties and compositions of this fluid. At present, this information is largely unavailable, because direct samples of fluid are rare, especially for early Earth and Earth's interior, and other estimators are semiquantitative, at best. Here we propose a different approach in which the composition of the fluid is reconstructed from that of minerals, based on the characteristic trace element partitioning between minerals and aqueous fluids. We show experimentally that this partitioning is systematic and obeys lattice-strain theory. It depends strongly on element complexation in the fluid, but this dependence is predictable and can be accommodated. Unlike fluids, minerals with preserved compositions are readily available in the geological record, and this approach therefore provides a powerful and widely applicable tool to reconstruct a quantitative record of fluid composition for the full range of Earth environments and for its earliest history.},

abstract = {A lithospherically weak zone embracing the southern margin of the Greenland Archaean craton and the Ketilidian Julianeh{\aa}b batholith underwent repeated rifting during the interval 1350–1140 Ma, accompanying breakup of Palaeopangaea. The Gardar Province comprises the area affected by the faulting and asssociated alkaline magmatism. While an estimated 2–5 km of Proterozoic cover has been eroded, rift-fill successions have been preserved in early fault-bounded basins.
The orientation of dyke swarms changed from WNW–ESE to nearly NE–SW during Gardar times. The principal swarms are inferred to occupy zones of lithospheric thinning and graben development. Central-type intrusive complexes, largely of syenites and nepheline syenites, reached shallow levels. The principal magmatic evolution was from transitional olivine basalt through to phonolites. Accompanying silica-oversaturated magma generation involved greater degrees of crustal assimilation. Anorthositic xenoliths in the Gardar intrusions imply the presence of an extensive anorthositic complex at depth, regarded as an integral part of the North American Proterozoic massif anorthosite association. The most primitive Gardar basalts are themselves relatively evolved, probably as a result of olivine±pyroxene fractionation during crustal underplating. The Gardar basic rocks are troctolitic with elevated Al2O3/CaO ratios: their incompatible element patterns suggest a significant input from lithospheric sources. The Ca-deficient nature of the Gardar basalts is attributed to an origin involving lithospheric mantle depleted by previous melting events. Trace element and isotopic signatures suggest considerable heterogeneity in the mantle sources which are ascribed to differential metasomatism of clinopyroxene-poor peridotite sources by small-fraction asthenospheric melts. The ultramafic lamprophyre/carbonatite association that recurred throughout the period is inferred to have originated from melting of metasomites deep within the lithospheric mantle. Affinities between the alkaline intrusions over an interval of {\textgreater}100 Ma characterize the Gardar as a coherent magmatic province and support the contention that the magmas are largely of lithospheric origin. The energy required to generate the very large requisite volumes of primitive magmas may have been supplied by successive mantle plumes. The Gardar magmatism pre- and post-dates the ∼1.27 Ga Mackenzie Igneous Events of North America but wholly pre-dates the ∼1.1 Ga Keweenawan magmatism associated with the Midcontinent Rift.},

abstract = {The effect of the anhydrous composition on the solubilities of H2O and CO2in mafic melts varying from MORB to nephelinite was investigated experimentally between 50 and 500MPa at 1200 to 1250°C. In all compositions, CO2is only present as carbonate species in the quenched glasses. The concentrations of dissolved H2O and CO2have been analyzed by KFT (Karl-Fischer titration) and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). The Mid-Infrared (MIR) absorption coefficients for the H2O band at 3500cm-1are identical within error for all investigated melt compositions and equal to 59.2±4L/(mol*cm). The absorption coefficients for the carbonate bands vary in the range 306±32 to 360±24L/(mol*cm) for the 1430cm-1band and in the range 349±25 to 394±27L/(mol*cm) for the 1520cm-1band. However, a simple correlation with the melt composition could not be determined.Water solubility in mafic to intermediate melts increases slightly with the total alkali content and the effect of composition is more pronounced at higher pressures. At 500MPa, the solubility of H2O in melts coexisting with nearly pure H2O fluids varies from 8.8 to 9.5wt.{\%} H2O. A strong effect of melt composition on the solubility of CO2is observed at all investigated pressures. For instance, at 500MPa, mafic melts coexisting with nearly pure CO2fluids can dissolve from around 0.32 to more than 1.30wt.{\%} CO2as melt composition changes from tholeiite to nephelinite. The compositional effect on the solubility of CO2in melts coexisting with pure CO2fluid is best described by non-linear (exponential) correlations with compositional parameters such as the parameter $\Pi$ proposed by Dixon (1997; American Mineralogist, 82: 368-378) or structural parameters (e.g., nonbridging oxygen per tetrahedrally coordinated cation). The obtained relationships are used to propose empirically derived equations of the form ln(CO2)=1.150{\textperiodcentered}lnP+6.71{\textperiodcentered}$\Pi$*-1.345, where CO2is the solubility of CO2in silicate melts in wt.{\%} (at 1200 to 1250°C), P is pressure in MPa and $\Pi$* is a compositional parameter ($\Pi$*=Ca2++0.8K++0.7Na++0.4Mg2++0.4Fe2+)/(Si4++Al3+) with cations expressed as cation fractions in melt.},

abstract = {A series of monazite dissolution experiments was conducted in a hydrous (1-6 wt.{\%}) granitic melt at 8 kbar over the temperature range 1,000-1,400° C. A polished cube of monazite was immersed in a natural obsidian melt and allowed to partially dissolve. Electron microprobe traverses perpendicular to the crystal-melt interface revealed concentration gradients in the LREEs and P. Diffusivities of the LREEs and P were calculated from these profiles, yielding the following Arrhenius relations for the LREEs: D=0.23 exp(-60.1 kcal mol-1/RT) at 6{\%} water D=2.30×107 exp(-122.1 kcal mol-1/RT) at 1{\%} water These results demonstrate the importance of dissolved water on REE diffusion. Phosphorus diffusivities are nearly identical to those of the rare-earths, suggesting that P diffusion charge-compensates REE diffusion. The concentration of LREEs required for monazite saturation in these melts is given by the level of dissolved LREEs at the crystal-melt interface. These values also show a dependence on dissolved water, with LREEsat=60 ppm at 6{\%} H2O when extrapolated down to 700° C, and LREEsat=30 ppm at 1{\%} H2O. Calculated dissolution rates based on the above parameters indicate that minute ({\textless}30 $\mu$m diameter) monazite crystals will be readily digested by an enclosing anatectic magma under reasonable geologic conditions (i.e., T=700-800° C and {\textgreater}2{\%} H2O), whereas larger ({\textgreater} 50 $\mu$m) crystals will likely be residual over the duration of an anatectic event. The low solubility of monazite in this melt suggests that the LREE depletion observed in some felsic differentiation suites may be the result of monazite crystallization. Limited experimental and geochemical/petrologic evidence indicates that compositional changes in the melt accompanying differentiation decrease the solubility of monazite drastically. Kinetic and chemical constraints may also lead to localized monazite saturation and inclusion in major phases or even other accessories. Variations in the REE composition of monazite from different parageneses probably reflects the REE pattern of the parent melt, and may be due to gradational differences in the stability of individual or subgroup REE-complexes as a function of melt composition. Particularly important in this regard seems to be the lime+alkali/alumina balance of the melt and its volatile content. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The partitioning of fifteen trace elements (Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd, Yb, Hf, Ta, Pb, and Th) between clinopyroxene and synthetic melt has been studied in two compositions along an isotherm in the diopside-albite-anorthite ternary at 1 bar pressure. The two compositions correspond to {\~{}}Di65An35 and {\~{}}Di55Ab45 and produce clinopyroxenes distinct in chemistry while melt compositions range from 49 wt{\%} SiO2 to 61 wt{\%} SiO2. The partition coefficients of high field strength elements (HFSE) increase by factors of 2-8 in Di-An experiments relative to Di-Ab experiments while other elements show very little change (±20{\%}) between compositions. The change in HFSE partitioning correlates with increases in tetrahedral Al2O3 ((IV)Al) content of clinopyroxenes in the anorthite-bearing experiments. Changes in D(Ta)/D(Nb) also correlate with (IV)Al based on a survey of previously published determinations. Tests of models of trace element substitution energetics produce values for Young's modulus (E) and optimum D (D(o)) consistent with previous results for clinopyroxene for mono-, di-, and trivalent cations. The wide variations in partitioning behavior for tetra- and pentavalent cations are also consistent with these models because the high values for E make partition coefficients and relative HFSE partitioning sensitive to small changes in composition. The overall increase in HFSE partitioning and D(o) for the DiAn composition is consistent with D(o) increasing as a function of (IV)Al, consistent with the role of (IV)Al in charge balancing HFSE. However, (IV)Al must also cause lattice changes that affect the ability of the clinopyroxene to discriminate between Nb and Ta. There are two important implications to the observed dependence of HFSE partition coefficients on clinopyroxene aluminum content. First, HFSE will be fractionated from their adjacent REE within ultramafic samples during melting of spinel lherzolite as clinopyroxene Al2O3 content decreases. Second, fractionations between Nb and Ta and Zr and Hf observed in mantle-derived magmas are consistent with extraction of melt in equilibrium with spinel lherzolite having clinopyroxenes with {\~{}}5 wt{\%} Al2O3. The fractionations among HFSE (Nb/Ta, Hf/Zr) and between HFSE and REE observed in both arc magmas and upper mantle peridotites may simply reflect prior depletion by major melting events (F {\textgreater} 10{\%}) which left clinopyroxene as a residual phase. We speculate that the peridotitic sources for MORB and arc lavas are similar in composition with both having significant HFSE anomalies. However, MORB do not typically record HFSE anomalies because of the complementary contribution of HFSE from enriched mafic veins interspersed within the peridotite.},

abstract = {Two geochemical proxies are particularly important for the identification and classification of oceanic basalts: the Th–Nb proxy for crustal input and hence for demonstrating an oceanic, non-subduction setting; and the Ti–Yb proxy for melting depth and hence for indicating mantle temperature and thickness of the conductive lithosphere. For the Th–Nb proxy, a Th/Yb–Nb/Yb projection demonstrates that almost all oceanic basalts lie within a diagonal MORB–OIB array with a principal axis of dispersion along the array. However, basalts erupted at continental margins and in subduction zones are commonly displaced above the MORB–OIB array and/or belong to suites with principal dispersion axes which are oblique to the array. Modelling of magma–crust interaction quantifies the sensitivity of the Th–Nb proxy to process and to magma and crustal compositions. For the Ti–Yb proxy, the equivalent Ti/Yb–Nb/Yb projection features a discriminant boundary between low Ti/Yb MORB and high Ti/Yb OIB that runs almost parallel to the Nb/Yb axis, reflecting the fact that OIB originate by melting beneath thicker lithosphere and hence by less melting and with residual garnet. In the case of volcanic-rifted margins and oceanic plume–ridge interactions (PRI), where hot mantle flows toward progressively thinner lithosphere (often becoming more depleted in the process), basalts follow diagonal trends from the OIB to the MORB field. Modelling of mantle melting quantifies the sensitivity of the Ti–Nb proxy to mantle potential temperature and lithospheric thickness and hence defines the petrogenetic basis by which magmas plot in the OIB or MORB fields. Oceanic plateau basalts lie mostly in the centre of the MORB part of that field, reflecting a high degree of melting of fertile mantle. Application of the proxies to some examples of MORB ophiolites helps them to be further classified as C (contaminated)-MORB, N (normal)-MORB, E (enriched)-MORB and P (plume)-MORB ophiolites, which may add a useful dimension to ophiolite classification. In the Archean, the hotter magmas, higher crustal geotherms and higher Th contents of contaminants all result in widespread crustal input that is easy to detect geochemically with the Th–Nb proxy. Application of this proxy to Archean greenstones demonstrates that almost all exhibit a crustal component even when reputedly oceanic. This indicates, either that some interpretations need to be re-examined or that intra-oceanic crustal input is important in the Archean making the proxy less effective in distinguishing oceanic from continental settings. The Ti–Yb proxy is not effective for fingerprinting Archean settings because higher mantle potential temperatures mean that lithospheric thickness is no longer the critical variable in determining the presence or absence of residual garnet.},

abstract = {The partition coefficients KD=cfluid/cmelt of Cu, Sn, Mo, W, U, and Th between aqueous fluid and melt were measured in the systems haplogranite-H2O−HCl and haplogranite-H2O−HF at 2kbars, 750°C, and Ni−NiO buffer conditions using rapid-quench cold seal bombs, with many reversed runs. Concentrations of trace elements (1–1000 ppm) in the quenched aqueous fluid and in the glass were determined by plasma emission spectrometry (DCP). KD of F is close to 1 in the system studied. KD of Cu and Sn strongly increases with increasing Cl concentration due to the formation of chloride complexes in the aqueous fluid, while HF has no effect. However, in 2M HCl, KD of Cu approaches 100, while KD of Sn is below 0.1 under the same conditions. The partition coefficients of Mo and W are high if water is the only volatile present (Mo: 5.5, W: 3.5), but strongly decrease with increasing HCl and HF, due to the destabilization of hydroxy complexes. KD of U and Th is very low in the absence of complexing agents, but strongly increases with increasing HF concentration. KD of U also increases with increasing HCl concentration and with increasing CO2 concentration in the system haplogranite-H2O−CO2, indicating the stability of chloride and carbonate complexes of U at magmatic temperatures. The data suggest a stoichiometric ratio of Cl: U=3:1 and of F:U=2:1 in these complexes. Cl-rich fluids are responsible for the formation of porphyry Cu deposits, but are much less effective in the transport of Sn. F appears not to be essential for the concentration of Mo and W in fluids evolving from a granitic magma. The different complexing behavior of U and Th in aqueous fluids may account for their fractionation during magma genesis.},

abstract = {Lower crustal xenoliths recovered from Eocene to Cambrian kimberlites in the central and southern Slave craton are dominated by mafic granulites (garnet, clinopyroxene, plagioclase±orthopyroxene), with subordinate metatonalite and peraluminous felsic granulites. Geothermobarometry indicates metamorphic conditions of 650–800 °C at pressures of 0.9–1.1 GPa. The metamorphic conditions are consistent with temperatures expected for the lower crust of high-temperature low-pressure (HT-LP) metamorphic belts characteristic of Neoarchean metamorphism in the Slave craton. U–Pb geochronology of zircon, rutile and titanite demonstrate a complex history in the lower crust. Mesoarchean protoliths occur beneath the central Slave supporting models of an east-dipping boundary between Mesoarchean crust in the western and Neoarchean crust in the eastern Slave. At least, two episodes of igneous and metamorphic zircon growth occurred in the interval 2.64–2.58 Ga that correlate with the age of plutonism and metamorphism in the upper crust, indicating magmatic addition to the lower crust and metamorphic reworking during this period. In addition, discrete periods of younger zircon growth at ca. 2.56–2.55 and 2.51 Ga occurred 20–70 my after the cessation of ca. 2.60–2.58 Ga regional HT-LP metamorphism and granitic magmatism in the upper crust. This pattern of younger metamorphic events in the deep crust is characteristic of the Slave as well as other Archean cratons (e.g., Superior). The high temperature of the lower crust immediately following amalgamation of the craton, coupled with evidence for continued metamorphic zircon growth for {\textgreater}70 my after ‘stabilization' of the upper crust, is difficult to reconcile with a thick (200 km), cool lithospheric mantle root beneath the craton prior to this event. We suggest that thick tectosphere developed synchronously or after these events, most likely by imbrication of mantle beneath the craton at or after ca. 2.6 Ga. The minimum age for establishing a cratonic like geotherm is given by lower crustal rutile ages of ca. 1.8 Ga in the southern Slave. Transient heating and possible magmatic additions to the lower crust continued through the Proterozoic, with possible additional growth of the tectosphere.},

abstract = {Kimberlites from Southern Africa, along with their low-Cr megacrysts, have unusual Hf–Nd isotopic characteristics. Group I and Transitional kimberlites define arrays trending oblique to, and well below, the Nd–Hf isotope ‘mantle array', defined by oceanic basalts, i.e. they have negative $\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf values. Group I kimberlites have $\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf values varying from −1.2 to −10.1. Low-Cr megacryst suites from individual Group I kimberlites have compositions that overlap those of their host kimberlites. The trend for all Group I kimberlite megacrysts ($\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf values −1.0 to −9.0) shows a striking correspondence to that of the Group I kimberlite field. Group II kimberlites and their low-Cr megacrysts plot on or close to the mantle Nd–Hf array ($\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf values 3.6 to −2.6). The data indicate a genetic link between kimberlites and the low-Cr megacryst suite. The negative $\Delta$$\epsilon$Hf characteristics of Group I kimberlites and their megacrysts require a source component that is ancient ({\textgreater}1 Ga), and has evolved with low time-integrated Lu/Hf relative to Sm/Nd. Our preferred option is that this component originates beneath the lithosphere, from a reservoir of ancient, deeply subducted oceanic basalt that became incorporated into the convecting mantle source region for Group I and Transitional kimberlites.},

Concentrations of Rb range from about 1000 to 3600 ppm but other trace elements could not be measured reliably by electron microprobe. The resulting trends of melt evolution are similar to those described by the whole-rock samples, despite petrographic evidence for albite- and mica-rich egregations previously taken as evidence for post-magmatic metasomatism. Melt variation trends in most samples are consistent with fractional crystallization as the main process of magma evolution and residual melt compositions plot at the granite minimum in the normative Qz-Ab-Or system. However, melts trapped in the highly evolved pegmatitic samples from Orlovka deviate from the minimum melt composition and show compositional variations in Al, Na and K that requires a different explanation. We suggest that unmixing of the late-stage residual melt into an aluminosilicate melt and a salt-rich dense aqueous fluid (hydrosaline melt) occurred. Experimental data show the effectiveness of this process to separate K (aluminosilicate melt) from Na (hydrosaline melt) and high mobility of the latter due to its low viscosity and relatively low density may explain local zones of albitization in the upper parts of the granite. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The origins of cumulate rocks are re-examined in the light of new concepts in the fluid dynamics of crystallising systems. We propose that during the formation of adcumulate rocks, compositional convection allows continuous exchange of melt in the pores of a cumulus pile with the main magma reservoir. We consider this explanation to be physically more plausible than that proposed in the conventional cumulus theory. We present an experimental study of crystallisation in a porous medium to illustrate the process, and a theoretical analysis to demonstrate its applicability to magma chambers. We also consider factors which may inhibit convection and thus lead to the formation of meso- and orthocumulates. Finally we suggest how these ideas may be used to understand the distribution of these different rock types in layered intrusions. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {Extensive flows of the Columbia River Basalt (CRB) Group in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are dominantly inflated compound pahoehoe sheet lavas. Early studies recognized that CRB lavas are compound pahoehoe flows, with textures suggesting low flow velocities, but it was thought that the great thickness and extent of the major flows required very rapid emplacement as turbulent floods of lava over a period of days or weeks. However, small volume ({\textless} 1 km³) compound pahoehoe flows on Kilauea, Hawai'i, demonstrate that such flows can thicken by at least an order of magnitude through gradual inflation and the same mechanism has been proposed for larger (10–20 km3) pahoehoe flows in Iceland. The vertical distribution of vesicles and other morphologic features within CRB lava flows indicate that they grew similarly by inflation. Small pahoehoe lobes at the base and top of many CRB pahoehoe lava flows indicate emplacement in a gradual, piecemeal manner rather than as a single flood. We propose that each thick CRB sheet flow was active for months to years and that each group of flows produced by a single eruption (a flow field) was emplaced slowly over many years.},

abstract = {Lead isotopic compositions of young volcanic rocks from different tectonic environments have distinctive characteristics. Their differences are evaluated within the framework of global tectonics and mantle differentiation. Ocean island leads are in general more radiogenic than mid-ocean ridge basalt (m.o.r.b.) leads. They form linear trends on lead isotopic ratio plots. Many of the trends extend toward the field of m.o.r.b. On plots of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}207{\}}{\$}Pb/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb against {\$}{\^{}}{\{}206{\}}{\$}Pb/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb, their slopes are generally close to 0.1. Island arc leads in general are confined between sediment and m.o.r.b. type leads with slopes of ca. 0.30 on a plot of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}207{\}}{\$}Pb/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb against {\$}{\^{}}{\{}206{\}}{\$}Pb/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb. Pb, Sr and Nd isotopic data of Hawaiian volcanics are closely examined. Data from each island support a two-component mixing model. However, there is a lack of full range correlation between islands, indicating heterogeneity in the end members. This mixing model could also be extended to explain data from the Iceland-Reykjanes ridge, and from 45 degrees N on the Atlantic Ridge. The observed chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in young volcanic rocks is considered to be a result of long-term as well as short-term mantle differentiation and mixing. Lead isotopic data from ocean islands are interpreted in terms of mantle evolution models that involve long-term (more than 2 Ga) mantle chemical and isotopic heterogeneity. Incompatible element enriched 'plume' -type m.o.r.b. have Th/U ratios ca. 3.0 too low and Rb/Sr ratios ca. 0.04 too high to generate the observed {\$}{\^{}}{\{}208{\}}{\$}Pb and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Sr respectively for long periods of time. Elemental fractionation in the mantle must have occurred very recently. This conclusion also applies to mantle sources for ocean island alkali basalts and nephelinites. Depletion of incompatible elements in m.o.r.b. sources is most probably due to continuous extraction of silicate melt and/or fluid phase from the low-velocity zone throughout geological time. Data on Pb isotopes, Sr isotopes and trace elements on volcanic rocks from island arcs are evaluated in terms of mixing models involving three components derived from (1) sub-arc mantle wedge, (2) dehydration or partial melting of subducted ocean crust, and (3) continental crust contamination. In contrast to the relation between {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Sr/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}86{\}}{\$}Sr and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}143{\}}{\$}Nd/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}144{\}}{\$}Nd ratios of ocean volcanics, there is a general lack of correlation between Pb and Sr isotopic ratios except that samples with very radiogenic Pb ({\$}{\^{}}{\{}206{\}}{\$}Pb/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb {\$}\backslashgeq {\$} 19.5) have low {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Sr/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Sr ratios (0.7028-0.7035). These samples also have inferred source Th/U ratios (3.0-3.5) not high enough to support long-term growth of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}208{\}}{\$}Pb. Data suggest that their mantle sources have long-term integrated depletion in Rb, Th, U and light r.e.e. High {\$}{\^{}}{\{}238{\}}{\$}U/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}204{\}}{\$}Pb ({\$}\backslashmu {\$}) values required by the Pb isotopic data are most probably due to depletion of Pb by separation of a sulphide phase. Relations between Pb, Sr and Nd isotopic ratios of young volcanic rocks could be explained by simultaneous upward migration of silicate and/or fluid phase and downward migration of a sulphide phase in a differentiating mantle.},

abstract = {Radiogenic isotopes are widely used to investigate crustal evolutionary processes, however recent claims of Nd and Sr isotope disequilibrium during anatexis question the reliability of such information. We have conducted an in situ Sm–Nd isotope study of apatite, allanite, titanite, xenotime and monazite in metasedimentary rocks of different metamorphic grade to test Nd isotope equilibrium during metamorphism. Our results show that apatite retains an original, probably detrital, highly variable Nd isotopic signature until at least 500 °C before being isotopically homogenised, irrespective of textural context within the rock. Once equilibrated, apatite retains its Nd isotope signature throughout anatexis. In contrast, allanite and titanite are equilibrated at temperatures as low as 350–400 °C. REE-rich accessory minerals in high-grade rocks (∼600°C) show very similar initial $\epsilon$Nd values at the time of metamorphism. We conclude that under these metamorphic conditions Nd isotope disequilibrium between crustal melts and metasedimentary sources is unlikely. Intra-grain Nd isotope zoning of monazite indicates that partial melting was open system, involving the injection of externally-derived melt into migmatites. This process, likely to be common in anatectic terranes but not always obvious at hand-specimen scale or from bulk rock geochemical data, can produce isotope variation that could potentially be misinterpreted as disequilibrium between the melt and its protolith.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. It is well established that A-type granites enriched in high field strength elements, such as Zr, Nb and the REE, form in anorogenic tectonic settings. The sources of these elements and the processes controlling their unusual enrichment, however, are still debated. They are addressed here using neodymium and oxygen isotope analyses of samples from the 1.24 Ga Strange Lake pluton in the Paleoproterozoic Core Zone of Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador, an A-type granitic body characterized by hyper-enrichment in the REE, Zr, and Nb. Age-corrected $\epsilon$Nd values for bulk rock samples and sodic amphiboles (mainly arfvedsonite) from the pluton range from −0.6 to −5.7, and −0.3 to −5.3, respectively. The $\epsilon$Nd values for the Napeu Kainiut quartz monzonite, which hosts the pluton, range from −4.8 to −8.1. The  147 Sm/ 144 Nd ratios of the suite and the host quartz monzonite range from 0.0967 to 0.1659, large variations that can be explained by in situ fractionation of early LREE-minerals (Strange Lake), and late hydrothermal HREE remobilization. Oxygen isotope analyses of quartz of both Strange Lake and the host yielded $\delta$ 18 O values between +8.2 and +9.1, which are considerably higher than the mantle value of 5.7 ± 0.2‰. Bulk rock oxygen isotope analyses of biotite-gneisses in the vicinity of the Strange Lake pluton yielded $\delta$ 18 O values of 6.3, 8.6 and 9.6‰. The negative $\epsilon$Nd values and positive $\delta$ 18 O values of the Strange Lake and Napeu Kainiut samples indicate that both magmas experienced considerable crustal contamination. The extent of this contamination was estimated, assuming that the contaminants were sedimentary-derived rocks from the underlying Archean Mistinibi (para-) gneiss complex, which is characterized by low $\epsilon$Nd and high $\delta$ 18 O values. Mixing of 5–15{\%} of a gneiss, having an $\epsilon$Nd value of −15 and a $\delta$ 18 O value of +11, with a moderately enriched mantle source ($\epsilon$Nd = +0.9, $\delta$ 18 O = +6.3) would produce values similar to those obtained for the Strange Lake granites. Based on analogies between the Nain Plutonic Suite and the Gardar alkaline igneous province (SW-Greenland), we conclude that the Strange Lake pluton and associated REE-mineralized anorogenic bodies formed from a combination of subduction-induced fertilization of the sublithospheric mantle, crustal extension and in situ magma evolution.},

abstract = {We have investigated trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and silicic melts ranging from 62 to 69 wt{\%} SiO2 in piston-cylinder experiments at 1.1 GPa and 1145-1155 degrees C. Run products consist of diopsidic clinopyroxene (with 3-5 wt{\%} Al2O3 and similar to 1 wt{\%} Na2O) coexisting with silicic, aluminous, and alkaline melts. Clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients for rare earth elemendts (REE) are significantly higher (e.g., D-Sm = 0.76 to 3.1) than previous studies of clinopyroxene-basaltic melt partitioning. The maximum D-REE is also shifted toward middle REE (e.g., Tb). Although the partition coefficients of Sr and Ti (D-Sr = 0.23-0.39, D-Ti = 0.28-1.0) are also elevated relative to clinopyroxene-basaltic melt, partition coefficients for Zr and Li (0.14-0.23 and 0.16-0.25, respectively) are within the range of literature values. The high partition coefficients for REE, Sr, and Ti in this study do not reflect crystal-compositional effects. For instance, no relationship is observed between Al-1V and these partition coefficients. REE and Ti partition coefficients correlate poorly with jadeite component of the clinopyroxene; however, the elevated Na2O contents of both the melt and clinopyroxene make it difficult to discriminate fully the effect of jadeite component from the effect of changes in melt structure. The non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation ratio (NBO/T; Mysen et al. 1985) varies from 0.08 to 0.17 and roughly correlates with D-epx/melt(REE), consistent with a recent study (Gaetani 2004) that concluded that melt structure significantly affects partitioning when NBO/T {\textless} 0.49. Notably, we find a strong correlation between the molar Ca2+/(M+ + M2+) of the melt and the optimum D (D-0) for the REE, indicating that melt structure, and not jadeite content, is the dominant control on clinopyroxene-melt partitioning in these experiments. The partition coefficients for the REE, Ti, Zr, and Sr are in good agreement with observed clinopyroxene-silicic glass partitioning within mantle xenoliths (Chazot et al. 1996; Vannucci et al. 1998), indicating these results may apply to lithospheric melting. Furthermore, the origin of hump-shaped REE patterns observed in residual clinopyroxene from abyssal peridotites could be explained if shallow depleted melts of peridotite are silica-rich. A two-stage fractional melting model assuming clinopyroxene-silicic melt partitioning at shallow mantle depths from 10 to 30 km beneath a mid-ocean ridge can reproduce the observed hump-shaped REE patterns. If so, hump-shaped REE patterns may provide evidence for the existence and extraction of silica-rich melt created in the shallow mantle.},

Fragmentation scenarios involving possible combinations of the three fragmentation mechanisms are evaluated for two models of magma (with isolated and with connected pores). Experimental results for magma fragmentation under high decompression rates appear to support such mechanisms.

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica, is an active, intraplate, alkaline volcano. The strongly undersaturated sodic lavas range from basanite to anorthoclase phonolite, and are termed the Erebus lineage (EL). The lavas are porphyritic with olivine (Fo88–51), clinopyroxene (Wo45–53En36–41Fs8–30), opaque oxides (Usp31–76), feldspar (An72–11), and apatite. Rare earth element (REE) contents increase only slightly with increasing differentiation compared with other incompatible elements. The light REE are enriched (LaN/YbN= 14–20) and there are no significant Eu anomalies. 87Sr/86Sr is uniform and low (˜ 0.7030) throughout the EL, suggesting derivation of the basanites from a depleted asthenospheric mantle source, and lack of significant crustal contamination during fractionation of the basanite. Regular geochemical trends indicate that the EL evolved from the basanites by fractional crystallization. Major element mass balance calculations and trace element models show that fractionation of 16{\%} olivine, 52{\%} clinopyroxene, 14{\%} Fe-Ti oxides, 11{\%} feldspar, 3{\%} nepheline, and 3{\%} apatite from a basanite parent leaves 23.5{\%} anorthoclase phonolite. Minor volumes of less undersaturated, more iron-rich benmoreite, phonolite, and trachyte are termed the enriched iron series (EFS). The trachytes have 87Sr/86Sr of 0.704, higher than other EFS and EL rocks, and they probably evolved by a combined assimilation-fractional crystallization process. The large volume of phonolite at Mt. Erebus requires significant basanite production. This occurs by low degrees of partial melting in a mantle plume (here termed the Erebus plume) rising at a rate of about 6 cm/yr.},

abstract = {Pantelleria, Italy, is a continental rift volcano consisting of alkalic basalt, trachyte, and pantellerite. At 1 atm along the FMQ buffer, the least-evolved basalt (Mg {\#}= 58.5{\%} norm ne) yields olivine on the liquidus at ∼1,180° C, followed by plagioclase, then by clinopyroxene, and by titanomagnetite and ilmenite at ∼ 1,075°. After ∼70{\%} crystallization, the residual liquid at ∼1,025° is still basaltic and also contains apatite and possibly kaersutite. A less alkalic basalt shows the same order of phase appearance. Glass compositions define an Fe-enrichment trend and a density maximum for anhydrous liquids that coincides with a minimum in Mg{\#}. During the initial stages of crystallization at 1 atm, liquids remain near the critical plane of silica-undersaturation until, at lower temperatures, Fe-Ti oxide precipitation drives the composition toward silica saturation. Thus the qtz-normative trachytes and pantellerites typically associated with mildly ne-normative basalts in continental rifts could be produced by low-pressure fractional crystallization or by shallow-level partial melting of alkali gabbro. At 8 kbar, clinopyroxene is the liquidus phase at ∼1,170° C, followed by both olivine and plagioclase at ∼1,135°. Because clinopyroxene dominates the crystallizing assemblage and plagioclase is more albitic than at 1 atm, liquids at 8 kbar are driven toward increasingly ne-normative compositions, suggesting that higher-pressure fractionation favors production of phonolitic derivatives. Natural basaltic samples at Pantelleria are aphyric or contain 1–10{\%} phenocrysts of plag≥ ol≥cpx or ol{\textgreater}cpx, with groundmass Fe-Ti oxides and apatite. The lack of phenocrystic plagioclase in two of the lavas suggests that crystallization at slightly higher PH2O may have destabilized plagioclase relative to the 1-atm results, but there is no preserved evidence for significant fractionation at mantle depths as clinopyroxene is the least abundant phenocryst phase in all samples and contains only small amounts of octahedral Al. The liquid line and phenocryst compositions match more closely the 1-atm experimental results than those at 8 kbar. Although major-element trends in natural liquids and crytals reflect low-pressure fractionation, minor- and trace-element concentrations preserve evidence of multiple parental liquids. Scatter in variation diagrams exceeds that attributable to crystal accumulation in these phenocryst-poor rocks, and the large range in concentrations of P and Ti at high MgO contents cannot be produced by polybaric fractionation nor by mixing with coexisting felsic magmas. Sr and O isotope ratios rule out significant interaction with crystalline upper crust, Mesozoic shelf sediments, or Tertiary evaporites. Positive correlations of compatible and incompatible elements suggest that the basalts are not simply related to one another by closed-system fractional crystallization of a single parental magma. Increasing Ce/Yb with Ce suggests that these relations are not a product of mixing within a replenished magma chamber, nor of mixing with more felsic members of the suite, which have smaller Ce/Yb ratios. Low-pressure fractional crystallization of ol+cpx+ plag±oxides from slightly different parental magmas produced by varying degrees of melting of garnet-bearing peridotite is a possible scenario. Small and infrequently replenished magma reservoirs in this continental rift environment may account for the strongly differentiated nature of the Pantellerian basalts. There is no correlation between Mg{\#} and eruptive frequency, in part because concentration of volatiles in residual liquids offsets the effect of Fe-enrichment on melt density, such that strong Fe-enrichment is no hindrance to eruption.},

abstract = {We present major and trace element and Sr–Nd–Pb–Hf–Os isotopic data for the 76–58 Ma Western Cape melilitite province, an age-progressive magmatic lineation in which primitive olivine melilitite intrusives and alkali basalt lavas have been emplaced on the southwestern margin of South Africa. The magmas range from alkali basalts with strong HIMU isotopic and trace element affinities on the continental shelf to melilitites with kimberlite-like incompatible element compositions and EM 1 isotopic affinities on thick Proterozoic lithosphere (i.e. 87Sr/86Sri = 0{\textperiodcentered}7029–0{\textperiodcentered}7043, $\epsilon$Nd(t) = +5 to +2, 206Pb/204Pbi = 20{\textperiodcentered}5–18{\textperiodcentered}1). The samples are characterized by radiogenic 187Os/188Osi (0{\textperiodcentered}15–0{\textperiodcentered}21) and unradiogenic Hf isotope ratios, causing some of them to fall outside the compositional range of oceanic basalts. This suggests that they tap a mafic HIMU source component that is less dilute than or compositionally different from that tapped by HIMU ocean island basalts. Os–Pb and Nd–Hf isotopic co-variations suggest that the sources of the Western Cape melilitites were generated by a two-stage mixing process in which (1) mafic material (e.g. ancient oceanic crust) underwent solid-state mixing with a small proportion of asthenospheric peridotite and then (2) high-degree melts of this hybrid material mixed with low-degree melts of metasomatized continental lithospheric mantle. A similar process may help to explain the isotopic variations of Group 1 kimberlites, but the available data do not allow us to rule out a major role for convecting mantle components in kimberlite genesis. Using the Western Cape melilitites as an analog, we propose a model in which the strong HIMU isotopic signature present in most Late Cretaceous to Recent alkaline magmatic provinces across Africa is supplied not by conventional mantle plumes, but rather by pods of recycled oceanic crust brought up from the deep mantle within a long-lived, and laterally broad mantle upwelling feature located beneath the African plate.},

abstract = {The generation of trondhjemites and tonalites on a massive scale during the Archean (3.8-2.5 Ga ago) marked the transition from a simatic to a sialic crust, and represents the magmatic contribution to cratonization. Petrogenetic models for the origin of these rocks based on their highly fractionated, HREE-depleted rare earth patterns suggest a mafic crustal source, either through a process of partial melting of amphibolite, garnet-amphibolite, or eclogite, in which hornblende and/or garnet are essential residual phases, or by hornblende-controlled fractionation of hydrous basaltic magma. A series of vapor-absent (i.e., Pfluid{\textless} Ptotal) melting experiments on four natural basaltic compositions were conducted at 8, 16, 22 and 32 kbar in order to assess the validity of models for the origin of Archean granitoids which assume a mafic crustal source. Melt compositions produced by 10–40{\%} melting are tonalitic-trondhjemitic at all pressures investigated; residual assemblages are amphibole+plag±opx±FeTi at 8 kbar, garnet+cpx±amphibole±plag±opx±FeTi oxide at 16 kbar, and garnet+cpx±rutile at 22 and 32 kbar. REE patterns for most of the trondhjemitic-tonalitic partial melts, calculated on the basis of estimated modal proportions of melt and residual phases, are highly fractionated (LaYb is 30–50), heavy rare earth-depleted (YbN is 1–10) when garnet is present to some extent in the residue; these REE patterns are similar to those of trondhjemitic and tonalitic gneisses from several Archean “grey gneiss” and granite-greenstone terrains. A consideration of estimated Archean geotherms with respect to the experimental P-T conditions indicates that a temporally diminishing Archean geotherm might have progressively swept through a P-T regime in which trondhjemitic-tonalitic melts could have been generated initially from a water-saturated (Pf=Pt) to undersaturated (Pf{\textless}Pt) amphibolite source by partial melting at 5–8 kbar. Subsequent relaxation of the geotherm through the mid- to late-Archean would have produced similar melts by vapor-absent melting of garnet-amphibolite at 16 kbar and eclogite at 22–32 kbar. However, the degree of melting required to produce melts of trondhjemitic-tonalitic composition increases with pressure, 10–15{\%} melting being appropriate at 8 kbar in a amphibole-dominated residue, but 25–35{\%} melting being required at 22–32 kbar, where garnet dominates the residue. Supposing the tendency for melt segregation and/or magma mobilization mechanisms to be more effective at higher degrees of melting, an origin by partial melting of eclogite seems to be the most likely source for massive plutonic trondhjemite-tonalite contributions to the juvenile continents. Such a source is consistent with the generation of trondhjemite-tonalite protocontinental cores in any number of plausible Archean tectono-thermal scenarios, though not necessarily in a conventional subduction-zone setting.},

abstract = {An experimental study of the effect of boron in the water saturated Q-Or-Ab-B2O3-H2O system has been performed at P=1 Kbar to provide experimental data and explain the role of boron in some late magmatic and early hydrothermal events. Experiments were conducted between 500° C and 800° starting from a gel, or a previously crystallized gel, and variable amounts of boron (0 to 18{\%} B2O3) added to water. The phases obtained were: quartz, sanidine, albite, silicate liquid quenched to glass, and aqueous vapour phase. Boric acids, borates and isotropic low index materials were found in the quenched vapour phase. An aluminium silicate-like mineral, not yet fully identified, is also present. The solidus temperature of the Q-Or-Ab composition is lowered by 60° C when 5 wt. {\%} B2O3 is added and by more than 130° C when 17wt. {\%} B2O3 is added. Compositions of equilibrated silicate melts and vapours were obtained between 780° C and 750° C for various B2O3 concentrations. The vapour phase is B and Si rich. It is also enriched in Na with respect to K, and in alkalis with respect to Al. Its silicate solute content is higher than in experiments with pure water. The solubility of water is increased by the addition of boron in Q-Or-Ab melts. Microprobe data show that the melts equilibrated with vapour phases become hyperaluminous and more potassic than sodic. The partition coefficient of boron is in favour of the vapour (k D=B2O3{\%} in melt/B2O3{\%} in vapour=0.33±0.02). The effect of the interaction between the silicate phases and the vapour is discussed. Comparison is made between the behaviour of boron and that of chlorine and fluorine. Geological applications are also provided, which concern the influence of boron on minimum melting, on muscovite stability and on the hypersolvus-subsolvus transition.},

abstract = {The Eocene Tamazeght complex, High Atlas Mountains, Morocco is a multiphase alkaline to peralkaline intrusive complex. A large variety of rock types (including pyroxenites, glimmerites, gabbroic to monzonitic rocks, feldspathoidal syenites, carbonatites and various dyke rocks) documents a progression from ultramafic to felsic magmatism. This study focuses on the silicate plutonic members and the genetic relationships between the various lithologies. Based on detailed petrographic and mineral chemical data we show that the various units crystallized under markedly different oxygen fugacity and silica activity conditions and demonstrate how these parameters influence both the phase assemblage and the detailed chemical evolution of the fractionating phases. Nepheline, olivine-clinopyroxene and hornblende-plagioclase thermometry indicate equilibration temperatures {\textgreater}= 800 degrees C for all major rock types. Highly oxidized conditions (close to the hematite-magnetite buffer) are characteristic of the garnet-rich pyroxenites, ultrapotassic glimmerites and associated olivine-shonkinites. The parental magmas to these rocks evolved from low initial a(SiO2) values of 0.1 to values of 0.5-0.8 during nepheline and alkali feldspar saturation. In contrast, the monzonitic rocks evolved from initially high aSiO2 values (up to 0.75) down to about 0.1 at intermediate values of oxygen fugacity (Delta FMQ=+2-5 to -1, where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer). For nepheline syenites and malignites, more reduced conditions (Delta FMQ=-2) and intermediate a(SiO2) values (between 0.25 and 0.5) dominate. We conclude that fractional crystallization is not a likely mechanism to explain the large variety of lithologies present in the Tamazeght complex. It is more probable that successive melting of a compositionally heterogeneous mantle source region gave rise to several melt batches with distinct chemical and physicochemical characteristics. Low-degree melts from a K-phase-bearing mantle domain resulted in the formation of ultrapotassic glimmerites, whereas garnet-rich pyroxenites and olivine-shonkinites may have originated from hybrid melts and partly from a pyroxene-dominated source. Less alkaline lithologies such as monzonites potentially reflect larger degrees of melting and the increased importance of a basaltic component, whereas nepheline syenites and malignites may be explained by lower degrees of melting and a more alkaline character for the parental melt of these rocks.},

The discovery of giant planets orbiting other stars is a formidable opportunity to learn more about these objects, what is their composition, how various processes influence their structure and evolution, and most importantly how they form. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune can be studied in detail, mostly from close spacecraft flybys. We can infer that they are all enriched in heavy elements compared to the Sun, with the relative global enrichments increasing with distance to the Sun. We can also infer that they possess dense cores of varied masses. The intercomparison of presently caracterised extrasolar giant planets show that they are also mainly made of hydrogen and helium, but that they either have significantly different amounts of heavy elements, or have had different orbital evolutions, or both. Hence, many questions remain and are to be answered for significant progresses on the origins of planets.},

abstract = {Situated in a submerged continental rift, Pantelleria is a volcanic island with a subaerial eruptive history longer than 300 Ka. Its eruptive behavior, edifice morphologies, and complex, multiunit geologic history are representative of strongly peralkaline centers. It is dominated by the 6-km-wide Cinque Denti caldera, which formed ca. 45 Ka ago during eruption of the Green Tuff, a strongly rheomorphic unit zoned from pantellerite to trachyte and consisting of falls, surges, and pyroclastic flows. Soon after collapse, trachyte lava flows from an intracaldera central vent built a broad cone that compensated isostatically for the volume of the caldera and nearly filled it. Progressive chemical evolution of the chamber between 45 and 18 Ka ago is recorded in the increasing peralkalinity of the youngest lava of the intracaldera trachyte cone and the few lavas erupted northwest of the caldera. Beginning about 18 Ka ago, inflation of the chamber opened old ring fractures and new radial fractures, along which recently differentiated pantellerite constructed more than 25 pumice cones and shields. Continued uplift raised the northwest half of the intracaldera trachyte cone 275 m, creating the island's present summit, Montagna Grande, by trapdoor uplift. Pantellerite erupted along the trapdoor faults and their hingeline, forming numerous pumice cones and agglutinate sheets as well as five lava domes. Degassing and drawdown of the upper pantelleritic part of a compositionally and thermally stratified magma chamber during this 18-3-Ka episode led to entrainment of subjacent, crystal-rich, pantelleritic trachyte magma as crenulate inclusions. Progressive mixing between host and inclusions resulted in a secular decrease in the degree of evolution of the 0.82 km3 of magma erupted during the episode. The 45-Ka-old caldera is nested within the La Vecchia caldera, which is thought to have formed around 114 Ka ago. This older caldera was filled by three widespread welded units erupted 106, 94, and 79 Ka ago. Reactivation of the ring fracture ca. 67 Ka ago is indicated by venting of a large pantellerite centero and a chain of small shields along the ring fault. For each of the two nested calderas, the onset of postcaldera ring-fracture volcanism coincides with a low stand of sea level. Rates of chemical regeneration within the chamber are rapid, the 3{\%} crystallization/Ka of the post-Green Tuff period being typical. Highly evolved pantellerites are rare, however, because intervals between major eruptions (averaging 13−6 Ka during the last 190 Ka) are short. Benmoreites and mugearites are entirely lacking. Fe-Ti-rich alkalic basalts have erupted peripherally along NW-trending lineaments parallel to the enclosing rift but not within the nested calderas, suggesting that felsic magma persists beneath them. The most recent basaltic eruption (in 1891) took place 4 km northwest of Pantelleria, manifesting the long-term northwestward migration of the volcanic focus. These strongly differentiated basalts reflect low-pressure fractional crystallization of partial melts of garnet peridotite that coalesce in small magma reservoirs replenished only infrequently in this continental rift environment.},

abstract = {The McDermitt volcanic field covers an area of 20,000 km2 in southeastern Oregon and northwestern Nevada and consists of seven large-volume ash flow sheets that vented from 16.1 to 15 Ma ago. The volcanic field is characterized by peralkaline, high-silica rhyolite, and all but one of the sheets are comendites. The ash flow field overlies a 1.5-km-thick section of Miocene Steens volcanic series and Steens Basalt, indicating a minimum age of 16.1 Ma for the Steens Basalt. The Orevada rift, a 200-km-long NNW-striking structure, developed just prior to eruption of the mafic lavas. Each ash flow sheet resulted in the formation of a large collapse caldera along the Orevada rift. The center of the volcanic field is dominated by four overlapping and nested calderas; satellitic to these are three additional calderas. The areas adjacent to the incipient calderas subsided during ash flow eruption. Thickening of the ash flow sheets, monoclinal warping outside the caldera ring fault, and tilting in toward the caldera of blocks bounded by curvilinear faults all indicate regional subsidence prior to caldera collapse. The McDermitt caldera complex is highly mineralized; it contains ore deposits of Hg, Sb, Cs, Li, and U. The peralkaline tuffs have high contents of these elements and were the source rocks from which metals were leached by hydrothermal systems developed during the last stage of caldera-related volcanism.},

abstract = {We use thallium (Tl) concentrations, K/Rb, K/Tl and Rb/Tl ratios and Tl isotopes in minerals from the alkaline to peralkaline Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex (South Greenland) to trace magmatic differentiation, crustal assimilation, magmatic degassing, ore precipitation and hydrothermal metasomatism. Closed-system magmatic differentiation is marked by a coherent decrease of K/Tl- and K/Rb-ratios, whereas crustal assimilation results in a strong Tl-enrichment, causing low K/Tl-ratios compared to K/Rb-ratios. Thallium isotopes show only slight changes during orthomagmatic differentiation and the assimilation of crustal material cannot be traced, since the isotopic composition of the average crust is within the range of the mantle and mantle-derived rocks. Magmatic degassing, however, increases Rb/Tl-ratios and changes the isotopic composition of Tl. The released fluids are enriched in Tl, characterized by high 205Tl/203Tl ratios and can precipitate Tl-rich sulfide and silicate minerals as indicated by some late-magmatic hydrothermal veins, which contain a conspicuous assemblage of Tl-Fe-Cu-sulfides (thalcusite, djerfisherite, chalcothallite). The oxidative alteration of these assemblages at high pH results in small-scale redistribution of Tl. Thallium released by this process is entrained into late-stage Tl-enriched astrophyllite.},

abstract = {At the Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry Cu-Au deposit, NW Argentina, several key textural elements preserve evidence for volatile separation. Interconnected miarolitic cavities, while being studied extensively in granites, have now been recognized in intrusions related to porphyry Cu mineralization. Pods of saccharoidal quartz are connected by narrow, anastomosing zones of graphic quartz-alkali feldspar intergrowths and ragged biotite (with lesser apatite and magnetite). Their connectivity can be as much as 15 cm; however, more commonly, the interconnected miarolitic cavities are approximately 1 to 2 rum across and 5 cm or less, long. Features such comb-quartz layered textures and magmatic-hydrothermal veins (P veins), combined with aqueous fluid phase equilibria from fluid inclusions, better constrain physical models of exsolution. We interpret these textures in the context of vapour phase formation, coalescence and accumulation in an evolving silicic magma. Recognition of textures, such as the interconnected miarolitic cavities reported here, may provide a simple exploration tool for porphyry Cu deposits, helping explorers to recognize evidence for a potentially fertile intrusions.

abstract = {The south-eastern part of Kunene Intrusive Complex (KIC), Namibia/Angola, is host to volumetrically significant, and economically important, concentrations of sodalite in the area around Swartbooisdrif, north-west Namibia. The mineralisation was formed by metasomatic exchange with carbonatites of the Epembe-Swartbooisdrif Alkaline Province. This process led to the breakdown of ore minerals initially present in various rock types of the KIC and caused the formation of new opaque phases in the sodalite-bearing metasomatites. A detailed investigation of textures and chemical compositions of the Fe-Ti oxides and sulphides has allowed evaluation of the complex ore-forming processes related to the polyphase magmatic and metasomatic history of the sodalite deposit. The predominant opaque phases in the various rock types of the KIC are ilmenite and (titano)magnetite, which are highly concentrated in the so- called magnetite plugs. It is clear from the textural evidence that most of the ilmenite and (titano)magnetite, although of orthomagmatic origin, recrystallised under subsolidus conditions. Conformably, their respective chemical compositions and phase relations represented in the system FeO-1/2Fe(2)O(3)- TiO2 point to reequilibration at temperatures below 600 degrees C. Ilmenite and (titano)magnetite were affected by later deformation and decomposed by various reactions, related to, or outlasting, the metasomatic process. Oxidation of ilmenite led to the formation of symplectitic aggregates of rutile and secondary magnetite. Carbonatisation of the Fe-Ti oxides produced rutile and the siderite and rhodochrosite components in ankerite. Pyrite, in part together with rutile and secondary magnetite, was formed by sulphidation of the Fe-Ti oxides. Conspicuous aggregates of granular or lamellar intergrowths of pyrite with hematite and/or magnetite are interpreted as products of contemporaneous sulphidation and oxidation of former igneous pyrrhotite. Rarely observed pyrrhotite with pentlandite lamellae is probably not an igneous relic, but was formed during the metasomatic event. Smaller amounts of chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite-chalcocite, galena, ferroan siegenite, millerite and polydymite testify to different cooling stages during or after metasomatism. Applying the phase relations in the simplified system Fe-Co-Ni-S-O, we were able to reconstruct a semi-quantitative T-f(S-2)-f(O-2) path for the ore-forming processes.},

abstract = {The Ninetyeast Ridge is an ∼5500 km long, north–south-oriented, submarine volcanic ridge in the eastern Indian Ocean that formed from magmatism associated with the deep-seated Kerguelen mantle plume as the Indian plate drifted rapidly northward during the Late Cretaceous. Basalts recovered along the ridge have the characteristic Dupal geochemical signature of Indian Ocean basalts, but debate concerning the nature and number of components in their mantle source persists. New multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Pb, Hf) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (Sr, Nd) isotopic analyses were obtained for tholeiites representative of the ∼180 m of basaltic basement recovered from three drill sites (Site 758, 82 Ma; Site 757, 58 Ma; Site 756, 43 Ma) along the Ninetyeast Ridge during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 121. No systematic isotopic variation is observed along the ridge, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis of an aging mantle plume origin for the ridge. The isotopic compositions are generally intermediate between those of the volcanic products of the Kerguelen and Amsterdam–St. Paul hotspots and define mixing trends between components with relatively enriched and depleted signatures. At least three, possibly four, source components are required to explain the observed isotopic variability along the Ninetyeast Ridge. The unradiogenic signatures of some Ninetyeast Ridge basalts (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr = 0{\textperiodcentered}70381–0{\textperiodcentered}70438) are not related to the source of Indian MORB and indicate the presence of a relatively depleted component in a deep mantle source. A similar source component is also identified in other Indian Ocean island basalts (e.g. Crozet, R{\'{e}}union) not related to magmatic activity of the Kerguelen hotspot. The Pb–Hf–Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the Ninetyeast Ridge basalts are consistent with the presence of a mixture of recycled sediments and lower continental crust together with altered oceanic crust in their mantle source, hence supporting a deep origin for the enriched Dupal signature encountered in ocean island basalts.},

abstract = {We report the first find of chromitite in the mantle harzburgite of the Advocate ophiolite complex, Baie Verte Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada. Chromitite occurs as centimetric veins, pods and schlieren enveloped by dunite at Middle Arm Brook. The composition of the chromian spinel is homogeneous, with relatively high Cr{\#} and low TiO2, and is consistent with formation of the chromitite by interaction of boninite-type basaltic melt with residual mantle in a supra-subduction arc setting. Chromitites contain up to 1028 ppb total PGE, with significant enrichment in PPGE relative to IPGE, and are characterized by a positive slope of the chondrite-normalized patterns. This is uncommon in typical ophiolitic chromitites, and distinguishes the Middle Arm Brook chromitites from those in the mantle harzburgite of other Appalachian ophiolites (Bay of Island and Thetford Mines), which usually display negative PGE patterns with low Pd/Ir values. The PGM assemblage consists of sulfides (laurite and an undefined Ir–S phase), native PGE (osmium, ruthenium), PPGE – base-metal alloys and PPGE antimonides. The textural characteristics of the IPGE sulfides suggests that they are magmatic in origin. In contrast, the PPGE minerals invariably occur associated with low-temperature alteration phases (ferrian chromite, Fe oxides, serpentine, chlorite, brucite, awaruite, heazlewoodite, and Co-rich pentlandite). The PPGE alloys are interpreted to represent the product of desulfurization of a primary sulfide precursor, which had segregated at a high temperature interstitially to the chromite. This fact is unusual for sulfide-undersaturated boninites, and indicates that sulfide saturation was reached during the late stage of chromite precipitation, possibly by assimilation of sulfur from the country-rock mantle peridotite.},

abstract = {The crystallization of a hydrous basaltic-andesite magma was investigated using cooling and decompression experiments. These experiments were designed so that the driving force for crystallization of feldspar (the undercooling) is equal whether in the direction of cooling or decompression. After initial equilibration steps at conditions T=1025{\textordmasculine}C and PH2O=150MPa, charges were either cooled or decompressed near-instantaneously to final conditions corresponding to undercoolings DELTA T*=52-154{\textordmasculine}C, with dwell times of 12, 24 and 48h at the final P-T. This 'single-step' experimental strategy (SSD for decompression experiments, SSC for cooling) allowed derivation of kinetic parameters such as nucleation and growth rates as a function of undercooling. Even though our setup was primarily designed to investigate feldspar crystallization, we report kinetic and geochemical data for all phases present (glass, feldspar, clinopyroxene, olivine and amphibole). At low to intermediate undercoolings, the solidification behavior of mafic-intermediate magmas is very similar texturally and compositionally whether the crystallization mechanism is cooling or decompression. At high degrees of undercooling, feldspar and clinopyroxene nucleation rates are nevertheless higher in SSD compared to SSC runs, perhaps due to slower diffusivities or larger nucleation barriers in the cooling runs. Minerals transition from interface-limited growth to diffusion-limited growth with increasing undercooling, while nucleation regimes shift from homogeneous to heterogeneous. Crystal morphologies are highly variable but can be used qualitatively to assess the extent of undercooling. Relative to more silicic melts with similar crystal contents, feldspar formed in andesitic melts nucleate at a lower rate but grow to larger sizes. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Although carbon dioxide is one of the major components of crustal fluids responsible for ore deposit formation, its effect on transport and precipitation of metals remains unknown, due to a lack of direct experimental data and physical–chemical models for CO2-rich fluids. To fill this gap, we combined laboratory experiments and thermodynamic modeling to systematically quantify the role played by CO2for the solubility of economically important metals such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Au, Mo, Pt, Sn under hydrothermal conditions. Solubility measurements of common ore minerals of these metals (FeS2, CuFeS2, ZnS, Au, MoS2, PtS, SnO2) were performed, using a flexible-cell reactor equipped with a rapid sampling device, in a single-phase fluid (CO2–H2O–KCl) at 350–450 °C and 600–750 bar, buffered with iron sulfide and oxide and alkali-aluminosilicate mineral assemblages. In addition, another type of experiments was conducted to measure gold solubility in more sulfur-rich supercritical CO2–H2O–S–NaOH fluids at 450 °C and 700 bar using a batch reactor that allows fluid quenching. Our results show that the solubilities of Si, Au, Mo, Pt and Cu either decrease (within {\textless}1 log unit) or remain constant upon CO2increase, whereas those of Fe, Zn and Sn increase significantly ({\textgreater}1 log unit) with CO2contents in the fluid increasing from 0 to 50 wt{\%}. These data were interpreted using a simple model that does not require any new adjustable parameters, and is based on the dielectric constant of the H2O–CO2solvent and on the Born solvation parameter for the dominant metal-bearing species in an aqueous fluid. Our predictions using this model suggest that in a supercritical CO2–H2O–S-salt fluid typical of metamorphic Au deposits, in equilibrium with pyrite and chalcopyrite, the Cu/Fe ratio decreases by up to 2 orders of magnitude with an increase of CO2content from 0 to 70 wt{\%}. This effect is due to the decrease of the fluid dielectric constant in the presence of CO2, which favors the stability of neutral species (FeCl20) compared to charged ones (CuCl2−). Our results explain the Fe enrichment and Cu depletion in metamorphic gold deposits formed by CO2-rich fluids. The transport of gold is unfavorable in the presence of CO2only in S-rich ({\textgreater}0.5 wt{\%} S) fluids in which Au forms the negatively charged Au(HS)2−and Au(HS)S3−complexes. By contrast, it is only weakly affected in S-poor ({\textless}0.1 wt{\%} S) acidic-to-neutral fluids in which the uncharged Au(HS)0complex predominates. Thus, even at very high CO2contents ({\textgreater}50 wt{\%} CO2), the capacity of such fluids to transport gold (up to 100s ppb Au) remains comparable to that of aqueous fluids. These findings are in agreement with analyses of natural fluid inclusions in metamorphic deposits. In more saline oxidizing and S-rich fluids such as those in magmatic porphyry Cu–Au deposits, the Fe, Cu, and Au solubilities in the presence of CO2decrease by ∼1 order of magnitude with CO2increasing to 20–30 wt{\%}, following the decrease in the stability of their dominant charged species (FeCl42−, CuCl2−, Au(HS)2−and Au(HS)S3−), but stay almost constant at higher CO2contents (30–70 wt{\%}) as controlled by the neutral species (FeCl20, Cu(HS)0and Au(HS)0). Such solubility trends suggest a new potential trigger of ore precipitation in porphyry systems by CO2pulses from the magmatic chamber, which may operate along with commonly admitted depositional mechanisms such as cooling, vapor-brine immiscibility, and water–rock interaction. The direct effect of CO2on the mobility of Pt and Mo, metals that likely form hydrogen sulfide and oxy-hydroxide complexes, respectively, is expected to be weak in most settings. Among the studied elements, Sn is the only one whose solubility may be favored at high CO2content ({\textgreater}20 wt{\%}) due to carbonate complexing. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that, contrary to common belief, the presence of CO2in a supercritical fluid may lead to enhanced mobility or, on contrary, to massive precipitation of some metals, depending on salinity and sulfur content, and, more generally, to significant fractionations between different metals.},

abstract = {The distribution of rare earth elements (REE) between clinopyroxene (cpx) and basaltic melt is important in deciphering the processes of mantle melting. REE and Y partition coefficients from a given cpx-melt partitioning experiment can be quantitatively described by the lattice strain model. We analyzed published REE and Y parti- tioning data between cpx and basaltic melts using the nonlinear regression method and parameterized key parti- tioning parameters in the lattice strain model (D0, r0 and E) as functions of pressure, temperature, and compositions of cpx and melt. D0 is found to positively correlate with Al in tetrahedral site (AlT) and Mg in the M2 site (MgM2)of cpx and negatively correlate with temperature and water content in the melt. r0 is negatively correlated with Al in M1 site (AlM1) and MgM2 in cpx. And E is positively correlated with r0. During adiabatic melting of spinel lherzolite, temperature, AlT, and MgM2 in cpx all decrease systematically as a function of pressure or degree of melting. The competing effects between temperature and cpx composition result in very small variations in REE partition coefficients along a mantle adiabat. A higher potential temperature (1,400?C) gives rise to REE partition coefficients slightly lower than those at a lower potential temperature (1,300?C) because the temperature effect overwhelms the compositional effect. A set of constant REE partition coefficients therefore may be used to accu- rately model REE fractionation during partial melting of spinel lherzolite along a mantle adiabat. As cpx has low Al and Mg abundances at high temperature during melting in the garnet stability field, REE are more incompatible in cpx. Heavy REE depletion in the melt may imply deep melting of a hydrous garnet lherzolite. Water-dependent cpx partition coefficients need to be considered for mod- eling low-degree hydrous melting.},

abstract = {Within the 1.16 Ga old Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusion, up to 700 m large autoliths occur in one stratigraphic unit of the layered floor series of agpaitic nepheline syenites (kakortokites). These autoliths consist of two different rock types: augite syenite and naujaite (agpaitic nepheline syenite). All three rock types show a number of alteration features related to the entrapment of the autoliths in the kakortokite magma caused by the interaction with a fluid phase. In the kakortokites, the oxidation of primary arfvedsonite to aegirine and fluorite is restricted to the close proximity to the autoliths. Close to the surrounding kakortokite, the primary mafic phases of the augite syenites (augite, fayalite, Fe-Ti oxides) are completely replaced by arfvedsonite, aenigmatite, biotite, aegirine and fluorite. The decomposition of primary hastingsite to spectacular aegirine-augite-nepheline-aenigmatite symplectites can be observed up to several meters inside the autoliths. Additionally, fluorite formed at grain boundaries of primary nepheline. In the naujaite autoliths, primary arfvedsonite is replaced by aegirine-biotite intergrowths and abundant aenigmatite is occasionally replaced by Ti-rich aegirine and Fe-Ti oxides. The mineral reactions in the autoliths are used to decipher details of the late to post-magmatic processes in a peralkaline syenitic intrusion. Mineral equilibria record an evolution governed by falling temperature (620 to ca. 500 °C) and increasing relative oxygen fugacity from FMQ + 1 to above FMQ + 4. Quantification of the observed mineral reactions reveals the infiltration of the autoliths with an oxidizing fluid phase rich in Na and F and minor addition of K. Volatiles (H and F) and in some cases also Fe, Ti and Ca (± Mg) released from primary autolith phases were mainly just relocated within the autoliths. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Otjisazu Carbonatite Complex intruded crustal rocks of the Damara Orogen in central Namibia close to the okahandja Lineament. The igneous complex consists of a suite of mela-syenites, syenites and alkali feldspar syenites, and a carbonatite suite comprising clinopyroxenites with calcite and calcite-garnet lenses, feldspathic clinopyroxenites and s{\"{o}}vites with wollastonite-rich lenses. The two suites are considered independent magmatic sequences. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the syenite suite represents a coherent fractionation sequence which evolved by predominantly clinopyroxene, and subordinate fluorapatite and magnetite fractionation at 5-6 kbar. The min-crustal crystallisation level is supported by the supposed cumulative character of most lithologies of the carbonatite suite. Clinopyroxenites and calcite±garnet lenses of the carbonatite suite are considered largely cumulative rocks and represent the lower portion of a carbonatite magma chamber that crystallised clinopyroxene, calcite, andraditic garnet, titanite and fluorapatite. U-Pb dating of titanites suggests an intrusion age of 837+60/-49 Ma, and a metamorphic overprint at 558±5 Ma. These age constraints indicate a rift-related stting of the Otjisazu Carbonatite Complex within the Damaran Orogen. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An electron microprobe was used to measure partition coefficients (D-values) for Ti, Sr, La, Sm, Ho and Lu in amphiboles, clinopyroxenes and Sr- and REE-enriched basanitic melts. D-values were found to be negatively correlated with pressure at pressures from 0.5 to 3.0 GPa. This effect is greatest for Ti and smallest for Lu. Changes in D-values accompanying changes in temperature are less apparent than those caused by changes in pressure. Only DLu for clinopyroxene shows a small but consistent increase as temperature increases from 1050° to 1200°C. D-values for amphibole are not noticeably affected by changes in fO2. In contrast, D-values for clinopyroxene become larger as fO2 increases. The correlations between D-values and pressure may be related to changes in site volumes and electrostatic potentials accompanying shifts in the relative concentrations of AlIV, AlVI and Na+.},

abstract = {Carbonatite lavas are highly unusual in that they contain almost no SiO(2) and are {\textgreater}50 per cent carbonate minerals. Although carbonatite magmatism has occurred throughout Earth's history, Oldoinyo Lengai, in Tanzania, is the only currently active volcano producing these exotic rocks. Here we show that volcanic gases captured during an eruptive episode at Oldoinyo Lengai are indistinguishable from those emitted along mid-ocean ridges, despite the fact that Oldoinyo Lengai carbonatites occur in a setting far removed from oceanic spreading centres. In contrast to lithophile trace elements, which are highly fractionated by the immiscible phase separation that produces these carbonatites, volatiles (CO(2), He, N(2) and Ar) are little affected by this process. Our results demonstrate that a globally homogenous reservoir exists in the upper mantle and supplies volatiles to both mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts. This argues against an unusually C-rich mantle being responsible for the genesis of Na-rich carbonatite and its nephelinite source magma at Oldoinyo Lengai. Rather, these carbonatites are formed in the shallow crust by immiscibility from silicate magmas (nephelinite), and are stable under eruption conditions as a result of their high Na contents.},

abstract = {Major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-O-C isotopic compositions are presented for carbonatites from the Cape Verde (Brava, Fogo, S{\&}aacute;o Tiago, Maio and S{\&}aacute;o Vicente) and Canary (Fuerteventura) Islands. Carbonatites show pronounced enrichment in Ba, Th, REE, Sr and Pb in comparison to most silicate volcanic rocks and relative depletion in Ti, Zr, Hf, K and Rb. Calcio (calcitic)-carbonatites have primary (mantle-like) stable isotopic compositions and radiogenic isotopic compositions similar to HIMU-type ocean island basalts. Cape Verde carbonatites, however, have more radiogenic Pb isotope ratios (e.g. 206 Pb/ 204 Pb=19.3-20.4) than reported for silicate volcanic rocks from these islands (18.7-19.9; Gerlach et al. 1988; Kokfelt 1998). We interpret calcio-carbonatites to be derived from the melting of recycled carbonated oceanic crust (eclogite) with a recycling age of {\~{}}1.6 Ga. Because of the degree of recrystallization, replacement of calcite by secondary dolomite and elevated {\&}{\#}145 13 C and {\&}{\#}145 18 O, the major and trace element compositions of the magnesio (dolomitic)-carbonatites are likely to reflect secondary processes. Compared with Cape Verde calcio-carbonatites, the less radiogenic Nd and Pb isotopic ratios and the negative {\&}{\#}40 7/4 of the magnesio-carbonatites (also observed in silicate volcanic rocks from the Canary and Cape Verde Islands) cannot be explained through secondary processes or through the assimilation of Cape Verde crust. These isotopic characteristics require the involvement of a mantle component that has thus far only been found in the Smoky Butte lamproites from Montana, which are believed to be derived from subcontinental lithospheric sources. Continental carbonatites show much greater variation in radiogenic isotopic composition than oceanic carbonatites, requiring a HIMU-like component similar to that observed in the oceanic carbonatites and enriched components. We interpret the enriched components to be Phanerozoic through Proterozoic marine carbonate (e.g. limestone) recycled through shallow, subcontinental-lithospheric-mantle and deep, lower-mantle sources.},

abstract = {Linear chains of volcanic ocean islands are one of the most distinctive features on our planet. The longest, the Hawaiian–Emperor Chain, has been active for more than 80 million years, and is thought to have formed as the Pacific Plate moved across the Hawaiian mantle plume, the hottest and most productive of Earth's plumes. Volcanoes fed by the plume today form two adjacent trends, including Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, that exhibit strikingly different geochemical characteristics. An extensive data set of isotopic analyses shows that lavas with these distinct characteristics have erupted in parallel along the Kea and Loa trends for at least 5 million years. Seismological data suggest that the Hawaiian mantle plume, when projected into the deep mantle, overlies the boundary between typical Pacific lower mantle and a sharply defined layer of apparently different material. This layer exhibits low seismic shear velocities and occurs on the Loa side of the plume. We conclude that the geochemical differences between the Kea and Loa trends reflect preferential sampling of these two distinct sources of deep mantle material. Similar indications of preferential sampling at the limit of a large anomalous low-velocity zone are found in Kerguelen and Tristan da Cunha basalts in the Indian and Atlantic oceans, respectively. We infer that the anomalous low-velocity zones at the core–mantle boundary are storing geochemical anomalies that are enriched in recycled material and sampled by strong mantle plumes.

Compositions of coexisting biotite and garnet were used to investigate the nonideal solution behavior associated with mixing of Mg, Fe2+, Al, and Ti in the octahedral layer in biotite. Results show that contents of [6]Al and [4]Al in biotite are partially decoupled and that solution of [6]Al can be effectively modeled by means of dioctahedral exchange components of the form Al2 Mg-3 (Mg dioctahedral) and Al2Fe-3 (Fe dioctahedral). Equilibria involving dioctahedral exchange components in biotite allow thermobarometric estimates to be made in metapelitic rocks that are independent of plagioclase and of the grossular content of garnet. The biotite mixing model is applied in this way to generate internally consistent P-T estimates. -from Authors},

abstract = {Mantle xenoliths hosted by the historic Volcan de San Antonio, La Palma, Canary Islands include veined spinel harzburgites and spinel dunites. Glasses and associated minerals in the vein system of veined xenoliths show a gradual transition in composition from broad veins to narrow veinlets. Broad veins contain alkali basaltic glass with semi-linear trace element patterns enriched in strongly incompatible elements. As the veins become narrower, the SiO2-contents in glass increase (46 → 67 wt{\%} SiO2 in harzburgite, 43 → 58 wt{\%} in dunite) and the trace element patterns change gradually to concave patterns depleted in moderately incompatible elements (e.g. HREE, Zr, Ti) relative to highly incompatible ones. The highest SiO2-contents (ca. 68{\%} SiO2, low Ti-Fe-Mg-Ca-contents) and most extreme concave trace element patterns are exhibited by glass in unveined peridotite xenoliths. Clinopyroxenes shift from LREE-enriched augites in basaltic glass, to REE-depleted Cr-diopside in highly silicic glass. Estimates indicate that the most silicic glasses represent melts in, or near, equilibrium with their host peridotites. The observed trace element changes are compatible with formation of the silicic melts by processes involving infiltration of basaltic melts into mantle peridotite followed by reactions and crystallization. The Fe-Mg interdiffusion profiles in olivine porphyroclasts adjacent to the veins indicate a minimum period of diffusion of 600 years, implying that the reaction processes have taken place in situ in the upper mantle. The CaO-TiO2-La/Nd relationships of mantle rocks may be used to discriminate between metasomatism caused by carbonatitic and silicic melts. Unveined mantle xenoliths from La Palma and Hierro (Canary Islands) show a wide range in La/Nd ratios with relatively constant, low-CaO contents which is compatible with metasomatism of “normal” abyssal peridotite by silicic melts. Peridotite xenoliths from Tenerife show somewhat higher CaO and TiO2 contents than those from the other islands and may have been affected by basaltic or carbonatitic melts. The observed trace element signatures of ultramafic xenoliths from La Palma and other Canary Islands may be accounted for by addition of small amounts (1–7{\%}) of highly silicic melt to unmetasomatized peridotite. Also ultramafic xenoliths from other localities, e.g. eastern Australia, show CaO-TiO2-La/Nd relationships compatible with metasomatism by silicic melts. These results suggest that silicic melts may represent important metasomatic agents.},

abstract = {Seismic reflection data from the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) show a series of synclines along the linear eastern boundary faults from north of Karlsruhe to the Jura Mountains. Similar structures do not characterize the northern segment of the graben. The synclinal shape is portrayed by inversion related to transpression on the linear boundary faults, coupled with the conserved easterly dip of the sediments farther inside the tilted hanging block. The onset of transpression preceded the known early Burdigalian unconformity but was also an early Miocene event. It suggests that the regional compression axis (sigma(1)) in early Miocene had a trend between 315 degrees and 0 degrees. The continuous transtension in the northern segment suggests that at no time during the history of the URG was the regional sigma(1) horizontal with a NE-SW trend. The lack of transpressional structures in the younger Plio-Pleistocene sediments along the entire eastern boundary of the URG suggests a late change in the regional stress field. The main eastern boundary faults and synclines north and south of Baden-Baden are all continuous and have the same trend. Kinematically, they form a single graben segment and respond to the regional stress in the same way.},

abstract = {We have performed an experimental study of the influence of varying size and charge on cation partitioning between wollastonite and silicate-carbonate melt in the system CaCO3-SiO2. The experimental conditions (3 GPa, 1420°C) lie close to the wollastonite II tc/I tc phase boundary. Results for 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ partitioning show parabolic dependence of partition coefficients on ionic radius, which can be fitted to the elastic strain model of Blundy and Wood (1994), wherein partitioning is described using three parameters: site radius (r0), site elasticity (apparent Young's Modulus) and the 'strain-free' partition coefficient (D0) for an element with radius r0. The apparent Young's Modulus of the Ca site in wollastonite, obtained from modelling the 2+ partitioning data, is 99 ± 3 GPa, similar to the bulk-crystal value for the polymorph wollastonite I tc. r0 decreases with increasing charge on the substituent cation, while D0 also shows an approximately parabolic dependence on charge, with a maximum for 2+ cations. Partition coefficients for divalent cations Zn, Co, Fe, Cd, Mn and Pb are lower than would be predicted from their ionic radii alone, indicating a preference for the melt. This may be a consequence either of cation-carbonate complexation in the melt, or of the more distorted nature of cation co-ordination environments in melts.},

Several alkaline intrusions and associated dyke swarms were emplaced in Archaean and Ketilidian basement rocks during two main magmatic periods at 1300{\`{A}}1250 Ma and 1180{\`{A}}1140 Ma. The present investigation focuses on mafic dykes from the early magmatic period ('Older Gardar') and the identification of their possible mantle sources. The rocks are typically fine-to coarse-grained dolerites, transitional between tholeiitic and alkaline compositions with a general predominance of Na over K. They crystallized from relatively evolved, mantle-derived melts and commonly show minor degrees of crustal contamination. Selective enrichment of the large ion lithophile elements Cs, Ba and K and the light rare-earth elements when compared to high field-strength elements indicate significant involvement of a sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) component in the generation of the magmas. This component was affected by fluid-dominated supra-subduction zone metasomatism, possibly related to the Ketilidian orogeny {\~{}}500 Ma years prior to the onset of Gardar magmatism. Melt generation in the SCLM is further documented by the inferential presence of amphibole in the source region, negative calculated e Nd(i) values ({\`{A}}0.47 to {\`{A}}4.40) and slightly elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (i) (0.702987 to 0.706472) ratios when compared to bulk silicate earth as well as relatively flat heavy rare-earth element (HREE) patterns ((Gd/Yb) N = 1.4{\`{A}}1.9) indicating melt generation above the garnet stability field. The dyke rocks investigated show strong geochemical and geochronological similarities to pene-contemporaneous mafic dyke swarms in North America and Central Scandinavia and a petrogenetic link is hypothesized. Considering recent plate reconstructions, it is further suggested that magmatism was formed behind a long-lived orogenic belt in response to back-arc basin formation in the time interval between 1290{\`{A}}1235 Ma.},

abstract = {Mantle source regions feeding hotspot volcanoes likely contain recycled subducted material. Anomalous sulphur (S) isotope signatures in hotspot lavas have tied ancient surface S to this deep geological cycle, but their potential modification by shallow magmatic processes has generally been overlooked. Here we present S isotope measurements in magmatic sulphides, silicate melt inclusions and matrix glasses from the recent eruption of a hotspot volcano at El Hierro, Canary Islands, which show that degassing induces strongly negative $\delta$34S fractionation in both silicate and sulphide melts. Our results reflect the complex interplay among redox conditions, S speciation and degassing. The isotopic fractionation is mass dependent ($\Delta$33S = 0‰), thus lacking evidence for the recycled Archaean crust signal recently identified at other hotspot volcanoes. However, the source has an enriched signature ($\delta$34S {\~{}} + 3‰), which supports the presence of younger 34S-rich recycled oceanic material in the Canary Island mantle plume.},

abstract = {XANES analyses at the sulfur K-edge were used to determine the oxidation state of S species in natural and synthetic basaltic glasses and to constrain the fO2 conditions for the transition from sulfide (S2-) to sulfate (S6+) in silicate melts. XANES spectra of basaltic samples from the Galapagos spreading center, the Juan de Fuca ridge and the Lau Basin showed a dominant broad peak at 2476.8eV, similar to the spectra obtained from synthetic sulfide-saturated basalts and pyrrhotite. An additional sharp peak at 2469.8eV, similar to that of crystalline sulfides, was present in synthetic glasses quenched from hydrous melts but absent in anhydrous glasses and may indicate differences in sulfide species with hydration or presence of minute sulfide inclusions exsolved during quenching. The XANES spectra of a basalt from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, and absarokitic basalts from the Cascades Range, Oregon, USA, showed a sharp peak at 2482.8eV, characteristic of synthetic sulfate-saturated basaltic glasses and crystalline sulfate-bearing minerals such as hauyne. Basaltic samples from the Lamont Seamount, the early submarine phase of Kilauea volcano and the Loihi Seamount showed unequivocal evidence of the coexistence of S2- and S6+ species, emphasizing the relevance of S6+ to these systems. XANES spectra of basaltic glasses synthesized in internally-heated pressure vessels and equilibrated at fO2 ranging from FMQ-1.4 to FMQ+2.7 showed systematic changes in the features related to S2- and S6+ with changes in fO2. No significant features related to sulfite (S4+) species were observed. These results were used to construct a function that allows estimates of S6+/$\Sigma$S from XANES data. Comparison of S6+/$\Sigma$S data obtained by S K$\alpha$ shifts measured with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), S6+/$\Sigma$S obtained from XANES spectra, and theoretical considerations show that data obtained from EPMA measurements underestimate S6+/$\Sigma$S in samples that are sulfate-dominated (most likely because of photo-reduction effects during analysis) whereas S6+/$\Sigma$S from XANES provide a close match to the expected theoretical values. The XANES-derived relationship for S6+/$\Sigma$S as a function of fO2 indicates that the transition from S2- to S6- with increasing fO2 occurs over a narrower interval than what is predicted by the EPMA-derived relationship. The implications for natural systems is that small variation of fO2 above FMQ+1 will have a large effect on S behavior in basaltic systems, in particular regarding the amount of S that can be transported by basaltic melts before sulfide saturation can occur. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The compositional dependence of the redox ratio (FeO/FeO1.5) has been experimentally determined in K2O-Al2O3-SiO2-Fe2O3-FeO (KASFF) and K2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-Fe2O3-FeO (KCASFF) silicate melts. Compositions were equilibrated at 1,450° C in air, with 78 mol {\%} SiO2. KASFF melts have from 1 to 5 mol {\%} Fe2O3 and include both peraluminous (K2O{\textless}Al2O3) and peralkaline (K2O{\textgreater}Al2O3) compositions. KCASFF melts have 1 mol {\%} Fe2O3 encompassing peraluminous, metaluminous (CaO+K2O{\textgreater}Al2O3) and peralkaline compositions. Peralkaline KASFF melts with 1 mol {\%} Fe2O3 have low and constant values for the redox ratio, whereas in peraluminous melts the redox ratio increases with increasing (K2O/Al2O3). Increasing total iron concentration increases the redox ratio in peraluminous melts and slightly decreases the redox ratio in peralkaline melts. Substituting CaO for K2O at fixed total iron (1 mol {\%}) increases the redox ratio in both peraluminous and metaluminous KCASFF melts; however, the redox ratio in peralkaline KCASFF melts is not affected by this exchange. These data indicate that Fe3+ is in four-fold coordination, with K+ or Ca2+ providing local charge balance. The tetrahedral ferric species is most stable in peralkaline melts and least stable in peraluminous melts, due to the competition between Al3+ and Fe3+ for charge balancing cations in the latter melt. Tetrahedral Fe3+ is also less stable when Ca2+ provides local charge balance. The data are consistent with a network modifying role for Fe2+ in the melt. The data are interpreted to reflect the effects of melt composition on the partitioning of K+ and Ca2+ and Fe3+ and Al3+ between various species in the melt. These relationships are discussed in terms of homogeneous equilibria between various iron-bearing and iron-free melt species. The results also reflect the effect of liquid composition on the exchange potentials $\mu$Fe3+ Al−1 and $\mu$Ca0.5K−1. The exchange potentials are relatively constant in peralkaline melts, but decrease in metaluminous and peraluminous melts as both (CaO+K2O)/(CaO+K2O+Al2O3) and K2O/CaO decrease. These qualitative observations imply that minerals exhibiting these exchanges will also be similarly affected as liquid composition changes.},

abstract = {Advances in analytical geochemistry have made it possible to determine precisely the concentration of many trace elements and their isotopes in rocks. These data provide the cornerstone for geochemical models of the Earth and terrestrial planets. However, our understanding of how trace elements behave has not kept pace with the analytical advances. As a result, geochemists are often hampered in their interpretation of geochemical data by an incomplete knowledge of trace element partitioning under the conditions of interest. Through advances in trace element microbeam analysis it is now possible to determine partition coefficients experimentally under important conditions, such as during melting of the crust and mantle. This large body of experimental data can be used to investigate the fundamental controls on element partitioning. Simple continuum theories of elastic strain and point charges in crystal lattices, that account, respectively, for mismatch in ionic radius and ionic charge between the substituent trace ion and the lattice site on which it is accommodated, provide a very useful theoretical framework. This approach can be used as the basis for quantitative models of trace element partitioning, in terms of pressure, temperature, redox state and composition, and as a means of predicting partition coefficients for elements not routinely analysed. Experimental studies of partitioning are supported by atomistic computer simulations at zero K. Developments in computational techniques that enable direct simulation of high temperature and pressure mineral-melt partitioning will revolutionise the field in the near future. Use of novel, spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural environment of trace elements in crystals and glasses will provide valuable new data for computational and theoretical models. Extension of high temperature partitioning theory to ambient conditions is an essential step in understanding current climate change proxies, and tackling a host of environmental problems.},

abstract = {Major, trace and volatile elements were measured in a suite of primitive macrocrysts and melt inclusions from the thickest layer of the 10 ka Gr{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}msv{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}tn tephra series (i.e. Saksunarvatn ash) at Lake Hv{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}t{\{}{\'{a}}{\}}rvatn in central Iceland. In the absence of primitive tholeiitic eruptions (MgO {\textgreater} 7 wt{\{}{\%}{\}}) within the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) of Iceland, these crystal and inclusion compositions provide an important insight into magmatic processes in this volcanically productive region. Matrix glass compositions show strong similarities with glass compositions from the AD 1783--1784 Laki eruption, confirming the affinity of the tephra series with the Gr{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}msv{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}tn volcanic system. Macrocrysts can be divided into a primitive assemblage of zoned macrocryst cores (An78--An92, Mg{\{}{\#}{\}}cpx = 82--87, Fo79.5--Fo87) and an evolved assemblage consisting of unzoned macrocrysts and the rims of zoned macrocrysts (An60--An68, Mg{\{}{\#}{\}}cpx = 71--78, Fo70--Fo76). Although the evolved assemblage is close to being in equilibrium with the matrix glass, trace element disequilibrium between primitive and evolved assemblages indicates that they were derived from different distributions of mantle melt compositions. Juxtaposition of disequilibrium assemblages probably occurred during disaggregation of incompatible trace element-depleted mushes (mean La/Ybmelt = 2.1) into aphyric and incompatible trace element-enriched liquids (La/Ybmelt = 3.6) shortly before the growth of the evolved macrocryst assemblage. Post-entrapment modification of plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions has been minimal and high-Mg{\{}{\#}{\}} inclusions record differentiation and mixing of compositionally variable mantle melts that are amongst the most primitive liquids known from the EVZ. Coupled high-field strength element (HFSE) depletion and incompatible trace element enrichment in a subset of primitive plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions can be accounted for by inclusion formation following plagioclase dissolution driven by interaction with plagioclase-undersaturated melts. Thermobarometric calculations indicate that final crystal--melt equilibration within the evolved assemblage occurred at {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1140 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C and 0.0--1.5 kbar. Considering the large volume of the erupted tephra and textural evidence for rapid crystallisation of the evolved assemblage, 0.0--1.5 kbar is considered unlikely to represent a pressure of long-term magma accumulation and storage. Multiple thermometers indicate that the primitive assemblage crystallised at high temperatures of 1240--1300 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C. Different barometers, however, return markedly different crystallisation depth estimates. Raw clinopyroxene--melt pressures of 5.5--7.5 kbar conflict with apparent melt inclusion entrapment pressures of 1.4 kbar. After applying a correction derived from published experimental data, clinopyroxene--melt equilibria return mid-crustal pressures of 4 {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}} 1.5 kbar, which are consistent with pressures estimated from the major element content of primitive melt inclusions. Long-term storage of primitive magmas in the mid-crust implies that low CO2 concentrations measured in primitive plagioclase-hosted inclusions (262--800 ppm) result from post-entrapment CO2 loss during transport through the shallow crust. In order to reconstruct basaltic plumbing system geometries from petrological data with greater confidence, mineral--melt equilibrium models require refinement at pressures of magma storage in Iceland. Further basalt phase equilibria experiments are thus needed within the crucial 1--7 kbar range.},

abstract = {Carbonatites are known to contain the highest concentrations of rare-earth elements (REE) among all igneous rocks. The REE distribution of carbonatites is commonly believed to be controlled by that of the rock-forming Ca minerals (i.e., calcite, dolomite, and ankerite) and apatite because of their high modal content and tolerance for the substitution of Ca by light REE (LREE). Contrary to this conjecture, calcite from the Miaoya carbonatite (China), analyzed in situ by laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry, is characterized by low REE contents (100–260ppm) and relatively flat chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns [average (La/Yb)CN=1.6]. The carbonatite contains abundant REE-rich minerals, including monazite and fluorapatite, both precipitated earlier than the REE-poor calcite, and REE-fluorocarbonates that postdated the calcite. Hydrothermal REE-bearing fluorite and barite veins are not observed at Miaoya. The textural and analytical evidence indicates that the initially high concentrations of REE and P in the carbonatitic magma facilitated early precipitation of REE-rich phosphates. Subsequent crystallization of REE-poor calcite led to enrichment of the residual liquid in REE, particularly LREE. This implies that REE are generally incompatible with respect to calcite and the calcite/melt partition coefficients for heavy REE (HREE) are significantly greater than those for LREE. Precipitation of REE-fluorocarbonates late in the evolutionary history resulted in depletion of the residual liquid in LREE, as manifested by the development of HREE-enriched late-stage calcite [(La/Yb)CN≈0.7] in syenites associated with the carbonatite. The observed variations of REE distribution between calcite and whole rocks are interpreted to arise from multistage fractional crystallization (phosphates⇒calcite⇒REE-fluorocarbonates) from an initially REE-rich carbonatitic liquid.},

Where sills connect to dikes and magmas moved up-section, roof and wall rocks are characterized by wide and intense contact-metamorphic haloes, consistent with throughflow of magma. The geometric constraints suggest that conduits may have opened episodically and then closed when magma pressure waned. The episodic nature of conduit opening events can explain the pulsed ascent of crystal slurries, and may also play a role in the deposition of Ni-sulfides.},

abstract = {The Upper Basin Member rhyolites are the oldest known post-collapse rhyolites of the third Yellowstone caldera. They were erupted near the caldera's resurgent domes between 516 ± 7 and 473 ± 9 ka and at 257 ± 13 ka. An unusual characteristic is their low $\delta$18O signature. Few data are available on their mineralogy and glass geochemistry, and this study fills an important gap in understanding their petrogenesis. We report new mineralogical observations and plagioclase, whole-rock and glass compositional data. Based on our observations, we describe a new lava flow for which we propose the name East Biscuit Basin flow. This unit is a quartz- and sanidine-free low-silica rhyolite (71–72{\%} SiO2 in the whole-rock) in which the dominant mineral, plagioclase, comprises two populations: (1) small fresh euhedral crystals of An20–48 (average of An31) composition, commonly part of aggregates with pyroxenes and Fe–Ti oxides; (2) large sieve-textured isolated crystals, which are slightly more sodic in composition (An19–34, average of An27). Plagioclase compositions in most other Upper Basin Member rhyolites are similar. The range of compositions for trace elements such as Rb, Th, Y and the rare earth elements is small (e.g. 158–189 ppm Rb, 20–25 ppm Th, 52–63 ppm Y, 60–82 ppm La in the whole-rock), and there is no systematic variation of these elements as a function of SiO2 content or mineralogy. Certain trace element signatures and ratios are specific to each of these rhyolites, allowing us to propose that the Upper Basin Member rhyolites originate from six independent magma batches. The coexistence of the two types of plagioclase and their progressive disappearance in the more evolved rhyolites suggest the following petrogenetic model for each magma batch. A low-$\delta$18O rhyolitic protolith is heated by replenishing magmas, which initiate melting, forming a crystal mush. Replenishment by buoyant silicic magma may enhance melting and cause mixing with the mush material. As a consequence, crystal-poor eruptible magma batches are formed, which contain small, more calcic plagioclase crystals (aggregates) formed during cooling and mixing of the replenishing silicic melt, and larger, lower temperature crystals exhibiting dissolution features inherited from the protolith.},

abstract = {Eudialytes are a group of complex Na-Ca zirconosilicate minerals that generally occur in peralkaline agpaitic syenites. Given that eudialytes are easily altered and commonly contain inclusions of earlier-crystallized minerals, in situ laser ablation is considered as the most suitable method to determine their U-Pb ages, and Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic compositions. Electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS analysis of eudialytes from nepheline syenites from Il{\'{i}}maussaq (Greenland), Khibiny and Lovozero (Russia), Saima (China), Tamazeght (Morocco), Kipawa and Mont Saint Hilaire (Canada), Po{\c{c}}os de Caldas (Brazil) and Langesund Fjord (Norway), indicate that this mineral typically has high contents of U, Pb, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and rare earth elements (REE).Analysis of an in-house standard eudialyte by both solution and laser ablation methods demonstrates that precise and accurate U-Pb ages can be obtained from eudialyte after correction for the common Pb content. The high Sr, Nd and Hf contents in eudialyte, coupled with the generally low Rb/Sr and Lu/Hf ratios, also permit the precise determination of in situ Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic ratios by LA-(MC)-ICP-MS methods. However, some eudialytes with Rb/Sr ratio of {\textgreater}0.02 and Yb/Sr{\textgreater}0.1, and Lu/Hf{\textgreater}0.08 (or Yb/Hf {\textgreater}0.4-0.5) cannot be used for in situ Sr and Hf isotopic measurement. Eudialyte is the only mineral investigated to date for which it is possible to determine simultaneously U-Pb ages and Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic compositions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Global climatic effects brought about by volcanism are most likely to be related to the impact of volcanic gases and their derivative aerosols on the atmosphere, rather than the effects of volcanic ash. Evidence from both historic eruptions and polar ice cores indicates that volcanic sulfur gases are the dominant aerosol-forming component, resulting in production of a sulfuric acid-rich stratospheric aerosol that can have profound effects on the Earth's radiation budget over periods of a few years. Due to highly variable sulfur content of different magma types, the climatic effects do not relate simply to total erupted mass. Data on several recent eruptions indicate a close relationship between volcanic sulfur yield to the atmosphere and hemisphere surface temperature decrease following the eruptions, with up to 1° C surface temperature decrease indicated following a major volcanic event such as the 1815 Tambora eruption. While the erupted mass of HCl and HF is equal to or greater than that of sulfur gases in a number of volcanic events, the halogens do not form known aerosols nor are they abundant in ice core acidity layers. Current opinion favors the early removal of halogens from eruption columns by rain flushing and adsorption onto tephra particles, but the fate of halogens in the atmosphere following very large explosive eruptions remains unstudied. CO2 flux to the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions is volumetrically one of the most important of the gas species, but owing to the huge size of the atmospheric reservoir of this gas, the volcanic contribution is likely to have negligible effects, even for event on the scale of the Deccan Traps. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are known for their rapid production of enormous volumes of magma (up to several million cubic kilometres in less than a million years), for marked thinning of the lithosphere, often ending with a continental break-up, and for their links to global environmental catastrophes. Despite the importance of LIPs, controversy surrounds even the basic idea that they form through melting in the heads of thermal mantle plumes. The Permo-Triassic Siberian Traps–the type example and the largest continental LIP–is located on thick cratonic lithosphere and was synchronous with the largest known mass-extinction event. However, there is no evidence of pre-magmatic uplift or of a large lithospheric stretching, as predicted above a plume head. Moreover, estimates of magmatic CO(2) degassing from the Siberian Traps are considered insufficient to trigger climatic crises, leading to the hypothesis that the release of thermogenic gases from the sediment pile caused the mass extinction. Here we present petrological evidence for a large amount (15 wt{\%}) of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume and develop a thermomechanical model that predicts no pre-magmatic uplift and requires no lithospheric extension. The model implies extensive plume melting and heterogeneous erosion of the thick cratonic lithosphere over the course of a few hundred thousand years. The model suggests that massive degassing of CO(2) and HCl, mostly from the recycled crust in the plume head, could alone trigger a mass extinction and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs.},

Molar concentrations of rare gases in the CO2-rich gases are approximately 5 orders of magnitude greater than in the waters and suggest that a near-surface Henry's Law fractionation has occurred between exsolving CO2 and water.$\delta$13C values of the CO2-rich gases are in the range −4.2 to −6.1‰, i.e. in that range normally attributed to mantle carbon, but which could also represent an average crustal composition and therefore do not discriminate between mantle and crustal sources.C/3He ratios show 4 orders of magnitude variation from 1.4 × 1012 to 5 × 108 and, compared to a mantleC/3He ratio of ∼ 109, indicate that either a complex fractionation has occurred between mantle helium and mantle CO2 or more likely that mantle rare gases have been diluted by large quantities of CO2 with an average crustal carbon isotope composition. The regional distribution of3He and C does not show any obvious relationship to age or proximity of volcanic centres or major faults, suggesting that mantle-derived C and He components decoupled from their silicate melt sources at some depth. The results from this area of active fluid circulation suggest that C-isotope data derived from metamorphic terrains should be interpreted with great caution, but that input of some mantle-derived carbon is expected to accompany crustal extension.},

abstract = {The intrinsic solidification behaviour and glass forming ability (GFA) of natural sub-alkaline silicate melts have been experimentally quantified via cooling-induced solidification approach. GFA is measured by the critical cooling rate Rc, the rate at which a melt solidifies ≤2area{\%} of crystals. Cooling rates of 9000, 1800, 180, 60, 7 and 1°C/h have been run between 1300°C (super-liquidus region) and 800°C (quenching temperature), at air fO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and ambient P for six silicate melts with compositions ranging from basalt (B) to rhyolite (R) (i.e., B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}60{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}60{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and water contents comprised between 53 (B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and 384 (B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) ppm. The ranges of cooling rates and chemical compositions used in this study are the broadest ever investigated in the Earth sciences. The phase proportions (area{\%}) were determined by image analysis on about 500 back-scattered electron images collected over different magnifications. Phases are glass, clinopyroxene (cpx), spinel (sp) and plagioclase (plg). Sp is ubiquitous with abundance of few area{\%} and nucleates earlier than silicate crystals. Cpx solidifies in all runs except in R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and its abundance follows asymmetric broad Gaussian-like trends (with tails towards low rates) as a function of cooling rate. Moving from B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}60{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} these trends conserve their shape but shift progressively to lower cooling rates and mineral abundances. Plg crystallises only at low cooling rates and in SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-poor compositions. Run-products with low amounts of crystals (≤5area{\%}) clearly show that cpx preferentially nucleates on surfaces of sp, whereas a significant crystallisation of cpx ({\textgreater}5area{\%}) is observed with decreasing cooling rate and with changing composition from B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. The crystallisation of silicate crystals is related to the chemical diffusivity of components in the melt. Also the initial crystallisation of plg occurs preferentially on cpx. In general, the amount of crystals decreases as the cooling rate increases; however, in some cases, the amount of crystals remains constant or even decreases for B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} with decreasing cooling rate.Rc values change over 5 orders of magnitude being {\textless}1, 7, 620, 3020, 8020 and 9000°C/h for R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}60{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}60{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}80{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}100{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, respectively. The variation of Rc can be modelled through NBO/T (nonbridging oxygen per tetrahedron) parameter by the following equation:Rc=a/{\{}1+e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-[(NBO/T-b)/c]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\}}, where a, b and c are fitting parameters equal to 9214, 0.297 and 0.040, respectively. Similarly to other glass-forming liquids (network, metallic and molecular systems), Rc for natural sub-alkaline silicate melts is inversely related to the reduced glass transition parameter Trg (Trg=Tg/Tm) and can be quantified with the equation Rc=a×Trg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-b{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, where a and b are 1.19×10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 28.7, respectively. These results may be used to retrieve the solidification conditions of aphyric, degassed and oxidised lavas; in addition, our data provide general constrains on the crystallisation kinetics of natural crystal-bearing silicate melts erupted on Earth (e.g. lavas with phenocrysts). The relationship between crystal content and cooling rate suggests that the solidification path induced by degassing can be also complex and nonlinear. The growth of crystals with size up to 1. mm from a nearly anhydrous superheated silicate melt indicates that variable cooling conditions of lavas have to be accounted to discriminate among minerals formed before, during and after eruptions. Moreover, our results can be used to design glass-ceramics from naturally available easy to find, low-cost starting materials.},

abstract = {This study presents an internally consistent model for the behavior of Fe3+/???Fe during partial melting of spinel lherzolite. The Fe3+/???Fe ratio for olivine is calculated on the basis of point defect thermodynamics, and the oxidation states of iron in the other solid phases are calculated using Fe3+/Fe2+ distribution between olivine and orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, or spinel. Conservation of mass is used to relate the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of partial melt to the concentrations of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in the initial and residual solids as a function of pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity. Results from isobaric batch melting calculations demonstrate that the Fe3+/???Fe ratio of the partial melt decreases with increasing melt fraction. Conversely, the Fe3+/???Fe ratio of the partial melt increases with increasing melt fraction during decompression batch melting. The relative oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle depends on both the oxidation state of iron and mantle potential temperature. Results from incremental decompression melting calculations in which 1{\%} melt is produced for each 100??MPa of decompression and then removed from the residual solid indicate that relative oxygen fugacity calculated from the oxidation state of iron in basaltic glass does not represent a unique value for the oceanic upper mantle but, rather, reflects conditions in the lower portion of the melting regime. A 100????C change in mantle potential temperature produces a change in relative oxygen fugacity of ???0.8??log??units, similar to the global range inferred from mid-ocean ridge basalt glasses. It is necessary, therefore, to compare relative oxygen fugacity calculated from basaltic glass with proxies for potential temperature before drawing conclusions on heterogeneity of the oxidation state of iron in the oceanic upper mantle. Results from model calculations also suggest that the sub-arc mantle is intrinsically more oxidizing than the oceanic mantle because it is cooler. The global correlation between Fe3+/???Fe and H2O in basaltic glasses may, in part, reflect the solidus-lowering influence of the latter. Secular variations in relative oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle due to cooling of the Earth over geologic time do not appear to be large enough to have influenced the nature of volcanic outgassing significantly enough to have contributed to the Great Oxidation Event.},

The qualitative stability relationships of naujakasite-bearing, low-variance liquidus mineral assemblages at near-solidus conditions in lujavritic magma can be modelled within the six-component system Si-Al-Fe-Na-O-H. The modelling suggests that an uncommon combination of elevated water activity and low oxygen fugacity is needed to stabilize arfvedsonite + naujakasite mineral assemblages in highly sodic liquids. These conditions are incompatible with the stable coexistence of aegirine and arfvedsonite. They are met in the arfvedsonite-bearing lujavrites of Il{\'{i}}maussaq, but apparently not in rocks of similar composition in the Khibina and Lovozero complexes, Kola Peninsula, where aegirine- or aegirine-arfvedsonite-bearing mineral assemblages are characteristic. Liquid lines of descent leading to crystallization of naujakasite have to pass through the albite+nepheline+arfvedsonite liquidus field in the Si-Al-Fe-Na-O-H system, reaching this field at the high-Na side of the albite-nepheline-arfvedsonite plane.},

abstract = {We conducted analog experiments using gum rosin–acetone (GRA) mixtures to approximate behavior of magmas containing dissolved and exsolved volatiles. The main objective was to investigate the role of pressure upon fragmentation behavior for GRA mixtures undergoing slow and fast decompressions. We found that under conditions of slow decompression (22–80 Pa s− 1), the GRA mixture never fragmented, exhibiting characteristic styles of surface degassing at different pressures. Under fast decompression (620–2400 kPa s− 1), fragmentation behavior was controlled principally by the initial volatile content of the GRA mixture, as well as by the extent and rate of decompression. Low-viscosity GRA mixtures with high levels of acetone fragmented efficiently at high final pressures, while viscous mixtures containing less acetone did not fragment except when subjected to small final pressures, high pressure differentials, and rapid decompression. Based on our observations, we propose that GRA mixtures near the fragmentation threshold are disrupted in a ductile fashion by intense vesiculation and bubble movements, while mixtures subject to elevated pressure differentials which are significantly higher than this threshold fragment in a brittle manner due to foam disruption. In non-fragmenting GRA mixtures, a form of stick–slip behavior was observed, the dynamics of which varied with the rheology of the mixture and the pressure differential applied during the decompression. In low-viscosity GRA mixtures, gas transfer occurred mainly in the form of gas bubbles and slugs which moved vertically upward through the material, creating permeable pathways to promote degassing and disruption of the mixture by bubble bursts. In viscous GRA mixtures dominated by foam development, vertical permeability gradients were observed, with a strongly degassed brittle foam at the top and a less degassed ductile foam beneath. Our observations have implications for submarine volcanism, volcanoes on Venus, and lava dome eruptions. For submarine volcanism, our experiments show that explosive fragmentation of magma may not be limited by water depth if the volatile content of the magma is sufficiently high (i.e., 4–6 wt.{\%} H2O). Our experimental results also suggest that the high-pressure atmospheric conditions of Venus (9300 kPa) are not an impediment to the explosive eruption of high volatile content magmas, which casts doubt on the interpretation of large-volume pancake lava domes on Venus as the high-pressure equivalent of terrestrial ignimbrite eruptions. Together with our experimental results, observations of actively growing lava domes demonstrate that explosive fragmentation is promoted by rapid, large-volume collapses of a dome, and by unroofed magma which is comparatively volatile-rich and vesicular.},

abstract = {Low-Ca pyroxenes play an important role in mantle melting, melt-rock reaction, and magma differen- tiation processes. In order to better understand REE fractionation during adiabatic mantle melting and pyroxe- nite-derived melt and peridotite interaction, we developed a parameterized model for REE partitioning between low- Ca pyroxene and basaltic melts. Our parameterization is based on the lattice strain model and a compilation of published experimental data, supplemented by a new set of trace element partitioning experiments for low-Ca pyrox- enes produced by pyroxenite-derived melt and peridotite interaction. To test the validity of the assumptions and simplifications used in the model development, we com- pared model-derived partition coefficients with measured partition coefficients for REE between orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in well-equilibrated peridotite xenoliths. REE partition coefficients in low-Ca pyroxene correlate negatively with temperature and positively with both cal- cium content on the M2 site and aluminum content on the tetrahedral site of pyroxene. The strong competing effect between temperature and major element compositions of low-Ca pyroxene results in very small variations in REE partition coefficients in orthopyroxene during adiabatic mantle melting when diopside is in the residue. REE par- tition coefficients in orthopyroxene can be treated as constants at a given mantle potential temperature during decompression melting of lherzolite and diopside-bearing harzburgite. In the absence of diopside, partition coeffi- cients of light REE in orthopyroxene vary significantly, and such variations should be taken into consideration in geo- chemical modeling of REE fractionation in clinopyroxene- free harzburgite. Application of the parameterized model to low-Ca pyroxenes produced by reaction between pyroxe- nite-derived melt and peridotite revealed large variations in the calculated REE partition coefficients in the low-Ca pyroxenes. Temperature and composition of starting pyroxenite must be considered when selecting REE parti- tion coefficients for pyroxenite-derived melt and peridotite interaction.},

abstract = {Mantle melting, which leads to the formation of oceanic and continental crust, together with crust recycling through plate tectonics, are the primary processes that drive the chemical differentiation of the silicate Earth. The present-day mantle, as sampled by oceanic basalts, shows large chemical and isotopic variability bounded by a few end-member compositions1. Among these, the HIMU end-member (having a high U/Pb ratio, $\mu$) has been generally considered to represent subducted/recycled basaltic oceanic crust2, 3, 4, 5. However, this concept has been challenged by recent studies of the mantle source of HIMU magmas. For example, analyses of olivine phenocrysts in HIMU lavas indicate derivation from the partial melting of peridotite, rather than from the pyroxenitic remnants of recycled oceanic basalt6. Here we report data that elucidate the source of these lavas: high-precision trace-element analyses of olivine phenocrysts point to peridotite that has been metasomatized by carbonatite fluids. Moreover, similarities in the trace-element patterns of carbonatitic melt inclusions in diamonds7 and HIMU lavas indicate that the metasomatism occurred in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, fused to the base of the continental crust and isolated from mantle convection. Taking into account evidence from sulfur isotope data8 for Archean to early Proterozoic surface material in the deep HIMU mantle source, a multi-stage evolution is revealed for the HIMU end-member, spanning more than half of Earth's history. Before entrainment in the convecting mantle, storage in a boundary layer, upwelling as a mantle plume and partial melting to become ocean island basalt, the HIMU source formed as Archean–early Proterozoic subduction-related carbonatite-metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle.},

abstract = {We have investigated trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and silicic melts ranging from 62 to 69 wt{\%} SiO2 in piston-cylinder experiments at 1.1 GPa and 1145-1155 degrees C. Run products consist of diopsidic clinopyroxene (with 3-5 wt{\%} Al2O3 and similar to 1 wt{\%} Na2O) coexisting with silicic, aluminous, and alkaline melts. Clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients for rare earth elemendts (REE) are significantly higher (e.g., D-Sm = 0.76 to 3.1) than previous studies of clinopyroxene-basaltic melt partitioning. The maximum D-REE is also shifted toward middle REE (e.g., Tb). Although the partition coefficients of Sr and Ti (D-Sr = 0.23-0.39, D-Ti = 0.28-1.0) are also elevated relative to clinopyroxene-basaltic melt, partition coefficients for Zr and Li (0.14-0.23 and 0.16-0.25, respectively) are within the range of literature values. The high partition coefficients for REE, Sr, and Ti in this study do not reflect crystal-compositional effects. For instance, no relationship is observed between Al-1V and these partition coefficients. REE and Ti partition coefficients correlate poorly with jadeite component of the clinopyroxene; however, the elevated Na2O contents of both the melt and clinopyroxene make it difficult to discriminate fully the effect of jadeite component from the effect of changes in melt structure. The non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation ratio (NBO/T; Mysen et al. 1985) varies from 0.08 to 0.17 and roughly correlates with D-epx/melt(REE), consistent with a recent study (Gaetani 2004) that concluded that melt structure significantly affects partitioning when NBO/T {\textless} 0.49. Notably, we find a strong correlation between the molar Ca2+/(M+ + M2+) of the melt and the optimum D (D-0) for the REE, indicating that melt structure, and not jadeite content, is the dominant control on clinopyroxene-melt partitioning in these experiments. The partition coefficients for the REE, Ti, Zr, and Sr are in good agreement with observed clinopyroxene-silicic glass partitioning within mantle xenoliths (Chazot et al. 1996; Vannucci et al. 1998), indicating these results may apply to lithospheric melting. Furthermore, the origin of hump-shaped REE patterns observed in residual clinopyroxene from abyssal peridotites could be explained if shallow depleted melts of peridotite are silica-rich. A two-stage fractional melting model assuming clinopyroxene-silicic melt partitioning at shallow mantle depths from 10 to 30 km beneath a mid-ocean ridge can reproduce the observed hump-shaped REE patterns. If so, hump-shaped REE patterns may provide evidence for the existence and extraction of silica-rich melt created in the shallow mantle.},

abstract = {Deccan Trap flood basalt volcanism reached its peak 65.5 (±1) million years ago, giving rise to a 2.7 km thick lava pile that formed the Western Ghats range near Mumbai. The total duration of this activity cannot be constrained better than ±1 Ma by conventional Ar-dating techniques. It is also difficult to know whether there were short bursts of tremendous volcanic activity within that period which could have significantly impacted global climate. Here we employ diffusion relaxation modeling of 87Sr/86Sr zoning in plagioclase to obtain a better resolution on the life cycle of a magma chamber in order to provide a minimum constraint on the duration of the Western Ghats volcanic episode.

The analyzed crystals are 2–5 cm long and occur in so-called Giant Plagioclase Basalt flows that mark the tops of the oldest formations of the Western Ghats. In the formation studied, such crystals may have recorded the life cycle of the magma chamber that fed the preceding flows. Our diffusion modeling yields 780 years for the maximum residence time for 5 cm long plagioclase crystals in the magma chamber and a mean growth rate of 2.03 × 10−10 cm s−1. Assuming continuous crystal growth while the underlying pile was being emplaced gives us a combined maximum rate of 0.13 m yr−1 for incubation and extrusion of the lava. Using this rate we estimate that the peak volcanic activity lasted a minimum of 21,100 years. A short duration for the Deccan would preclude AFC contamination processes during emplacement of the bulk of Deccan lavas.},

abstract = {The Maymecha-Kotuy area, comprising ∼70,000 km2 of the northern part of the Siberian flood-basalt province, is of unusual interest because it appears to be the only such province in the world where high-Ti, alkaline-ultramafic rocks with associated carbonatites predominate over basaltic extrusive and intrusive rocks. New field and geochemical studies of the igneous rocks of this area were initiated with the goals of (1) correlating them with the magmatic formations of the well-studied Noril'sk area and (2) reconstructing the entire magmatic evolution of Siberian flood-basalt volcanism. This report presents the first complete stratigraphic section for the volcanic sequence of the Maymecha River Basin (the most extensive in the Maymecha-Kotuy area), based on flow-by-flow mapping and sample collection. The geochemical and lithologic characteristics of the volcanic and intrusive rocks are thoroughly documented and show an unusually broad range in composition–e.g., SiO2 and MgO contents range from 40 to 70 and from {\textless}1 to 38 wt{\%}, respectively. New geochemical data, considered together with earlier paleomagnetic data, indicate that as much as 3000 m of the Maymecha-Kotuy sequence consists of lavas younger than those preserved near Noril'sk. Thus, the combined thickness of the lavas and tuffs that constitute the Siberian flood-basalt province is estimated as ∼6500 m. As at Noril'sk, the volcanic sequence lies with unconformity on sedimentary rocks of the Tungusskaya Series. At Maymecha, the sequence begins with a major, basaltic-tuff unit and an overlying suite of low-Ti, tholeiitic basalts, but the magmatism then became more diverse, with several alternations of low-Ti and high-Ti lavas, and evolved to eruption of high-Ti trachybasalts, melanephelinites, trachyandesites, trachytes, trachydacites, and trachyrhyodacites. The uppermost ∼1400 m of the sequence consists of high-Ti, limburgitic and picritic lavas, as well as Mg-rich (23 to 38 wt{\%}), high-Ti, meymechitic lavas, apparently unique in the world. Graphic evidence of the volcanic nature of the meymechites is presented here for the first time. The numerous dikes and several sills of the Maymecha River Basin are subdivided into seven types, which can be geochemically related to the volcanic sequence and in some cases can be reliably correlated with magmatic rocks of the Noril'sk area. Preliminary indications are that the complex body commonly referred to as the Guli intrusion is, in fact, an intrusive-volcanic complex occupying ∼2000 km2, in which a large, laccolithic intrusive mass of dunitic to peridotitic rocks was breached by a central volcanic edifice from which flowed ankaratrite and picritic ankaratrite lavas. Cutting the ankaratrites and picritic ankaratrites of the complex, but intimately related to it, is a variety of intrusive, alkaline rock types and two carbonatite bodies that may be related to a central feeder zone. We recognize four magma types as products of Siberian flood-basalt volcanism and refer to them herein as low-Ti-I, low-Ti-2, moderate-Ti, and high-Ti. In contrast to the Noril'sk area, where high-Ti magmas constitute {\textless}1 vol{\%} of the igneous rocks, their proportion is ∼50 vol{\%} in the Maymecha River Basin. These high-Ti rocks can be subdivided into trachybasaltic, melanephelinitic, and meymechitic rock series; clearly related to these series, judging from trace-element characteristics, are associated trachyandesitic, trachytic, and felsic lavas. In general, the trachyandesitic, trachytic, and felsic lavas appear to be related to the trachybasaltic series through fractionation, but some of the felsic tuffs display characteristics that suggest their relation to the melanephelinitie series. Previous investigators have concluded that meymechitic magma formed by low degrees of mantle-peridotite melting ({\textless}7{\%}) at pressures corresponding to depths of 250 to 300 km. The distinctions between the trachybasaltic, melanephelinitic, and meymechitic rock series must relate to different sources and conditions of melting. It is remarkable that no geochemical signature of crustal contamination can be recognized for any of the high-Ti rocks, including the felsic lavas and tuffs. We conclude that the alternation of low-Ti and high-Ti magma types observed in the lower half of the volcanic sequence in the Maymecha River Basin resulted from repetitive expulsion from discrete mantle sources through independent plumbing systems.},

abstract = {Field observations and solubility experiments show evidence for the efficient mobilization of nominally insoluble HFSE (i.e., Ti, Zr, Nb and Hf) by high pressure fluids, probably via complexation with polymerized alkali–silica dissolved species and halogens (F and Cl). Here we investigate the complexation of Zr in subduction-related fluids (aqueous fluids and hydrous haplogranite melts) up to 800 °C and 2.4 GPa using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell and provide evidence for the formation of Zr–O–Si/Na polymeric species in alkali-(alumino)silicate fluids at high pressure. Zr4+ speciation in dilute fluids (2.5 wt{\%} HCl) is dominated by 8-fold-coordinated [Zr(H2O)8]4+ hydrated complexes at room conditions and no evidence for extensive Zr–Cl complexation in the fluid was found up to 420 °C, as confirmed by ab initio XANES calculations of various ZrO8−xClx clusters. The addition of Na and Si dissolved species (from 35 to 60 wt{\%} dissolved Na2Si2O5, NS2) into the fluid favors the formation of alkali-zirconosilicate clusters Zr–O–Si/Na similar to those found in vlasovite (Na2ZrSi4O11), with Zr4+ in octahedral coordination with oxygen (Zr–O distance = 2.09 ± 0.04 {\AA}) and ∼6 Si (Na) second neighbors (Zr–Si/Na distance = 3.66 ± 0.06 {\AA}). This coordination environment also dominates Zr speciation in F-free and F-bearing NS2 and haplogranite glasses and high pressure hydrous haplogranite melts (15.5–33 wt{\%} dissolved H2O) in the investigated pressure–temperature range. The XAS analyses, assisted by ab initio XANES calculations, are not conclusive concerning the extent of Zr–F complexation in hydrous granitic melts. Alkali-zirconosilicate Zr–O–Si/Na clusters such as those identified in this study may explain the enhanced solubility of zircon ZrSiO4 (and other HFSE-bearing minerals) in alkali-aluminosilicate-bearing aqueous fluids produced by dehydration and melting of the slab and provide a favorable mechanism for the mobilization of HFSE in subduction zones. Fluid–rock interactions and/or P/T variations as fluids migrate through the mantle wedge could affect the stability of these complexes, triggering the precipitation of HFSE-bearing accessory phases that are eventually recycled into the mantle, contributing to the dispersion of HFSE. These processes provide a possible explanation for the characteristic HFSE depletion recorded in arc magmas.},

Komatiites from Gorgona Island were formed by relatively low degrees of pseudoinvariant melting ({\textless} 30{\%}) involving L + Ol + Opx + Cpx + Gt on the solidus at 40 kbar, about 130 km depth. Munro-type komatiites were separated from a harzburgite residue (L + Ol + Opx) at pressures that are poorly constrained, but were probably around 50 kbar, about 165 km depth; the degree of partial melting was {\textless}40{\%}. Komatiites from the Barberton Mountain Land were formed by high degrees (∼50{\%}) of pseudoinvariant melting (L + Ol + Gt + Cpx) of fertile mantle peridotite in the 80- to 100-kbar range, about 260- to 330- km depth. Secular variations in the geochemistry of komatiites could have formed in response to a reduction in the temperature and pressure of melting with time. The 3.5 Ga Barberton komatiites and the 2.7 Ga Munro-type komatiites could have formed in plumes that were hotter than the present-day mantle by 500° and 300°, respectively. When excess temperatures are this size, melting is deeper and volcanism changes from basaltic to komatiitic. The komatiites from Gorgona Island, which are Mesozoic in age, may be representative of komatiites that are predicted to occur in oceanic plateaus of Cretaceous age throughout the Pacific [Storey et al., 1991].},

abstract = {Several types of fluid immiscibility may affect the evolution of volatile-rich magmatic systems at the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. The topology of silicate-salt-H2O systems implies that three-fluid immiscibility (silicate melt+hydrosaline melt+vapour) should be stable in a broad range of compositions and P - T conditions. The most important factor controlling the immiscibility appears to be the Coulombic properties (electric charges Z and ionic radii r) of the main network-modifying cations and the capacity for immiscibility appears to decrease in the following sequence: Mg{\textgreater}Ca{\textgreater}Sr{\textgreater}Ba{\textgreater}Li{\textgreater}Na{\textgreater}K. Liquid immiscibility is enhanced in peralkaline compositions and in the presence of nonsilicate anions such as F-, Cl-, CO32- and BO33-. In volatile-rich magmatic systems, the H2O is likely to react with the chloride, fluoride, borate and carbonate species and the chemical effects of high-temperature hydrolysis may be greatly enhanced by phase separation in systems with multiple immiscible fluid phases. Natural granitic magmas can thus exsolve a range of chemically and physically diverse hydrosaline liquids and the role of these fluid phases is likely to be especially significant in pegmatites and Li-F rare-metal granites. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Early Cretaceous tholeiitic picrite-to-rhyolite dykes around Spitzkoppe, western Namibia, are part of the extensive Henties Bay–Outjo swarm, penecontemporaneous with 132 Ma Etendeka lavas 100 km to the NW. Although only intermediate to rhyolitic dykes contain clinopyroxene phenocrysts, the behaviour of Ca, Al and Sc in the dyke suite shows that liquidus clinopyroxene—together with olivine—was a fractionating phase when MgO fell to 9 wt {\%}. Both a plot of CIPW normative di–hy–ol–ne–Q and modelling using (p)MELTS show that a mid-crustal pressure of 0{\textperiodcentered}6 GPa is consistent with this early clinopyroxene saturation. Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotope variations all show trends consistent with AFC contamination (assimilation linked to fractional crystallization), involving Pan-African Damara belt continental crust. The geochemical variation, including isenthalpic AFC modelling using (p)MELTS, suggests that the picrites (olivine-rich cumulate suspensions) were interacting with granulite-facies metamorphic lower crust, the intermediate compositions with amphibolite-facies middle crust, and the rhyolitic dykes (and a few of the basalts) with the Pan-African granites of the upper crust. The calculated densities of the magmas fall systematically from picrite to rhyolite and suggest a magmatic system resembling a stack of sills throughout the crust beneath Spitzkoppe, with the storage and fractionation depth of each magma fraction controlled by its density. Elemental and isotopic features of the 20 wt {\%} MgO picrites (including Os isotopes) suggest that their parental melts probably originated by fusion of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) source convecting mantle, followed by limited reaction with sub-continental lithospheric mantle metasomatized just prior to the formation of the parental magmas. Many of the distinctive features of large-volume picritic–basaltic magmas may not be derived from their ultimate mantle sources, but may instead be the results of complex polybaric fractional crystallization and multi-component crustal contamination.},

abstract = {Apatite-group phosphates are nearly ubiquitous in carbonatites, but our understanding of these minerals is inadequate, particularly in the areas of element partitioning and petrogenetic interpretation of their compositional variation among spatially associated rocks and within individual crystals. In the present work, the mode of occurrence, and major- and trace-element chemistry of apatite (sensu lato) from calcite and dolomite carbonatites, their associated cumulate rocks (including phoscorites) and hydrothermal parageneses were studied using a set of 80 samples from 50 localities worldwide. The majority of this set represents material for which no analytical data are available in the literature. Electron-microprobe and laser-ablation mass-spectrometry data ({\~{}}600 and 400 analyses, respectively), accompanied by back-scattered-electron and cathodoluminescence images and Raman spectra, were used to identify the key compositional characteristics and zoning patterns of carbonatitic apatite. These data are placed in the context of phosphorus geochemistry in carbonatitic systems and carbonatite evolution, and compared to the models proposed by previous workers. The documented variations in apatite morphology and zoning represent a detailed record of a wide range of evolutionary processes, both magmatic and fluid-driven. The majority of igneous apatite from the examined rocks is Cl-poor fluorapatite or F-rich hydroxylapatite (≥0.3apfu F) with 0.2–2.7wt.{\%} SrO, 0–4.5wt.{\%} LREE2O3, 0–0.8wt.{\%} Na2O, and low levels of other cations accommodated in the Ca site (up to 1000ppm Mn, 2300ppm Fe, 200ppm Ba, 150ppm Pb, 700ppm Th and 150ppm U), none of which show meaningful correlation with the host-rock type. Silicate, (SO4)2− and (VO4)3− anions, substituting for (PO4)3−, tend to occur in greater abundance in crystals from calcite carbonatites (up to 4.2wt.{\%} SiO2, 1.5wt.{\%} SO3 and 660ppm V). Although (CO3)2− groups are very likely present in some samples, Raman micro-spectroscopy proved inconclusive for apatites with small P-site deficiencies and other substituent elements in this site. Indicator REE ratios sensitive to redox conditions ($\delta$Ce, $\delta$Eu) and hydrothermal overprint ($\delta$Y) form a fairly tight cluster of values (0.8–1.3, 0.8–1.1 and 0.6–0.9, respectively) and may be used in combination with trace-element abundances for the development of geochemical exploration tools. Hydrothermal apatite forms in carbonatites as the product of replacement of primary apatite, or is deposited in fractures and interstices as euhedral crystals and aggregates associated with typical late-stage minerals (e.g., quartz and chlorite). Hydrothermal apatite is typically depleted in Sr, REE, Mn and Th, but enriched in F (up to 4.8wt.{\%}) relative to its igneous precursor, and also differs from the latter in at least some of key REE ratios [e.g., shows (La/Yb)cn≤25, or a negative Ce anomaly]. The only significant exception is Sr(± REE,Na)-rich replacement zones and overgrowths on igneous apatite from some dolomite(-bearing) carbonatites. Their crystallization conditions and source fluid appear to be very different from the more common Sr-REE-depleted variety. Based on the new evidence presented in this work, trace-element partitioning between apatite and carbonatitic magmas, phosphate solubility in these magmas, and compositional variation of apatite-group minerals from spatially associated carbonatitic rocks are critically re-evaluated.},

abstract = {Carbonatites are commonly related to the accumulation of economically valuable substances such as REE, Cu, and P. The debate over the origin of carbonatites and their relationship to associated silicate rocks has been ongoing for about 45 years. Worldwide, the rocks characteristically display more geochemical enrichments in Ba, Sr and REE than sedimentary carbonate rocks. However, carbonatite's geochemical features are disputed because of secondary mineral effects. Rock-forming carbonates from carbonatites at Qinling, Panxi region, and Bayan Obo in China show REE distribution patterns ranging from LREE enrichment to flat patterns. They are characterized by a Sr content more than 10 times higher than that of secondary carbonates. The coarse- and fine-grained dolomites from Bayan Obo H8 dolomite marbles also show similar high Sr abundance, indicating that they are of igneous origin. Some carbonates in Chinese carbonatites show REE (especially HREE) contents and distribution patterns similar to those of the whole rocks. These intrusive carbonatites display lower platinum group elements and stronger fractionation between Pt and Ir relative to high-Si extrusive carbonatite. This indicates that most intrusive carbonatites may be carbonate cumulates. Maoniuping and Daluxiang in Panxi region are large REE deposits. Hydrothermal fluorite ore veins occur outside of the carbonatite bodies and are emplaced in wallrock syenite. The fluorite in Maoniuping has Sr and Nd isotopes similar to carbonatite. The Daluxiang fluorite shows Sr and REE compositions different from those in Maoniuping. The difference is reflected by both the carbonatites and rock-forming carbonates, indicating that REE mineralization is related to carbonatites. The cumulate processes of carbonate minerals make fractionated fluids rich in volatiles and LREE as a result of low partition coefficients for REE between carbonate and carbonatite melt and an increase from LREE to HREE. The carbonatite-derived fluid has interacted with wallrock to form REE ore veins. The amount of carbonatite dykes occurring near the Bayan Obo orebodies may support the same mineralization model, i.e. that fluids evolved from the carbonatite dykes reacted with H8 dolomite marble, and thus the different REE and isotope compositions of coarse- and fine-grained dolomite may be related to reaction processes. {\textcopyright} 2010, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

abstract = {Zircon textures and composition have been used to infer magmatic processes including closed-system fractional crystallization, magma mixing or replenishment, and country-rock assimilation. Here, we propose that zircon textures and composition may also be refractory recorders of magmatic volatile evolution. We present field, whole-rock chemical, textural, mineral chemical, and U–Pb age data from evolved, fine-to-coarse-grained granite intrusions on Melville Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada. Zircon forms two main populations in these granites, Type-1 and Type-2 zircon. Type-1 zircon is present in all samples, but predominant in fine-grained granite. Crystals are euhedral and inclusion-rich and show periodic, fine-scale oscillatory zoning, comparatively low concentrations of U ({\textless}2,200 ppm) and Hf ({\textless}1.6 wt{\%}), high Zr/Hf ({\~{}}40–62), and pervasive alteration. Type-2 zircon is predominant in coarse-grained granite. Crystals form overgrowths on Type-1 zircon and individual crystals. They are subhedral and inclusion-poor and show weak, irregular, large-scale oscillatory zoning, high U (up to {\~{}}7,250 ppm) and Hf (1.5–2.0 wt{\%}), low Zr/Hf ({\~{}}37–44), and only local alteration. Compatible trace-element concentrations and Zr/Hf change sharply across the boundary of Type-1 to Type-2 zircon; 207Pb/206Pb ages preclude a significant hiatus between crystallization of the two types. We argue against magmatic versus hydrothermal crystallization, country-rock assimilation, or magma mixing as causes for the crystallization of Type-1 and Type-2 zircon. We propose instead that Type-1 zircon formed from volatile-undersaturated magmas and that Type-2 zircon formed from volatile-saturated magmas. Magmas fractionated by volatile-driven filter pressing into crystal-rich mush and crystal-poor magma. Crystal-rich mush with abundant Type-1 zircon crystallized to fine-grained granite. Volatile-rich magma crystallized to Type-2 zircon and coarse-grained granite. While Type-1 zircon was pervasively altered by exsolving magmatic volatiles, Type-2 zircon was only locally affected by subsolidus hydrothermal alteration.},

abstract = {The Puklen complex of the Mid-Proterozoic Gardar Province, South Greenland, consists of various silica-saturated to quartz-bearing syenites, which are intruded by a peralkaline granite. The primary mafic minerals in the syenites are augite ± olivine + Fe–Ti oxide + amphibole. Ternary feldspar thermometry and phase equilibria among mafic silicates yield T = 950–750°C, aSiO2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}7–1 and an fO2 of 1–3 log units below the fayalite–magnetite–quartz (FMQ) buffer at 1 kbar. In the granites, the primary mafic minerals are ilmenite and Li-bearing arfvedsonite, which crystallized at temperatures below 750°C and at fO2 values around the FMQ buffer. In both rock types, a secondary post-magmatic assemblage overprints the primary magmatic phases. In syenites, primary Ca-bearing minerals are replaced by Na-rich minerals such as aegirine–augite and albite, resulting in the release of Ca. Accordingly, secondary minerals include ferro-actinolite, (calcite–siderite)ss, titanite and andradite in equilibrium with the Na-rich minerals. Phase equilibria indicate that formation of these minerals took place over a long temperature interval from near-magmatic temperatures down to ∼300°C. In the course of this cooling, oxygen fugacity rose in most samples. For example, late-stage aegirine in granites formed at the expense of arfvedsonite at temperatures below 300°C and at an oxygen fugacity above the haematite–magnetite (HM) buffer. The calculated $\delta$18Omelt value for the syenites (+5{\textperiodcentered}9 to +6{\textperiodcentered}3‰) implies a mantle origin, whereas the inferred $\delta$18Omelt value of {\textless}+5{\textperiodcentered}1‰ for the granitic melts is significantly lower. Thus, the granites require an additional low-$\delta$18O contaminant, which was not involved in the genesis of the syenites. Rb/Sr data for minerals of both rock types indicate open-system behaviour for Rb and Sr during post-magmatic metasomatism. Neodymium isotope compositions ($\epsilon$Nd1170 Ma = −3{\textperiodcentered}8 to −6{\textperiodcentered}4) of primary minerals in syenites are highly variable, and suggest that assimilation of crustal rocks occurred to variable extents. Homogeneous $\epsilon$Nd values of −5{\textperiodcentered}9 and −6{\textperiodcentered}0 for magmatic amphibole in the granites lie within the range of the syenites. Because of the very similar neodymium isotopic compositions of magmatic and late- to post-magmatic minerals from the same syenite samples a principally closed-system behaviour during cooling is implied. In contrast, for the granites an externally derived fluid phase is required to explain the extremely low $\epsilon$Nd values of about −10 and low $\delta$18O between +2{\textperiodcentered}0 and +0{\textperiodcentered}5‰ for late-stage aegirine, indicating an open system in the late-stage history. In this study we show that the combination of phase equilibria constraints with stable and radiogenic isotope data on mineral separates can provide much better constraints on magma evolution during emplacement and crystallization than conventional whole-rock studies.},

The use of compositionally simple tourmalines characterized by electron microprobe analysis facilitates the determination of site occupancy in the SREF and band assignment in the Raman spectra. The synthesized K-dravite, oxy-uvite, and magnesio-foitite have significant Mg–Al disorder between their octahedral sites indicated by their respective average 〈Y–O〉 and 〈Z–O〉 bond lengths. The Y- and Z-site compositions of oxy-uvite (YMg1.52Al1.48(10) and ZAl4.90Mg1.10(15)) and magnesio-foitite (YAl1.62Mg1.38(18) and ZAl4.92Mg1.08(24)) are refined from the electron densities at each site. The Mg–Al ratio of the Y and Z sites is also determined from the relative integrated peak intensities of the Raman bands in the O–H stretching vibrational range (3250–3850 cm−1), producing values in good agreement with the SREF data. The unit cell volume of tourmaline increases from magnesio-foitite (1558.4(3) {\AA}3) to dravite (1569.5(4)–1571.7(3) {\AA}3) to oxy-uvite (1572.4(2) {\AA}3) to K-dravite (1588.1(2) {\AA}3), mainly due to lengthening of the crystallographic c-axis. The increase in the size of the X-site coordination polyhedron from dravite (Na) to K-dravite (K) is accommodated locally in the crystal structure, resulting in the shortening of the neighboring O1–H1 bond. In oxy-uvite, Ca2+ is locally associated with a deprotonated W (O1) site, whereas vacant X sites are neighbored by protonated W (O1) sites. Increasing the size of the X-site-occupying ion does not detectably affect bonding between the other sites; however, the higher charge of Ca and the deprotonated W (O1) site in oxy-uvite are correlated to changes in the lattice vibration Raman spectrum (100–1200 cm−1), particularly for bands assigned to the T 6O18 ring. The Raman spectrum of magnesio-foitite shows significant deviations from those of K-dravite, dravite, and oxy-uvite in both the lattice and O–H stretching vibrational ranges (100–1200 and 3250–3850 cm−1, respectively). The vacant X site is correlated with long- and short-range changes in the crystal structure, i.e., deformation of the T 6O18 ring and lengthening of the O1–H1 and O3–H3 bonds. However, X-site vacancies in K-dravite, dravite, and oxy-uvite result only in the lengthening of the neighboring O1–H1 bond and do not result in identifiable changes in the lattice-bonding environment.},

abstract = {Garnet is the most commonly used mineral in thermobarometry, whereas zircon is the most robust chronometer to date high-grade metamorphic rocks. To provide a basis for correlation of zircon and garnet growth, we determined experimentally the trace element partitioning between zircon, a hydrous granitic melt and garnet at 20 kbar and 800–1000 °C for P, Y, rare earth elements (REE), Zr, Hf, Th and U. In respect to melt, zircon preferentially incorporates all investigated elements apart from REE with atomic number lower than Sm. At this pressure and in the chosen composition, the distribution coefficient between zircon and melt (DZrn/Melt) for REE increases with increasing atomic number of the REE and with decreasing temperature. DYbZrn/Melt is ∼ 20 at 1000 °C, but more than an order of magnitude higher at 800 °C. The solubility of Zr in hydrous granitic melts buffered by zircon is about a factor of two lower at 20 kbar than what has been previously established for mid-crustal pressures. Large garnet produced in the experiments allowed determination of garnet/melt trace element partitioning (DGrt/Melt) at temperatures of 800–1000 °C, conditions relevant for partial melting of crustal rocks. There is a systematic increase in DREEGrt/Melt with decreasing temperature. Zircon contains significantly more heavy-REE than garnet at temperatures of 800–850 °C. Zircon/garnet partition coefficients of heavy-REE decrease with increasing temperature from DLuZrn/Melt of 12 at 800 °C to 1.4 at 1000 °C. Middle-REE partitioning is close to unity for the whole investigated temperature range. Different empirically determined zircon/garnet partition coefficients from granulites and ultra-high temperature granulites can potentially be explained by the experimentally determined change of partitioning as a function of temperature. These data can assist in establishing equilibrium between garnet and zircon zones in natural rocks, and in the construction of detailed pressure–temperature–time paths in high-grade metamorphic rocks.},

abstract = {The Earth's mantle is currently oxidised and out of chemical equilibrium with the core. The reasons for this and for the relatively oxidised state of Earth's mantle relative to the mantles of other terrestrial planets are unclear. It has been proposed that the oxidised nature and high ferric iron (Fe3 +) content of Earth's mantle was produced internally by disproportionation of ferrous iron (Fe2 +) into Fe3 + and metallic iron by perovskite crystallisation during accretion. Here we show that there is substantial Fe isotope fractionation between experimentally equilibrated metal and Fe3 +-bearing perovskite (≥ 0.45‰/amu), which can account for the heavy Fe isotope compositions of terrestrial basalts relative to equivalent samples derived from Mars and Vesta as the latter bodies are too small to stabilise significant perovskite. Mass balance calculations indicate that all of the mantle's Fe3 + could readily have been generated from a single disproportionation event, consistent with dissolution of perovskite in the lower mantle during a process such as the Moon-forming giant impact. The similar Fe isotope compositions of primitive terrestrial and low-titanium lunar basalts is consistent with models of equilibration between the mantles of the Earth and Moon in the aftermath of the giant impact and suggests that the heavy Fe isotope composition of the Earth's mantle was established prior to, or during the giant impact. The oxidation state and ferric iron content of the Earth's mantle was therefore plausibly set by the end of accretion, and may be decoupled from later volatile additions and the rise of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere at 2.45 Ga.},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract = {The Tamazert Eocene alkaline complex of the Central High Atlas Range of Morocco hosts the largest outcropping occurrences of carbonatites in northern Africa. The complex consists of carbonatites and undersaturated ultramafic to syenitic alkaline to peralkaline silicate rocks. Mineralogically and geochemically the Tamazert carbonatites are classified as calciocarbonatites, magnesiocarbonatites and silicocarbonatites. They are enriched in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements (Cs, Rb, Ba, U, Th), but depleted in high field strength elements (particularly, Ti, Nb and Ta). Stable and radiogenic isotope ratios vary in the range of delta C-13(PDB) = -5 center dot 8 to 1 center dot 8 parts per thousand, delta O-18(SMOW) = 6 center dot 9-23 center dot 5 parts per thousand, initial Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0 center dot 7031-0 center dot 7076, Nd-143/Nd-144 = 0 center dot 5125-0 center dot 5129 and Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18 center dot 29-19 center dot 89. Calciocarbonatites intruding Jurassic limestones have the highest delta C-13 and delta O-18 values and the most radiogenic initial Sr-87/Sr-86, but least radiogenic Nd-143/Nd-144, Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 isotope ratios, and are interpreted to have interacted with the limestones (crustal components). The magnesio- and silicocarbonatites have Sr, Nd and Pb isotope ratios that are nearly identical to those of low-Sr-87/Sr-86 calciocarbonatites. The isotope signature of the high-Sr, low-Sr-87/Sr-86 calciocarbonatites with mantle-type O and C isotopic compositions indicates the presence of HIMU- and EMI-type components in the mantle source of the Tamazert carbonatites, similar to what has been proposed for the Cape Verde and Canary Islands. The close similarity in carbonatite composition between the Cape Verde and Canary Islands and Tamazert suggests a common sublithospheric source for these carbonatites. We therefore propose that the Tamazert carbonatites originated through melting of Canary plume material that may have flowed through a sub-lithospheric corridor extending from the Atlantic near the Canary Islands to the Middle Atlas, formed by the delamination of the subcontinental lithosphere in response to Africa-Europe collision at c. 42 Ma. Seismic tomography data suggest that the common source may be within the lower mantle at depths {\textgreater} 1000 km.},

abstract = {We report 40Ar/39Ar ages from various tectonic units in the Aegean and westernmost Turkey. On the basis of published geochronologic data and our 40Ar/39Ar ages we propose that the Aegean is made up of several high-pressure units, which were successively underplated from the Late Cretaceous until the Miocene. Ages for high-pressure metamorphism range from 80–83 Ma in parts of the Vardar-Izmir-Ankara suture zone in the north to 21–24 Ma for the Basal unit in the Cyclades and the external high-pressure belt on Crete in the south. Published seismic data suggest that high-pressure metamorphism is currently occurring underneath Crete. Younging of high-pressure metamorphism in a southerly direction mimics the southward retreat of the Hellenic subduction zone. We propose that distinct stages of high-pressure metamorphism were controlled by the underthrusting of fragments of mainly thinned continental crust and that these punctuated events were superposed on progressive slab retreat. By far most of the exhumation of the high-pressure units occurred early during the orogenic history in a forearc position.},

abstract = {Despite extensive industrial application, global scandium resources are uncertain. Although Sc is mainly supplied as a by-product of mining of rare earth metals, uranium or aluminum, it is also concentrated by carbonatite process, both magmatic and post-magmatic. In this paper, we report data on Sc distribution within the Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit (phoscorite-carbonatite pipe) in the Murmansk Region of Russia, which seems to be a significant reservoir of this "strategic" metal. We show that baddeleyite is the main Sc-concentrating mineral, and reveal the spatial distribution of Sc-bearing baddeleyite within the Kovdor phoscorite-carbonatite pipe. The scandium content in baddeleyite differs according to the petrographic zonation of the pipe culminating in the inner (axial) zone of the pipe and in dolomite carbonatites cutting the pipe. We have estimated the amount of Sc2O3in the Kovdor deposit as amounting to 420t at average content in baddeleyite of 0.078wt.{\%}, and revealed the economic potential for Sc recovery as a by-product. Other Sc-bearing minerals - pyrochlore and ilmenite groups, zirconolite, and juonniite - have been described and opportunity of Sc recovery was examined, too.},

abstract = {The lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton changed dramatically in its geophysical and geochemical characteristics from Palaeozoic to Cenozoic times. This study uses samples of Mesozoic basalts and mafic intrusions from the North China Craton to investigate the nature of this mantle in Mesozoic times. Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic data demonstrate that the Late Mesozoic lithospheric mantle was extremely heterogeneous. In the central craton or the Luzhong region, it is slightly Sr–Nd isotopically enriched, beneath the Taihangshan region it has an EM1 character (87Sr/86Sri = 0.7050–0.7066; $\epsilon$Nd(t) = −17– −10), and beneath the Luxi–Jiaodong region, it possesses EM2-like characteristics (87Sr/86Sri up to 0.7114). Compositional variation with time is also apparent in the Mesozoic lithospheric mantle. Our data suggest that the old lithospheric mantle was modified during Mesozoic times by a silicic melt, where beneath the Luxi–Jiaodong region it was severely modified, but in the Luzhong and Taihangshan regions the effects were much less marked. The silicic melt may have been the product of partial melting of crustal materials brought into the mantle by the subducted slab during the formation of circum-cratonic orogenic belts. This Mesozoic mantle did not survive for a long time, and was replaced by a Cenozoic mantle with depleted geochemical characteristics.},

abstract = {The Rockeskyll complex in the north, central part of the Quaternary West Eifel volcanic field encapsulates an association of carbonatite, nephelinite and phonolite. The volcanic complex is dominated by three eruptive centres, which are distinct in their magma chemistry and their mode of emplacement. The Auf Dickel diatreme forms one centre and has erupted the only known carbonatite in the West Eifel, along with a broad range of alkaline rock types. Extrusive carbonatitic volcanism is represented by spheroidal autoliths, which preserve an equilibrium assemblage. The diatreme has also erupted xenoliths of calcite-bearing feldspathoidal syenite, phonolite and sanidine and clinopyroxene megacrysts, which are interpreted as fragments of a sub-volcanic complex. The carbonate phase of volcanism has several manifestations; extrusive lapilli, recrystallized ashes and calcite-bearing syenites, fragmented during diatreme emplacement. A petrogenetic link between carbonatites and alkali mafic magmas is confirmed from Sr and Nd isotope systematics, and an upper mantle origin for the felsic rocks is suggested. The chemistry and mineralogy of mantle xenoliths erupted throughout the West Eifel indicate enrichment in those elements incompatible in the mantle. In addition, the evidence from trace element signatures and melts trapped as glasses support interaction between depleted mantle and small volume carbonate and felsic melts. This close association between carbonate and felsic melts in the mantle is mirrored in the surface eruptives of Auf Dickel and at numerous alkaline-carbonatite provinces worldwide.},

abstract = {Approximately 0.4{\%} of explosive volcanic eruptions occur within a few days of large, distant earthquakes. This many ?triggered? eruptions is much greater than expected by chance. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain triggering through changes in magma overpressure, including the growth of bubbles, the advection of large pressures by rising bubbles, and overturn of magma chambers. Alternatively, triggered eruptions may occur through failure of rocks surrounding stored magma. All these mechanisms require a process that enhances small static stress changes caused by earthquakes or that can convert (the larger) transient, dynamic strains into permanent changes in pressure. All proposed processes, in addition to viscoelastic relaxation of stresses, can result in delayed triggering of eruptions, although quantifying the connection between earthquakes and delayed, triggered eruptions is much more challenging. Mud volcanoes and geysers also respond to distant earthquakes. Mud volcanoes that discharge mud from depths greater than many hundreds of meters may be triggered by liquefaction caused by shaking, and may thus be similar to small mud volcanoes that originate within a few meters of the surface. Changes in permeability of the matrix surrounding main geyser conduits, by opening or creating new fractures, may explain the observed changes in their eruption frequency.},

abstract = {Petrogenetic modeling of the Recent lava succession of Santa Barbara and Pico Alto volcanoes and associated basaltic lavas indicates that there are two discrete lava series present, one erupted from the axial rift linking the two central volcanoes and one associated with monogenetic cones scattered around the flanks of Santa Barbara. The felsic lavas of both volcanoes are peralkaline and appear to be derived from associated basalts by fractional crystallization of an assemblage including essential amphibole. Trace element abundances in the felsic lavas, particularly those of Sr and REE, cannot be reconciled with an origin through partial melting of basaltic material at the base of the volcanic pile. The difference between the comenditic and pantelleritic differentiation trends of Santa Barbara and Pico Alto is attributed primarily to FO2 control of the crystallizing assemblage, probably related to thermal dissociation of magmatic water in the Santa Barbara magma chamber. This effect may be augmented by minor differences in parent basaltic compositions, the Pico Alto pantellerites being derived from the rift basalts whereas the Santa Barbara comendites are derived from the off-rift basalts. A compositional gap between 54 and 64{\%} silica content in the lavas is not present if the suite is extended to include co-magmatic hypabyssal xenoliths, leading to the inference that the gap in this and other bimodal suites results solely from a relative inability of magma of intermediate composition to erupt.},

abstract = {This work presents the first sulfur isotope data for the Tapira, Arax{\'{a}}, Salitre, Serra Negra, Catal{\~{a}}o I and Catal{\~{a}}o II alkaline-carbonatite complexes of the Alto Paranaiba Igneous Province (APIP) and the Jacupiranga complex of the Ponta Grossa Province, in central and southeast Brazil, respectively. The APIP complexes are composed of alkaline silicate rocks (bebedourite, alkali clinopyroxenite, minor syenite), phoscorites, nelsonites, and carbonatites. The Jacupiranga complex is composed of ijolite-series rocks, syenites, carbonatites and alkaline gabbros. Many of these rocks contain sulfides and the carbonatites contain both sulfides and sulfates.Although there is extensive overlap, the $\delta$34S decreases in sulfides from ultramafic rocks through phoscorites to carbonatites in each complex. Initially, this variation may be controlled by the temperature dependence of the sulfur isotope fractionation between crystallizing sulfides and magma, but in later stages it is dominated by the increasing oxidation state of the magma and crystallization of 34S-enriched sulfate minerals.Core to rim isotopic variation in quenched individual pyrite crystals indicates that $\delta$34S increases with degassing. Metasomatic sulfides have low $\delta$34S, resulting from the interaction of late-stage carbonatite fluids with the host rock.On a regional scale, the APIP complexes have a wider sulfur isotopic range than Jacupiranga, suggesting a more extensive interplay between magma evolution, degassing and metasomatism, probably due to a shallower emplacement of the APIP intrusions and/or a less evolved character of the Jacupiranga magmas.Sulfur isotope ranges for the studied complexes are comparable with other worldwide carbonatite and alkaline provinces, but the APIP results extend to lower $\delta$34S. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The partitioning of trace elements between crystals and melts provides an important petrogenetic tool for understanding magmatic processes. We present trace element partition coefficients measured between clinopyroxene phenocrysts and trachy-phonolitic magmas at the Campi Flegrei (Italy), whose late Quaternary volcanism has been characterized by two major caldera-forming events (Campanian Ignimbrite at {\~{}}39 ka, and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff at {\~{}}15 ka). Our data indicate that the increase of trivalent rare earth elements and yttrium into the crystal lattice M2 site is facilitated by the charge-balancing substitution of Si4+ with Al3+ on the tetrahedral site. Higher concentrations of tetravalent and pentavalent high field strength elements on the M1 site are also measured when the average charge on this site is increased by the substitution of divalent cations by Alvi. In contrast, due to these charge balance requirements, divalent transitional elements become less compatible within the crystal lattice. On the basis of the lattice strain theory, we document that the incorporation of rare earth elements and yttrium in clinopyroxene is influenced by both compositional and physical parameters. Data from this study allow to update existing partitioning equations for rare earth elements in order to construct a self-consistent model for trachy-phonolitic magmas based on the lattice strain theory. The application of this model to natural products from the Campanian Ignimbrite, the largest caldera-forming eruption at the Campi Flegrei, reveals that the complex rare earth element pattern recorded by the eruptive products can be successfully described by the stepwise fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene and feldspar where the clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficient changes progressively as a function of the physicochemical conditions of the system.},

abstract = {It is now well established that the early continental crust was formed by melting of basaltic lithologies such as amphibolite and eclogite. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the geo- logic environment in which melting took place. Commonly invoked options range between melting at the underside of oceanic plateaus above mantle plumes or melting of oceanic lithosphere during shal- low subduction. Distinguishing between these scenarios has impor- tant implications for the early evolution of continents. We use the fi rst eclogites discovered from the North Atlantic craton (NAC) to con- strain the formation of the deep root to this continent. Late Archean eclogite xenoliths (2.7 ± 0.3 Ga) from a kimberlite in West Greenland are broadly coeval with a major regional episode of tonalite-trond- hjemite-granodiorite (TTG) magmatism. Major and trace element systematics of the eclogites reveal a highly refractory character that is mirrored by NAC peridotites. Moreover, the refractory eclogites defi ne a complementary relationship to the Late Archean TTG gran- itoids from the NAC, and their elevated garnet $\delta$18 O values along with negative Eu anomalies suggest seafl oor-altered oceanic crust as the most viable eclogite protolith. These results from Greenland provide strong support for a model in which early continental crust grew by melting of basaltic slabs in subduction zones, where tectonic stack- ing of down-going oceanic lithosphere provided the mechanism that coupled formation of cratonic crust and mantle.},

abstract = {A variety of high Ba-Sr granites and syenites is intruded into the Caledonian terrane of the Northern Highlands of Scotland. Volumetrically rather small, the plutons display a considerable range of compositions from ultramafic and mafic to granitic and syenitic. Most intrude Proterozoic Moine metasediments, though some are exposed within the Moine Thrust Zone in the west, beyond which lies the Archaean Lewisian foreland. Although it is generally agreed that they are related in some way to the subduction of Iapetus Ocean crust beneath Laurentia, their petrogenesis is much debated, especially the enigmatic relationship between alkaline syenites and calc-alkaline granites. New isotope (Sr-Nd-O) data suggest that both may be derived from mantle sources that include small fractions of subducted pelagic sediment. Juvenile material is volumetrically dominant, although subsequent fractionation involved contamination with local continental crust. Direct derivation from a mafic underplate is unlikely given the absence of pronounced HREE and Y depletion, the major element dissimilarity with adakitic magmas, and the presence of coeval and geochemically-contiguous mantle-derived rocks. The parent magmas were derived from a Caledonian Parental Magma Array (CPMA) that extended from isotopically depleted to significantly enriched compositions, with high $\delta$18O in the latter. The oxygen isotope values and the high Ba-Sr signature in particular strongly suggest that mantle contamination with subducted pelagic carbonates generated the CPMA, and Nd-Sr isotopes constrain the sediment contribution to less than 10{\%}. Differentiation of the parent magmas proceeded by fractional crystallisation and variable concurrent assimilation of small magma batches, involving different crystallising assemblages and different continental reservoirs. Caledonian syenites evolved by extensive pyroxene-dominated fractionation sometimes involving contamination with Lewisian granulites. On the other hand, the granites fractionated amphibole and plagioclase, during which most were contaminated with local Moine metasediment. The extended time interval over which the syenites were intruded (30 Ma) accords with continuing Iapetus subduction beneath the Laurentian margin, while the late pulse of isotopically-variable appinites and granites at about 425 Ma sits comfortably with Scandian slab breakoff. However, the high Ba-Sr granites studied here represent small-volume assimilation-fractionation products of mantle-derived appinitic magmas, rather than the voluminous melts of lamprophyre-underplated crust also predicted by slab breakoff, which are absent from the Northern Highland Terrane. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The [{\~{}}]20 000 km2 Karmutsen Formation flood basalts (Vancouver Island) were emplaced at c. 225-230 Ma onto Middle Triassic marine sediments and Late Devonian to Early Permian island-arc volcanic and sedimentary sequences, and are overlain by Late Triassic platformal carbonates. The basalts form an emergent sequence consisting of a basal sediment-sill complex (600-900 m thick), pillowed and massive submarine flows ({\textgreater}2{\{}middle dot{\}}5 km), pillow breccia and hyaloclastite ({\textless}1{\{}middle dot{\}}5 km), and massive subaerial flows ({\textless}2{\{}middle dot{\}}5 km). Although the Karmutsen Formation is predominantly composed of tholeiitic basalt, the submarine part of the stratigraphy on northern Vancouver Island also contains picritic basalts. These high-MgO (9-20 wt {\%}) lavas are depleted in light rare earth elements (LREE; La/YbCN = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}5 {\{}+/-{\}} 0{\{}middle dot{\}}2), whereas the tholeiitic lavas (6-8 wt {\%} MgO) are LREE-enriched (La/YbCN = 2{\{}middle dot{\}}2 {\{}+/-{\}} 0{\{}middle dot{\}}3).

Major-element modeling results indicate that the picrites formed by extensive melting (23-27{\%}) of anomalously hot mantle ([{\~{}}]1500{\{}degrees{\}}C), which is consistent with a mantle plume initiation model for formation of the Karmutsen flood basalts on Vancouver Island. Trace element constraints indicate that the picrites require melting of a depleted spinel lherzolite source, whereas the tholeiitic basalts involved melting of garnet and spinel lherzolite. The tholeiitic basalts underwent significant fractional crystallization ({\textgreater}50{\%}) and the fractionated residues may be represented by high-velocity rocks beneath Vancouver Island identified from seismic reflection studies.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The Bear Lodge alkaline complex in northeastern Wyoming (USA) is host to potentially economic rare-earth mineralization in carbonatite and carbonatite-related veins and dikes that intrude heterolithic diatreme breccias in the Bull Hill area of the Bear Lodge Mountains. The deposit is zoned and consists of pervasively oxidized material at and near the surface, which passes through a thin transitional zone at a depth of {\~{}}120-183m, and grades into unaltered carbonatites at depths greater than {\~{}}183-190m. Carbonatites in the unoxidized zone consist of coarse and fine-grained calcite that is Sr-, Mn- and inclusion-rich and are characterized by the presence of primary burbankite, early-stage parisite and synchysite with minor bastn{\"{a}}site that have high (La/Nd)cnand (La/Ce)cnvalues. The early minerals are replaced with polycrystalline pseudomorphs consisting of secondary rare-earth fluorocarbonates and ancylite with minor monazite. Different secondary parageneses can be distinguished on the basis of the relative abundances and composition of individual minerals. Variations in key element ratios, such as (La/Nd)cn, and chondrite-normalized profiles of the rare-earth minerals and calcite record multiple stages of hydrothermal deposition involving fluids of different chemistry. A single sample of primary calcite shows mantle-like $\delta$18OV-SMOWand $\delta$13CV-PDBvalues, whereas most other samples are somewhat depleted in13C ($\delta$13CV-PDB≈-8 to -10‰) and show a small positive shift in $\delta$18OV-SMOWdue to degassing and wall-rock interaction. Isotopic re-equilibration is more pronounced in the transitional and oxidized zones; large shifts in $\delta$18OV-SMOW(to {\~{}}18‰) reflect the input of meteoric water during pervasive hydrothermal reworking and supergene oxidation. The textural relations, mineral chemistry and C and O stable-isotopic variations record a polygenetic sequence of rare-earth mineralization in the deposit. With the exception of one Pb-poor sample showing an appreciable positive shift in208Pb/204Pb value ({\~{}}39.2), the Bear Lodge carbonatites are remarkably uniform in their Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic composition:143Nd/144Ndt=0.512591-0.512608; $\epsilon$Ndt=0.2-0.6;87Sr/86Srt=0.704555-0.704639; $\epsilon$Srt=-1.5-2.7;206Pb/204Pbt=18.071-18.320;207Pb/204Pbt=15.543-15.593; and208Pb/204Pbt=38.045-39.165. These isotopic characteristics indicate that the source of the carbonatitic magma was in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and modified by subduction-related metasomatism. Carbonatites are interpreted to be generated from small degrees of partial melt that may have been produced via interaction of upwelling asthenosphere giving a small depleted MORB component, with an EM1 component likely derived from subducted Farallon crust.},

abstract = {The effect of fluorine on the solubilities of Mn-columbite (MnNb2O6), Mn-tantalite (MnTa2O6), zircon (ZrSiO4) and hafnon (HfSiO4) were determined in highly fluxed, water-saturated haplogranitic melts at 800 to 1000 °C and 2000 bars. The melt corresponds to the intersection of the granite minimum with the albite-orthoclase tieline (Ab72Or28) in the quartz-albite-orthoclase system (Q-Ab-Or) due to the addition of P2O5 to the melt. The melt content of P2O5 is 1.7 wt. {\%}, and also contains 1.1 and 2.02 wt. {\%} of Li2O and B2O3, respectively. The composition of the starting glass represents the composition of melts from which rare-elements pegmatites crystallized. Up to 6 wt. {\%} fluorine was added as AgF in order to keep the aluminum saturation index (ASI) of the melt constant. In an additional experiment F was added as AlF3 to make the glass peraluminous. The nominal ASI (molar Al/[Na+K]) of the melts is close to 1 and approximately 1.32 in peraluminous glasses, but if Li considered as an alkali, the ASI of the melts are alkaline (0.85) and subaluminous (1.04), respectively. The solubility products [MnO]*[Nb2O5] and [MnO]*[Ta2O5] are nearly independent of the F content of the melt, approximately 18.19 ± 1.2 and 43.65 ± 2.5 x10-4 KSP (mol2/kg2), respectively. By contrast, there is a positive dependence of zircon and hafnon solubilities on the fluorine content, which increases from 2.03 ± 0.03 x10-4 (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 4.04 ± 0.2 x10-4 (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts with 0 wt. {\%} F to 3.81 ± 0.3 x10-4 (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 6.18 ± 0.04 x10-4 (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts with 8 wt. {\%} F. Comparison of the data from this work and previous studies indicates that ASI of the melt seems to have a stronger effect than the contents of fluxing elements in the melt and the overall conclusion is that fluorine is less important (relative to melt compositions) than previously thought for the control on the behavior of high field strength elements in highly evolved granitic melts. Moreover, this study confirms that although Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf are all high field strength elements, Nb-Ta and Zr-Hf are complexed differently.},

abstract = {The unusually large Meme-Casseus and Bassin assimilation zones surround marble blocks in the 66 m.y.-old, epizonal Terre-Neuve quartz monzonite of northern Haiti. The Meme-Casseus zone, which contains syenodiorite, granodiorite, and minor nepheline syenite, occupies more volume than did the marble block. Therefore, dispersal, as well as addition, of material was required to form the contaminated zones. Mechanisms of addition of material to a magma can include congruent or incongruent melting of wall rock at normal or depressed melting points followed by solution of the melted material, or solution of solid rock by the magma. At the Meme-Casseus zone, minor melting may have occurred, but solution of solid marble was the dominant addition mechanism. Dispersal can take place by diffusion, crystal sinking, or convection, and at Meme-Casseus dispersal was caused largely by convection. The relation of addition to dispersal at the Meme-Casseus assimilation zone suggests that the formation of large assimilation zones is controlled by the mechanism of dispersal of material.},

abstract = {Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands), have undergone several flank and central vent, lava flow and explosive phonolitic eruptions during the last 35 ka, without any apparent structural or petrological control on such a random location of eruption foci. The morphology and size of the volcanic edifices have been changing during that period, but this seems to have not affected the location of new eruptions. In order to investigate what determines the occurrence of either central or flank eruptions at Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, we have performed several numerical experiments considering a wide range of situations in which the main physical conditions (topography, size, depth and shape of the magma chambers, presence of deviatoric stresses, internal structure) of the volcanic system have been changed. The results obtained show that the main control on the pathway that magma will follow to leave the chamber and reach the surface is exerted by the stress field distribution around the chamber, which is a function of the shape of the chamber. This suggests that in the case of Teide-Pico Viejo, where there is not a preferential location for new vents, each new phonolitic eruption is preceded by the modification of the existing magma chamber (or the emplacement of a new batch of magma) that does not necessarily matches the structure of the previous one. The presence of multiple shallow reservoirs containing eruptible magma also influences the stresses distribution around the erupting magma chamber. The numerical results also show that the existence of an extensional stress field plays a significant role in determining the position of the phonolitic feeder dykes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper proposes, on the basis of petrographic and mineralogic data on cutting and cores from two deep wells (“Pantelleria 1” and “Pantelleria 2”), the first model of the active hydrothermal system of the island of Pantelleria. Phyllosilicates were studied in detail because they are considered key minerals in the identification of hydrothermal processes. The results of these studies emphasize differences between the intracaldera and pericaldera areas of the island. Within the 45 ka caldera there is a high-temperature (240–260 °C at 600–800 m depth) active hydrothermal system with five zones of characteristic alteration minerals with increasing depth. Rocks are unaltered to a depth of 200 m, contain smectite and mixed-layer chlorite-smectite (C/S) between 200 and 380 m, chlorite, illite, chalcedony and quartz from 380 to 500 m, albite, adularia and saponite from 500 to 680 m, mixed-layer biotite-vermiculite from 680 m to the depth drilled (1100). Outside the caldera, but near the rim, a low-temperature and low-permeability ({\textless} 140 °C) hydrothermal system is characterized by smectite, dolomite and ankerite at depths of 390 to 650 m, chlorite and calcite at 650–900 m, and mixed layers of chlorite-smectite, illite-smectite and iron carbonates (ankerite, siderite) from 900 m of the well at 1203 m. The superimposition of hydrothermal mineral assemblages is evidence for cooling in the hydrothermal system both inside and outside the caldera. We propose that a high-temperature hydrothermal system developed inside the caldera. In an early stage in the area surrounding the subvolcanic body, biotite isograd is reached and an alkali-metasomatism zone develops inside the body itself. This phase may also account for the development of a chlorite-albite-adularia zone extending to 400 m. A cooling phase (nearly 50 °C) followed, resulting in the substitution of biotite by mixed-layer biotite-vermiculite and by the crystallization of Fe-rich saponite instead of chlorite, within the currently active reservoir. A cooling phase has also been identified in the well outside the caldera.},

abstract = {Relatively homogeneous oxygen isotope compositions of amphibole, clinopyroxene, and olivine separates (+5.2 to +5.7‰ relative to VSMOW) and neodymium isotope compositions ($\epsilon$Nd(T) = −0.9 to −1.8 for primary magmatic minerals and $\epsilon$Nd(T) = −0.1 and −0.5 for mineral separates from late-stage pegmatites and hydrothermal veins) from the alkaline to agpaitic Ilı́maussaq intrusion, South Greenland, indicate a closed system evolution of this igneous complex and support a mantle derivation of the magma.
In contrast to the homogeneous oxygen and neodymium isotopic data, $\delta$D values for hand-picked amphibole separates vary between −92 and −232‰ and are among the most deuterium-depleted values known from igneous amphiboles. The calculated fluid phase coexisting with these amphiboles has a homogeneous oxygen isotopic composition within the normal range of magmatic waters, but extremely heterogeneous and low D/H ratios, implying a decoupling of the oxygen- and hydrogen isotope systems.
Of the several possibilities that can account for such unusually low $\delta$D values in amphiboles (e.g., late-stage hydrothermal exchange with meteoric water, extensive magmatic degassing, contamination with organic matter, and/or effects of Fe-content and pressure on amphibole-water fractionation) the most likely explanation for the range in $\delta$D values is that the amphiboles have been influenced by secondary interaction and reequilibration with D-depleted fluids obtained through late-magmatic oxidation of internally generated CH4 and/or H2. This interpretation is consistent with the known occurrence of abundant magmatic CH4 in the Ilı́maussaq rocks and with previous studies on the isotopic compositions of the rocks and fluids.},

abstract = {{\P}Na–Fe augitic green-core pyroxenes (hereafter called GCPX) are common in the silica-undersaturated basaltic rocks of many magmatic alkaline provinces. In the Cantal massif, green-core pyroxenes occur in nearly all the Supracantalian basalts (9.5 to 2 Ma), in contrast to the Infracantalian basalts (13 to 9.5 Ma) where they are rarely observed. An electron microprobe study demonstrates that the GCPX crystallized from evolved melts at intermediate to high pressures. Both Supra- and Infracantalian basalts show major and trace-element compositions similar to those of Ocean Island Basalts (OIB). However, the Supracantalian basalts exhibit an additional enrichment in Nb and Ta which we ascribe to a metasomatic event in the magma source. This enrichment could be related to the remobilization of metasomatic Ta and Nb-rich oxides located on grain boundaries in mantle peridotites (Bodinier et al., 1996). The hypothesis of the percolation of Si and K-rich metasomatic melts through the mantle is invoked to explain the deposition of these Ta–Nb oxides. On the basis of mineralogical and geochemical arguments, we suggest a relationship between these melts, the timing of the percolation and the formation of GCPX observed in Cantal basalts. We propose that GCPX crystallized in a melt differentiated by “percolative fractional crystallization” (PFC –Harte et al., 1993), a process which would account for the similar major-element composition of the GCPX and pyroxenes observed in the phonolites of the Cantal massif. Amphibolitic siliceous metasomatic veins in peridotite xenoliths recently described by Wulff-Pedersen et al. (1999) contain augites similar in composition to the GCPX in Cantal basalts, in addition to Nb-rich oxides. This confirms the genetic relationship between metasomatic melts, GCPX and Nb-rich oxide parageneses. GCPX would therefore seem to be linked to a metasomatic event which took place both/either during and/or between the two main stages of basaltic outpouring, and is consequently contemporaneous with the volcanism. We suggest that this process may represent a common mechanism in many alkaline provinces, where asthenospheric upwelling generates silicic metasomatizing liquids by PFC. This metasomatic process is inferred to deposit accessory phases within the lithospheric mantle, a process followed by the subsequent inheritance of this metasomatic imprint by the younger basalts.},

abstract = {This experimental study examines the mineral/melt partitioning of Na, Ti, La, Sm, Ho, and Lu among high-Ca clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and silicate melts analogous to varying degrees of peridotite partial melting. Experiments performed at a pressure of 1.5 GPa and temperatures of 1,285 to 1,345 °C produced silicate melts saturated with high-Ca clinopyroxene, plagioclase and/or spinel, and, in one case, orthopyroxene and garnet. Partition coefficients measured in experiments in which clinopyroxene coexists with basaltic melt containing {\~{}}18 to 19 wt{\%} Al2O3 and up to {\~{}}3 wt{\%} Na2O are consistent with those determined experimentally in a majority of the previous studies, with values of {\~{}}0.05 for the light rare earths and of {\~{}}0.70 for the heavy rare earths. The magnitudes of clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients for the rare earth elements correlate with pyroxene composition in these experiments, and relative compatibilities are consistent with the effects of lattice strain energy. Clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients measured in experiments in which the melt contains {\~{}}20 wt{\%} Al2O3 and {\~{}}4 to 8 wt{\%} Na2O are unusually large (e.g., values for Lu of up to 1.33±0.05) and are not consistent with the dependence on pyroxene composition found in previous studies. The magnitudes of the partition coefficients measured in these experiments correlate with the degree of polymerization of the melt, rather than with crystal composition, indicating a significant melt structural influence on trace element partitioning. The ratio of non-bridging oxygens to tetrahedrally coordinated cations (NBO/T) in the melt provides a measure of this effect; melt structure has a significant influence on trace element compatibility only for values of NBO/T less than {\~{}}0.49. This result suggests that when ascending peridotite intersects the solidus at relatively low pressures ({\~{}}1.5 GPa or less), the compatibility of trace elements in the residual solid varies significantly during the initial stages of partial melting in response to the changing liquid composition. It is unlikely that this effect is important at higher pressures due to the increased compatibility of SiO2, Na2O, and Al2O3 in the residual peridotite, and correspondingly larger values of NBO/T for small degree partial melts.},

abstract = {The presence of leucogranitic dikes in orogenic belts suggests that partial melting may be an important process in the lower crust of active orogenies. Low seismic velocity and low electrical resistivity zones have been observed in the lower crust of active mountain belts and have been argued to reflect the presence of partial melt in the deep crust, but volcanoes are rare or absent above many of these inferred melt zones. Understanding whether these low velocity zones are melt-bearing, and if so, why they do not commonly erupt, is essential for understanding the thermal and rheologic structure of the crust and its dynamic evolution. Central to this problem is an understanding of how much melt can be stored before it can escape from the crust via compaction and eventually erupt. Experimental and theoretical studies predict trapped melt fractions anywhere from {\textless}5{\%} to {\textgreater}30{\%}. Here, we examine Mn growth-zoning in peritectic garnets in a Miocene dacite volcano from the ongoing Betic–Rif orogeny in southern Spain to estimate the melt fraction at the time of large-scale melt extraction that subsequently led to eruption. We show that the melt fraction at segregation, corresponding approximately to the critical melt porosity, was ∼30{\%}, implying significant amounts of melt can be stored in the lower crust without draining or erupting. However, seismic velocities in the lower crust beneath active orogenic belts (southern Spain and Tibet) as well as beneath active magmatic zones (e.g., Yellowstone hotspot) correspond to average melt porosities of {\textless}10{\%}, suggesting that melt porosities approaching critical values are short-lived or that high melt porosity regions are localized into heterogeneously distributed sills or dikes, which individually cannot be resolved by seismic studies.},

The crystals grew in the liquid with a rate that did not exceed the diffusion rate of most elements in the liquid. However. Fe3+ seems to have had diffusion rates lower than the crystal growth rate, and this probably caused the development of some sectors enriched in acmite and others enriched in the hedenbergite component. For Al, Ti and Zr a crystal structural control is envisaged although a recent structure-based model for sector zoning fails to explain the efficient separation of these elements into different sectors. Three more occurrences of sector zoned aegirine are noted, all from peralkaline nepheline syenites. The phenomenon is probably more widespread than hitherto realised.},

abstract = {The effects of a strong non-linear thermo-kinetic coupling in the olivine-spinel transition are investigated with a 2D model for fast-subducting slabs. The thermo-kinetic coupling problem is solved in the Lagrangian framework by the differential algebraic method and by using experimental input parameters. Narrow regions with metastable olivine are found in fast and cold slabs down to the 660 km discontinuity, while the thermo-kinetic coupling reduces the depth and width of the zone where olivine and spinel coexist. In contrast to recent kinetic models, both latent heat release and heat diffusion place important constraints on the structure of the metastable wedge. Both processes trigger the ongoing phase transformation in the cold slab interior. A thermal instability over a short timescale (104–105 yr) can occur due to a positive thermo-kinetic feedback. This effect is enhanced at greater depths. The depth of the metastable wedge is found to be extremely sensitive to certain geophysical and thermodynamic parameters such as the lithospheric basal temperature, slab width and the activation energy for diffusion. Variations in these parameters within the experimental uncertainties can cause significant changes in the depth of the metastable wedge. Hence predictions about the exact position of the metastable olivine wedge are rather difficult. We propose that deep focus earthquakes may occur due to a thermal runaway caused by shear heating, while the thermal instability is enhanced by the latent heat release associated with the olivine-spinel phase transition.},

abstract = {Detailed geochemical and field data for the volcanic sequence and intrusions of the Etendeka Igneous Province are used to construct a stratigraphic framework for petrogenetic interpretation of the evolution of the Etendeka-Parana continental flood volcanic event. Geochemical and petrographic characterization of over 1,000 analyzed samples allows 8 mafic and 17 silicic magma types to be recognized. Both silicic and mafic types can be grouped into high-Ti and low-Ti suites on the basis of elevated Ti relative to other elements. The mafic magmas are: Khumib (high-Ti), Tafelberg, Kuidas, Horingbaai, Huab, Tafelkop, Albin, and Esmeralda (all low-Ti). Amongst the silicic types, the Goboboseb, Springbok, Wereldsend, Grootberg, and Beacon low-Ti quartz latites, and the Nil Desperandum high-Ti latite have been described previously. In addition, the Hoas (low-Ti), Nadas, Sechomib, and Hoarusib, (all high-Ti) latites and the Fria (low-Ti), Sarusas, Ventura, Khoraseb, Naude, and Elliott (all high-Ti) quartz latites are described for the first time here. There is a marked provinciality in the distribution of the high- and low-Ti suites, with the former concentrated in the Northern Etendeka region and the latter dominant in the Southern Etendeka. Stratigraphic distribution of magma types allows two new formations to be defined in the Northern Etendeka - the Khumib Formation of basaltic flows and the Skeleton Coast Formation dominated by silicic sheets. The geochemical provinciality hampers precise correlations between Northern and Southern Etendeka. Available evidence suggests that the lower part of the Awahab Formation in the Southern Etendeka is coeval with the lower part of the Khumib Formation and that the silicic units in the upper part of the Tafelberg Formation probably correlate with the Skeleton Coast Formation. The paucity of Khumib dykes in relation to Tafelberg dykes and their field relationships with regard to the volcanic sequence in the Northern Etendeka suggests that the main Khumib eruptive centers lay further north, consistent with southward thinning of the Khumib basalts. In the Southern Etendeka, the Doros complex is the eruptive center of the plume-derived Tafelkop basalts, which probably built a shield volcano within the regional flood lava field. This work indicates that the Etendeka has a greater variety of both silicic and low-Ti mafic magma types than are known from the SE Parana. Detailed comparisons reveal that all the important silicic types in the Parana have geochemical equivalents in the Etendeka. New correlations are Santa Maria=Fria, Ourinhos=Khoraseb, Guarapuava=Sarusas, thus extending the previously recognized correlations between Southern Etendeka quartz latites and the Caixas do Sul and Anita Garibaldi "rhyolites." These correlations emphasize that very large volume silicic systems develop with pronounced lithospheric rifting in continental flood basalt provinces.},

abstract = {Plate tectonics on Earth is driven by the subduction and stirring of dense oceanic lithosphere into the underlying mantle. For such a regime to exist on any planet, stresses associated with mantle convection must exceed the strength of the lithosphere. This condition is sufficiently restrictive that plate tectonics currently operates only on Earth, and mantle convection in most terrestrial planets and moons is probably in a stagnant lid regime. Convective stresses on the lithosphere depend on the viscosity and velocity of underlying cold downwellings. The lithospheric yield stress is controlled by its friction coefficient and elastic thickness (the depth to the brittle-ductile transition or BDT). Both convective stresses and the plate's yield strength depend critically on the size, thermal state and cooling history of a planet. Accordingly, here we use numerical simulations and scaling theory to identify conditions in which mantle convection leads to lithospheric failure for a range of conditions relevant to the terrestrial planets. Whereas Earth is expected to be in a plate-tectonic regime over its full thermal evolution, the Moon and Mercury are expected to have always remained in a stagnant lid regime. Venus, Io and Europa currently fall on the transition between the two regimes, which is consistent with an episodic style of mantle convection for Venus, a tectonic component to deformation on Io, and the resurfacing history and lithospheric evolution of Europa. Our results suggest that Venus may have been in a plate-tectonic regime in the past. While stagnant now, it is plausible that Mars may have also been in an active-lid regime, depending on whether there was liquid water on the surface. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {Using a data bank containing over 325 major-element analyses of biotite minerals from many localities around the world, it is demonstrated that biotite compositions depend largely upon the nature of magmas from which they have crystallized. Host rocks of the biotite minerals used include alkaline anorogenic (A-type) suites, calc-alkaline orogenic suites, and peraluminous (including S-type) suites. Biotite minerals representing these three magmatic rock groups define three compositionally distinct fields; biotites in anorogenic alkaline suites (field A) are mostly iron-rich, siliceous biotites (near annite), with an average FeO */MgO ratio of 7.04; those in peraluminous (including S-type) suites (field P) are siderophyllitic in composition and have an average FeO */MgO ratio of 3.48; whereas biotites in calc-alkaline orogenic suites (field C) are moderately enriched in Mg, with an average FeO */MgO ratio of 1.76. It should be noted that the average FeO */MgO ratio in biotite doubles from calc-alkaline through peraluminous to alkaline suites (FeO * = total Fe). Iron enrichment in biotites in the alkaline system occurs at the expense of both Mg and Al via two substitution schemes; Mg⇆Fe, and 2AI⇆3Fe 2+. The latter substitution, however, does not play a sigificant role during the crystallization of biotites in calc-alkaline or peraluminous magmas, as Fe shows little variation with Al in biotites in both systems. In those two systems, the substitution 3Mg⇆2Al is vital; it produces siderophyllitic compositions in peraluminous rocks. The contrasting behaviour of Fe and Mg with respect to Al during the crystallization of biotite minerals is governed, in part, by the various physicochemical conditions including the behaviour of volatiles in these orogenic vs. anorogenic magma systems. The distinct biotite compositions obtained in fields A, P, and C for the various magmatic rock groups can be shown to have a theoretical basis. Furthermore, the discriminant boundaries that define these fields have a statistical basis. Statistical linear discriminant function analysis of the data on a three-group basis (A, P, and C) correctly classifies 89-95{\%} of these biotite minerals. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that the compositions of igneous biotites clearly reflect the nature of their host magmas. {\textcopyright} 1994 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {The Las Canadas caldera in Tenerife (Canary Islands) is a well-exposed caldera depression in which the active Teide-Pico Viejo complex stands. In addition to its volcanological interest, the Las Canadas caldera also holds the main groundwater reservoir of Tenerife. An audiomagnetotelluric and magnetotelluric survey was carried out in order to image the interior of the caldera depression. The field campaign consisted of 33 audiomagnetotelluric sites in the period range from 0.001 to 0.3 s and 11 magnetotelluric sites from 0.004 to 200 s. A detailed mapping of the electrical conductivity of the subsurface was obtained. For the long periods a three-dimensional modelling of the island - including the bathymetry - was carried out to study the effect of the ocean. This effect starts to be important at periods longer than 10 s. Accordingly, the sites were arranged into six profiles and a two-dimensional joint inversion of all data until 10 s was performed for each profile. The geometry of the high conductive zones found indicates that the caldera includes two closed depressions in the western (Ucanca) and central (Guajara) sectors, whereas in the eastern sector (Diego Hern{\'{a}}ndez) the top of the main conductive zone shows a gentle inclination towards the northeast (La Orotava valley). A narrow and marked high conductive anomaly, probably caused by the presence of highly fractured rocks and fossil hydrothermal alteration along a fracture zone, runs parallel and close to the present caldera wall, suggesting the position of the structural border of the caldera. The results indicate that there are two main aquifer zones separated by the Roques de Garc{\'{i}}a spur, coinciding with the western and central depressions. The eastern depression could be hydrologically disconnected from the central depression by another structural limit not visible at the surface. The saturation zones would have a thickness of more than 700 m starting at a few hundred metres below the present caldera floor. The data are consistent with a multiple vertical collapse origin for the caldera depression rather than a sector collapse origin. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Variations in Pb, C and O isotopic data from ferrocarbonatites are attributed to fluid activity that is probaby related to formation of associated massive fluorite deposits, known to be of low-temperature hydrothermal origin. In contrast, the high abundances of Nd (average 1191 ppm) and Sr (average 4261 ppm) from the calciocarbonatites, which buffer their initial Nd and Sr isotopic ratios against crustal contamination, and their "mantle-like" C and O isotopic ratios suggest that their isotopic ratios are probably inherited from their mantle source. The initial Nd and Sr isotopic ratios from the Amba Dongar calciocarbonatites indicate derivation from a Rb/Sr- and Nd/Sm-enriched mantle source quite different to most young ( {\textless} 200 Ma) carbonatites which have signatures that lie between HIMU and EM I mantle components. The isotopic ratios from the Amba Dongar calciocarbonatites are similar to proximal alkaline complexes of similar age and the least contaminated Deccan flood basalts. We propose, therefore, that the R{\'{e}}union hot spot responsible for the Deccan flood basalts may have had some bearing on producing the parental melt that generated the Amba Dongar carbonatite. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {New SHRIMP U-Pb zircon and titaniie data are presented for two amphibolites from the Central Zone of the Damara Orogen, Namibia. These data (the first ages for amphibolites in the Central Zone) show that amphibolites are derived from both Palaeoproterozoic (2026.9 ± 2.3 Ma-sample ACAM-1) and Pan-African (557.2 ± 7.4 Ma-sample LKR021) precursors emplaced into the Palaeoproterozoic Abbabis Complex basement in the Central Zone. The younger amphibolites are interpreted as part of a mafic to dioritic phase of magmatism in the Central Zone (the Goas Suite), and major-And trace-element geochemistry from a suite of amphibolites from the southwestern Central Zone confirms this relationship. This phase of mafic to dioritic magmatism is contemporaneous with the onset of collision between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons. It is suggested that delamination of dense mafic lower cnist and underplating of mantle-derived magmas following crustal thickening may have led to partial melting of pre-Pan-African mafic lower crust, generating this mafic to dioritic suite of rocks. Metamorphic zircon overgrowths in sample LKR021 give an age of 520 ± 6.9 Ma, consistent with recent estimates for the age of peak metamorphism in the southwestern Central Zone. Titanites from LKR021 give an age of 493.4 ± 6.4 Ma, and this is interpreted as a cooling age for the Central Zone.},

abstract = {Recent phase equilibria studies, and the concepts of basic magma evolution to which they have given rise, are reviewed. The variations with pressure of liquid compositions in equilibrium with peridotite are summarised, and their bearing on the origins of peridotite nodules in basalt and upon upper mantle mineralogy are discussed. The origin of observed concentrations of the elements K, Ti, P from source rocks containing only very low concentrations of these elements is readily explained by ca. 15{\%} partial melting combined with variable eclogite fractionation and up to 50{\%} further extraction of olivine, yielding optional concentration factors from 8 to 70. Orthopyroxene fractionation cannot explain these effects. There is no to 50{\%} further extraction of olivine, yielding optional concentration factors of from 8–70. Orthopyroxene fractionation cannot explain these effects. There is no need for wall-rock reaction hypotheses which are difficult to envisage operating throughout the long history of a particular volcano. A revised closed system model of basalt magma evolution is presented, based upon these controlling factors; depth of partial melting, extent of partial melting, speed of movement towards the surface. The source rock of basic magmas at depths greater than ca. 60 km is probably a garnet-two pyroxenes-peridotite (garnet-lherzolite), which on partial melting yields and garnet-enstatite-peridotite (garnet-harzburgite), not two pyroxenes-peridotite (lherzolite) residua. The pyroxenite stage of basalt evolution, like the eclogite stage, is located at temperatures below the garnet- or spinel-lherzolite solidus and only affects slow moving magma batches. Six hypotheses for the origin of the calc-alkali series are reviewed. The fractionation of water-enriched high-alumina basalt at relatively high partial pressures of oxygen is concluded to be the mechanism in best accord with available facts. Fig.4–11 and their captions contain material and arguments not duplicated in the text. The figures, together with the conclusions section summarise the main themes of this paper.},

abstract = {We report the Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions (1) of 66 lava flows and dikes spanning the circa 15 Myr subaerial volcanic history of Gran Canaria and (2) of five Miocene through Cretaceous sediment samples from DSDP site 397, located 100 km south of Gran Canaria. The isotope ratios of the Gran Canaria samples vary for87Sr86Sr: 0.70302-0.70346, for143Nd144Nd: 0.51275-0.51298, and for206Pb204Pb: 18.76-20.01. The Miocene and the Pliocene-Recent volcanics form distinct trends on isotope correlation diagrams. The most SiO2-undersaturated volcanics from each group have the least radiogenic Sr and most radiogenic Pb, whereas evolved volcanics from each group have the most radiogenic Sr and least radiogenic Pb. In the Pliocene-Recent group, the most undersaturated basalts also have the most radiogenic Nd, and the evolved volcanics have the least radiogenic Nd. The most SiO2-saturated basalts have intermediate compositions within each age group. Although the two age groups have overlapping Sr and Nd isotope ratios, the Pliocene-Recent volcanics have less radiogenic Pb than the Miocene volcanics. At least four components are required to explain the isotope systematics of Gran Canaria by mixing. There is no evidence for crustal contamination in any of the volcanics. The most undersaturated Miocene volcanics fall within the field for the two youngest and westernmost Canary Islands in all isotope correlation diagrams and thus appear to have the most plume-like (high238U204Pb) HIMU-like composition. During the Pliocene-Recent epochs, the plume was located to the west of Gran Canaria. The isotopic composition of the most undersaturated Pliocene-Recent volcanics may reflect entrainment of asthenospheric material (with a depleted mantle (DM)-like composition), as plume material was transported through the upper asthenosphere to the base of the lithosphere beneath Gran Canaria. The shift in isotopic composition with increasing SiO2-saturation in the basalts and degree of differentiation for all volcanics is interpreted to reflect assimilation of enriched mantle (EM1 and EM2) (cf. [1]) in the lithosphere beneath Gran Canaria. This enriched mantle may have been derived from the continental lithospheric mantle beneath the West African Craton by thermal erosion or delamination during rifting of Pangaea. This study suggests that the enriched mantle components (EM1 and EM2) may be stored in the shallow mantle, whereas the HIMU component may have a deeper origin. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Chromite was equilibrated with two natural basic liquids and one natural ultrabasic liquid at temperatures and oxygen fugacities appropriate to geological conditions. The experiments were designed to document changes in mineral and glass compositions between the iron-w{\"{u}}stite and nickel-nickel oxide buffers, with special emphasis on conditions along quartz-fayalite-magnetite. The Cr contents of the melts at chromite saturation increase strongly with increasing temperature and with decreasing oxygen fugacity. A relationship is described which accounts for the compositional dependence of the partitioning of Cr between spinels and silicate melts by considering the exchange of FeCr2O4 component between the crystalline and melt phases. Interpretation of the data in terms of this exchange suggests that Cr3+ in metaluminous melts occurs in octahedrally coordinated sites, and that it does not depend on charge-balancing by monovalent cations. In this model, Cr3+ is proposed to behave like network-modifying Al3+ and Fe3+, i.e., the excess aluminum and ferric iron which do not participate in tetrahedrally coordinated matrix or network-forming complexes. The results can also be applied to the problem of the formation of massive chromitites of great lateral extent in basic layered intrusions. The data are consistent with a model in which the crystallization of chromite is initiated through magma mixing, in combination with the rapid heat loss associated with periodic influxes of magma into a chamber. An alternative model, in which chromite crystallization is initiated by repeated fluctuations in oxygen fugacity, is possible only if the magma fO2 is not controlled by an oxygen buffer such as QFM.},

abstract = {The Pilanesberg Complex (South Africa) is one of the world's largest but least studied alkaline complexes. It consists of trachytes, phonolites, syenites and nepheline syenites (foyaites) and the preservation of the volcanic carapace makes it unique among the larger alkaline complexes. The intrusive history of the Pilanesberg Complex shows similarities to the Greenland Kangerlussuaq Intrusion, and our new whole-rock major and trace element analyses, combined with existing data, show that the complex belongs to the Sr-rich type of evolved alkaline rocks, more similar to the complexes of the Kola Peninsula than Il{\'{i}}maussaq. Despite the absence of mafic lithologies, comparison with experimental studies shows that the parental magma was most likely an alkali basalt. Significant iron enrichment is caused by an early stage of fractionation involving clinopyroxene and amphibole rather than olivine and plagioclase, reflecting water-rich compositions and intermediate levels of oxygen fugacity. This fractionation trend has led to strong enrichment in Sr and Ba, but only moderate levels of Y and middle to heavy rare earth elements, and minimal Eu-anomaly. Late-stage water-rich fluids caused significant autometasomatism in most units. New U-Pb dating of titanite constrains the age of the Pilanesberg Complex as 1395 + 10/− 11 Ma. Initial87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios around 0.7028 ($\epsilon$Sr1395= − 1) are typical for a moderately depleted mantle source, unlike the local lithospheric mantle. The combination of an enriched trace-element signature and depleted isotopic characteristics is evidence for small degrees of partial melting. Epsilon Sr values are similar to those reported for other alkaline complexes worldwide, emplaced in crust with contrasting geological histories; this likely reflects lithospheric metasomatism shortly before magmatism and minimal crustal contamination.},

abstract = {Strongly peralkaline volcanic complexes tend to be shieldlike due to coalescence of low-viscosity lavas from numerous vent areas and blanketing by pyroclastic flows and falls. Dense welding and rheomorphism commonly mask the nature of pyroclastic units; welded pumice falls are common. Relatively low eruptive columns produce poorly sorted pumice falls that are difficult to distinguish from topography mantling pyroclastic flows. Welded fall deposits are characterized by multiple, fine-scale, welding reversals, welding zones that correspond with stratification, and by flattening of fiamme parallel to underlying slopes, whereas welded topography-mantling ignimbrites may have fine-grained basal layers, lithic lenses, imbricate fiamme, and variations in crystal content and fiamme size with topographic position. Calderas are relatively small, typically 3–9 km in diameter, with little evidence for single-stage subsidence in excess of a few hundred meters. Many strongly peralkaline volcanic centers show evidence of two or more nested calderas, and partial reactivation of older ring fractures is common. Replenishment of magma reservoirs beneath calderas can promote dilatant reactivation of older subsidence structures, resulting in multicyclic collapses that reuse these structures. In several centers, the caldera-forming unit is zoned from pantellerite to more crystal-rich trachyte. Following collapse, trachyte lavas commonly erupt from a central vent on the caldera floor, building a cone that nearly fills the caldera. Reestablishment of isostatic equilibrium may be accomplished both by eruption of these lavas and by flow of trachytic and more-mafic magma into the root zone beneath the volcano. Resurgent doming sensu strictu has not been documented in strongly peralkaline systems; at Pantelleria and Mount Suswa, however, the central portions of the cauldron blocks were uplifted and tilted. Magma reservoirs that feed explosive eruptions generally are shallow, as indicated by pyroclastic units that contain lithic fragments of the volcanic edifice (commonly including cognate syenite) but lack subjacent crustal lithologies. In addition, the overwhelming predominance of alkali feldspar as a phenocryst phase and the scarcity of quartz are consistent with pantellerite liquidus relations only at pressures {\textless}100 MPa. Pantellerite and trachyte shields may represent the mature stage of continental rift volcanism; once the flux of mantle-derived magmas has been sufficient to generate a large mass of felsic liquid that can act as a density filter, mafic magmas rarely reach the surface.},

abstract = {The Central Plateau Member rhyolites have been erupted between 173 and 70 ka and are the youngest Yellowstone intracaldera rhyolites. They mostly comprise very voluminous lava flows totaling {\~{}}600 km3 in volume. Their eruptive vents define two NNW-trending lineaments which are aligned with regional faults. We present new whole rock, glass, and mineral analyses and propose a petrogenetic and volcano-tectonic model for these rhyolites. At a caldera-wide scale, there is a temporal enrichment in elements such as Nb, Y and HREE, and a depletion in Sr, Ba, and Ce/Yb. Simultaneously, clinopyroxene becomes less magnesian while Ti contents in quartz decrease. By contrast, quartz in all rhyolites is rounded and bears long glass re-entrants, suggesting heating. Based on these data and observations, we propose that the Central Plateau Member rhyolites have been generated as follows. A hydrothermally altered low-$\delta$18O rhyolitic protolith beneath the Mallard Lake Resurgent Dome in the southwestern part of the caldera started to melt at {\~{}}250 ka. Repeated heating pulses caused the melting front to expand radially, and a large crystal mush formed beneath much of the caldera. The mush was able to differentiate but not erupt due to its high crystallinity and viscosity. Further inputs of heat and silicic magma in this mush increased the degree of melting, forming crystal-poor magma batches which erupted a few hundred to a few thousand years later through regional faults to form the Central Plateau Member rhyolites.},

abstract = {Abundances of precious metals and cobalt in the lithospheric mantle are typically obtained by bulk geochemical analyses of mantle xenoliths. These elements are strongly chalcophile and the mineralogy, texture and trace element composition of sulphide phases in such samples must be considered. In this study we assess the mineralogy, textures and trace element compositions of sulphides in spinel lherzolites from four Scottish lithospheric terranes, which provide an ideal testing ground to examine the variability of sulphides and their precious metal endowments according to terrane age and geodynamic environment. Specifically we test differences in sulphide composition from Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic cratonic sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) in northern terranes vs. Palaeozoic lithospheric mantle in southern terranes, as divided by the Great Glen Fault (GGF).Cobalt is consistently elevated in sulphides from Palaeozoic terranes (south of the GGF) with Co concentrations. {\textgreater}. 2.9. wt.{\%} and Co/Ni ratios. {\textgreater}. 0.048 (chondrite). In contrast, sulphides from Archaean cratonic terranes (north of the GGF) have low abundances of Co ({\textless}. 3600. ppm) and low Co/Ni ratios ({\textless}. 0.030). The causes for Co enrichment remain unclear, but we highlight that globally significant Co mineralisation is associated with ophiolites (e.g., Bou Azzer, Morocco and Outokumpu, Finland) or in oceanic peridotite-floored settings at slow-spreading ridges. Thus we suggest an oceanic affinity for the Co enrichment in the southern terranes of Scotland, likely directly related to the subduction of Co-enriched oceanic crust during the Caledonian Orogeny. Further, we identify a distinction between Pt/Pd ratio across the GGF, such that sulphides in the cratonic SCLM have Pt/Pd. ≥. chondrite whilst Palaeozoic sulphides have Pt/Pd. {\textless}. chondrite. We observe that Pt-rich sulphides with discrete Pt-minerals (e.g., PtS) are associated with carbonate and phosphates in two xenolith suites north of the GGF. This three-way immiscibility (carbonate-sulphide-phosphate) indicates carbonatitic metasomatism is responsible for Pt-enrichment in this (marginal) cratonic setting. These Co and Pt-enrichments may fundamentally reflect the geodynamic setting of cratonic vs. non-cratonic lithospheric terranes and offer potential tools to facilitate geochemical mapping of the lithospheric mantle.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a simple theoretical model to explain two of the most important observations about trace element partitioning. The first of these is the apparent dependence of crystal–melt partition coefficients on charge such that when a cation such as Ca2+ is replaced by ions of approximately the same radius but different charge, partitioning follows the approximate relationship: D2+Ca{\textgreater}Di3+≈Dj1+{\textgreater}Dk4+≥Dn0+ where n refers to a noble gas atom. The second observation is the strong correlation between partition coefficients for highly charged ions and the bulk composition of the crystal, e.g. the correlation between DTh and Al content of clinopyroxene. Starting from the substitution of an ion of charge Zc into a site which normally accommodates a major ion of different charge Zo, we find, using a simplified continuum model [Born, Z. Phys. 1 (1920) 45–48] that the electrostatic work of substitution should depend on (Zc−Zo)2. Observed partitioning between melt and the clinopyroxene M2 site for ions of similar radius to Ca2+ follows an approximately parabolic dependence on cation charge, implying that electrostatic work is a major influence on partitioning behaviour. From the form of the parabola we derive an electrostatic energy of substitution $\Delta$Gelec in clinopyroxene M2 of approximately 28 kJ mol−1. One implication is that, if noble gases enter lattice sites in minerals, they should have broadly similar crystal–melt partition coefficients to U and Th. In any given natural pyroxene, with random mixing of major ions on each sublattice, the ‘best-fit' charge at the M2 site depends on the composition of the local environment. From the bulk crystal composition we can compute the proportions of M2 sites which, for local electroneutrality, should contain 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ or 0+ ions. By summing the proportions of the different configurations and weighting them according to their relative electrostatic energies, the effects of crystal composition on trace element partitioning can be predicted. The model predicts that the clinopyroxene–melt partition coefficients of rare earth elements (REE3+) should increase by a factor of 2.3 as the Al content of tetrahedral sites (Aliv) increases from 0.001 to 0.3. For more highly charged cations the effect is more dramatic, the partition coefficient for Th4+ being predicted to increase by a factor of 300 over the same composition range. In both cases the predictions agree well with experimental observations. When the effects of pressure are combined with those of composition we find that noble gas partition coefficients should increase with pressure relative to those of U and Th and plausibly become larger than the latter. We conclude that the electrostatic work of substitution exerts a large and predictable influence on the partitioning behaviour of trace cations. Together with lattice strain energy, it should be explicitly accounted for in the development of thermodynamic descriptions of partitioning behaviour.},

abstract = {Super-eruptions are extremely rare events. Indeed, the global frequency of explosive volcanic eruptions is inversely proportional to the volume of magma released in a single event. The rate of magma supply, mechanical properties of the crust and magma, and tectonic regime are known to play a role in controlling eruption frequency and magnitude, but their relative contributions have not been quantified. Here we use a thermomechanical numerical model of magma injection into Earth's crust and Monte Carlo simulations to explore the factors controlling the recurrence rates of eruptions of different magnitudes. We find that the rate of magma supply to the upper crust controls the volume of a single eruption. The time interval between magma injections into the subvolcanic reservoir, at a constant magma-supply rate, determines the duration of the magmatic activity that precedes eruptions. Our simulations reproduce the observed relationship between eruption volume and magma chamber residence times and replicate the observed correlation between erupted volumes and caldera dimensions. We also find that magma buoyancy is key to triggering super-eruptions, whereas pressurization associated with magma injection is responsible for relatively small and frequent eruptions. Our findings help improve our ability to decipher the long-term activity patterns of volcanic systems.},

In conjunction with previously published whole rock measurements from Noril'sk, our sulfur isotopic data indicate that crustal contamination was widespread and heterogeneous-though not universal-during the emplacement of the Siberian Traps.

abstract = {Partition coefficients (Min/LD) for a series of geochemically relevant elements have been calculated from combined EMP/LA-ICP-HRMS analyses of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, Ti-magnetite, biotite, apatite, and trachytic/trachyphonolitic melt pairs in selected Campi Flegrei rocks. Pl/LD and Kfs/LD values are generally very low for most of the trace-elements but Sr, Ba, and Eu. Kfs/LD for the latter elements record a systematic increase as the melt composition changes from trachyte to trachyphonolite, likely due to increasing structural compliance of the sanidine in the trachyphonolites related to larger Na/K values. Conversely, Kfs/LD values for transitional, highly charged incompatible elements (e.g., LREE) decrease from trachyte to trachyphonolite, possibly in response to the decrease of melt polymerization. Min/LD values for titanomagnetite generally decrease with the increasing melt evolution, the highest values being those measured for Ti, V, and Sc. Ti, Ba, Sc, Rb, Nb, Ta, and V are compatible in biotite in equilibrium with trachytic melt, whereas Cs, Sr, and Pb are incompatible and REE are strongly incompatible, as supported by the extremely low Bt/LDY (0.003-0.008). Partition coefficients for apatite and trachyphonolitic glass pairs are high for Sr, REE (particularly MREE), and Y, large for Th, U, and V, generally low for HFSE, and variable for other LILE. The comparison of measured Min/LD values for Campi Flegrei trachytes/trachyphonolites with other sets of partition coefficients reported in literature for evolved systems suggests that a reliable data set for magma evolution modeling requires: (1) a thorough preliminary selection of natural samples; (2) the adoption of accurate microanalytical techniques; (3) the direct measurement of Min/LD values for each specific melt composition.},

This suggests that the large diamonds grew from liquid metal in Earth's mantle. The inclusions also provide direct evidence of a long-suspected metal precipitation reaction that requires a more reducing mantle. Science, this issue p. 1403 The redox state of Earth's convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.

abstract = {. Volume diffusion rates for five rare earth elements (La, Ce, Nd, Dy, and Yb) have been measured in single crystals of natural diopside at pressures of 0.1 MPa to 2.5 GPa and temperatures of 1,050 to1,450 °C. Polished, pre-annealed crystals were coated with a thin film of rare earth element oxides, then held at constant temperature and pressure for times ranging from 20 to 882 h. Diffusion profiles in quenched samples were measured by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) depth profiling. At 1 atm pressure, with the oxygen fugacity controlled near the quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer, the following Arrhenius relations were obtained for diffusion normal to (001) (diffusion coefficient D in m2/s): log10 D Yb =(–4.64±0.42)–(411±12 kJ/mol/2.303RT); log10 D Dy =(–3.31±1.44)–(461±41 kJ/mol/2.303RT); log10 D Nd =(–2.95±2.64)–(496±77 kJ/mol/2.303RT); log10 D Ce =(–4.10±1.08)–(463±31 kJ/mol/2.303RT); log10 D Lu =(–4.22±2.66)–(466±78 kJ/mol/2.303RT). Diffusion rates decrease significantly with increasing ionic radius, with La a factor of {\~{}}35 slower than Yb. The relationship between diffusivity and ionic radius is consistent with a model in which elastic strain plays a critical role in governing the motion of an ion through the crystal lattice. Activation volumes for Yb and Ce diffusion, at constant temperature and oxygen fugacity, are 9.0±2.0 cm3/mol and 8.9±3.2 cm3/mol, respectively, corresponding to an order of magnitude decrease in diffusivity as pressure is increased from 0 to 3 GPa at 1,200 °C. Diffusion of Nd is such that grain-scale isotopic equilibrium in the mantle can be achieved in {\~{}}1 My under conditions near the peridotite solidus ({\~{}}1,450 °C at 2.5 GPa). The equilibration time is much longer under P, T conditions of the lithospheric mantle or at the eclogite solidus ({\~{}}1 Gy at 1.5 GPa and 1,150 °C). Because of the relatively strong decrease in diffusivity with pressure (two orders of magnitude between 2.5 and 15 GPa along an adiabatic temperature gradient), Nd transport in clinopyroxene will be effectively frozen at pressures approaching the transition zone, on time scales less than 100 My. Rare earth element diffusion rates are slow enough that significant disequilibrium uptake of REE by growing clinopyroxene phenocrysts may be preserved under natural conditions of basalt crystallization. The relative abundances and spatial distributions of REE in such crystals may provide a sensitive record of the cooling and crystallization history of the host lava.},

abstract = {In this experimental study, we examine the mineral-melt partitioning of major and trace elements between clinopyroxene and CO2-rich kimberlitic melts at a pressure of 6 GPa and temperatures of 1410??C and 1430??C. The melts produced contain ??? 28 wt{\%} dissolved CO2, and are saturated with olivine and clinopyroxene. To assess the effects of temperature, crystal and melt compositions on trace element partitioning, experiments were performed in the model CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2 system. Our results reveal that all the elements studied, except Al, Mg, Si, and Ga, are incompatible in clinopyroxene. Partition coefficients show a considerable range in magnitude, from ??? 10-3 for DU and DBa to ??? 2.5 for DSi. The two experimental runs show similar overall partitioning patterns with the D values being lower at 1430??C. Rare earth elements display a wide range of partition coefficients, DLa (0.012-0.026) being approximately one order of magnitude lower than DLu (0.18-0.23). Partition coefficients for the 2+ and 3+ cations entering the M2-site exhibit a near-parabolic dependence on radius of the incorporated cations as predicted from the lattice strain model. This underlines the contribution made by the crystal structure toward controlling the distribution of trace elements. Using data obtained in this study combined with that in the published literature, we also discuss the effects that other important parameters, namely, melt composition, pressure, and temperature, could have on partitioning. Our partition coefficients have been used to model the generation of the Group I (GI) kimberlites from South Africa. The numerical modeling shows that kimberlitic melts can be produced by ???0.5{\%} melting of a MORB-type depleted source that has been enriched by small-degree melts originating from a similar depleted source. This result suggests that the source of GI kimberlites may be located at the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition. Percolation of small degree melts from the asthenosphere would essentially create a metasomatic horizon near the bottom of the non-convecting sublithospheric mantle. Accumulation of such small degree melts together with the presence of volatiles and conductive heating would trigger melting of the ambient mantle and subsequently lead to eruption of kimberlitic melts. Additionally, our model shows that the GI source can be generated by metasomatism of a 2 Ga old MORB source ca. 1 Ga ago. Assuming that MORB-type mantle is the most depleted source of magmas on earth, then this is the oldest age at which the GI source could have existed. However, this age most likely reflects the average age of a series of metasomatic events than that of a single event. Copyright ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recently, a new model for mantle convection was proposed that may be more realistic than previous standard models. Exciting questions remain, of course, but we believe it can be used to reconcile otherwise conflicting evidence from different research fields and thus provide a new framework for further studies of convection.Drawing on some of our own recent work [Albar{\`{e}}de, 1998] and that of others we further explore the model proposed by Kellogg et al. [1999] and Van der Hilst and Karason [1999]. The new view considers that a deep layer, chemically distinct from the overlying layers, occupies roughly the lower third of the mantle. Such a deep layer would host a substantial fraction of the terrestrial heat producing elements and help close the budget of some critical isotopic systems.The subtle trade-off between chemical and thermal density variations produces significant dynamic topography, which complicates its seismic detection but facilitates downwelling slabs to pierce through it. Thermal plumes would form at the transition between the boundary layer and the overlying part of the convective mantle. Severing the tie between the depleted and less depleted and outgassed reservoirs and the seismologically identified upper and lower mantle, separated by the 660-km discontinuity, seems to go a long way toward reconciling the otherwise conflicting pieces of evidence.},

abstract = {We present a method for the efficient separation of Sr from geological materials followed by high-precision measurement of Sr isotopes by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). These analyses focus on high-precision measurements of the low abundance isotope84Sr (0.56{\%}), which is of high interest for cosmochemical applications. The robust dataset obtained through the analysis of a range of basalts and anorthosites sheds light on a number of issues regarding Sr isotopic analyses. Specifically, concerns that analytical artefacts may produce a spurious signal on84Sr have been investigated. The external reproducibility, based on replicate measurements of the basalt standard BCR-2, for $\epsilon$84Sr is ±0.36 (2SD), and is ±0.51 (2SD) for repeated analyses of NIST SRM-987. In contrast with the static measurements of previous work (Andreasen and Sharma, 2007; Moynier et al., 2012; Paton et al., 2013; Brennecka et al., 2013), our dynamic data reveal no84Sr variations in terrestrial rocks or standard material. The dataset indicates that, by the analytical procedure employed,84Sr variations in extra-terrestrial material larger than {\~{}}0.5$\epsilon$ are resolvable.},

abstract = {Garnet is the most commonly used mineral in thermobarometry, whereas zircon is the most robust chronometer to date high-grade metamorphic rocks. To provide a basis for correlation of zircon and garnet growth, we determined experimentally the trace element partitioning between zircon, a hydrous granitic melt and garnet at 20??kbar and 800-1000????C for P, Y, rare earth elements (REE), Zr, Hf, Th and U. In respect to melt, zircon preferentially incorporates all investigated elements apart from REE with atomic number lower than Sm. At this pressure and in the chosen composition, the distribution coefficient between zircon and melt (DZrn/Melt) for REE increases with increasing atomic number of the REE and with decreasing temperature. DYbZrn/Melt is ??? 20 at 1000????C, but more than an order of magnitude higher at 800????C. The solubility of Zr in hydrous granitic melts buffered by zircon is about a factor of two lower at 20??kbar than what has been previously established for mid-crustal pressures. Large garnet produced in the experiments allowed determination of garnet/melt trace element partitioning (DGrt/Melt) at temperatures of 800-1000????C, conditions relevant for partial melting of crustal rocks. There is a systematic increase in DREEGrt/Melt with decreasing temperature. Zircon contains significantly more heavy-REE than garnet at temperatures of 800-850????C. Zircon/garnet partition coefficients of heavy-REE decrease with increasing temperature from DLuZrn/Melt of 12 at 800????C to 1.4 at 1000????C. Middle-REE partitioning is close to unity for the whole investigated temperature range. Different empirically determined zircon/garnet partition coefficients from granulites and ultra-high temperature granulites can potentially be explained by the experimentally determined change of partitioning as a function of temperature. These data can assist in establishing equilibrium between garnet and zircon zones in natural rocks, and in the construction of detailed pressure-temperature-time paths in high-grade metamorphic rocks. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Continental intraplate volcanoes, such as Erebus volcano, Antarctica, are associated with extensional tectonics, mantle upwelling and high heat flow. Typically, erupted magmas are alkaline and rich in volatiles (especially CO2), inherited from low degrees of partial melting of mantle sources. We examine the degassing of the magmatic system at Erebus volcano using melt inclusion data and high temporal resolution open-path Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements of gas emissions from the active lava lake. Remarkably different gas signatures are associated with passive and explosive gas emissions, representative of volatile contents and redox conditions that reveal contrasting shallow and deep degassing sources. We show that this unexpected degassing signature provides a unique probe for magma differentiation and transfer of CO2-rich oxidised fluids from the mantle to the surface, and evaluate how these processes operate in time and space. Extensive crystallisation driven by CO2 fluxing is responsible for isobaric fractionation of parental basanite magmas close to their source depth. Magma deeper than 4{\&}{\#}xa0;kbar equilibrates under vapour-buffered conditions. At shallower depths, CO2-rich fluids accumulate and are then released either via convection-driven, open-system gas loss or as closed-system slugs that ascend and result in Strombolian eruptions in the lava lake. The open-system gases have a reduced state (below the QFM buffer) whereas the closed-system gases preserve their deep oxidised signatures (close to the NNO buffer).},

abstract = {The Henties Bay-Outjo dyke swarm (HOD) in NW Namibia presents a well-exposed example of the magma feeder system for continental flood basalts. This study uses bulk-rock, mineral and melt inclusion compositions from dyke samples to define pressure-temperature crystallization conditions and thus contributes to the understanding of the magma plumbing and storage beneath the province. The thermobarometry calculations for near-equilibrium mineral-melt pairs (the latter proxied by whole-rock) indicate olivine crystallization at {\~{}}. 1170 to 1350. °C and lower, overlapping, temperatures for clinopyroxene and plagioclase ({\~{}}. 1070 to 1210. °C) in keeping with the order of crystallization inferred from petrographic observation. The dykes yielding the highest temperatures ({\textgreater}. 1300. °C) are in a specific region of the HOD near the litho-tectonic boundary of the Neoproterozoic Kaoko and Damara Belts, where magma permeability of the crust may have been enhanced.Pressure estimates from clinopyroxene-melt pairs range from 0 to 10. kbar overall (13 dykes) indicating polybaric crystallization. The lowest pressures are recorded by clinopyroxene oikocrysts intergrown with plagioclase, which likely represent the dyke emplacement depths. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts and plagioclase-free oikocryst cores yield a higher range of crystallization pressures at 4-6. kbar, corresponding to mid-crustal depths of 11-17. km. There is no spatial pattern in the pressure variations, suggesting a rather uniform level of magma stagnation and crystallization in all areas of the HOD. Partial crystallization at intermediate depths is consistent with the inference of entrained crystals and with geochemical evidence for crystal accumulation in some of the dykes. Comparison of model magma densities and the crustal density derived from seismic velocity profiles suggest the dyke magmas had positive buoyancy in the lower- and middle crust and near-neutral buoyancy in the upper crust. The depth of magma stagnation or pooling at 11-17. km depth may relate to this or to the brittle-ductile transition in the felsic Damara crust. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Melting relations at 5 and 20 kbar on the composition join sanidine-potassium carbonate are dominated by a two-liquid region that covers over 60{\%} of the join at 1,300 ° C. At this temperature, the silicate melt contains approximately 19 wt{\%} carbonate component at 5 kbar and 32 wt{\%} carbonate component at 20 kbar. The conjugate carbonate melt contains less than 5 wt{\%} silicate component, and it varies less as a function of temperature than does the silicate melt. Partition coefficients for Ce, Sm, and Tm between the immiscible carbonate and silicate melts at 1,200 ° and 1,300 ° C at 5 and 20 kbar are in favor of the carbonate melt by a factor of 2–3 for light REE and 5–8 for heavy REE. The effect of pressure on partitioning cannot be evaluated independently because of complementary changes in melt compositions. Minimum REE partition coefficients for CO2 vapor/carbonate melt and CO2 vapor/silicate melt can be calculated from the carbonate melt/silicate melt partition coefficients, the known proportions of melt, and maximum estimates of the proportion of CO2 vapor. The vapor phase is enriched in light REE relative to both melts at 20 kbar and enriched in all REE, especially the light elements, at 5 kbar. The enrichment of REE in CO2 vapor relative to both melts is 3–4 orders of magnitude in excess of that in water vapor (Mysen, 1979) at 5 kbar and is approximately the same as that in water vapor at 20 kbar. Mantle metasomatism by a CO2-rich vapor enriched in light REE, occurring as a precursor to magma genesis, may explain the enhanced REE contents and light REE enrichment of carbonatites, alkali-rich silicate melts, and kimberlites. Light REE enrichment in fenites and the granular suite of nodules from kimberlites attests to the mobility of REE in CO2-rich fluids under both mantle and crustal conditions.},

abstract = {Most studies of compositional heterogeneities in the mantle, related to recycling of crustal sediments or delaminated subcontinental lithosphere, come from oceanic setting basalts. In this work, we present direct geochronological and geochemical evidence for the incorporation of recycled crustal materials in collision-related carbonatites of the South Qinling orogenic belt (SQ), which merges with the Lesser Qinling orogen (LQ) to separate the South and North China Blocks. The SQ carbonatites occur mainly as stock associated with syenites. The data presented here show that zircon from the syenites yields an age of 766±25Ma, which differs significantly from the age of primary monazite from the carbonatites (233.6±1.7Ma). The syenites contain lower initial87Sr/86Sr and higher $\epsilon$Ndvalues. This indicates that the carbonatites do not have genetically related with the silicate rocks, and were directly derived from a primary carbonate magma generated in the mantle. The carbonatites show a Sr-Nd isotopic signature similar to that of the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR), and parallel Sm-Nd model ages (TCHUR) of 190-300Ma. However, the rocks have extremely variable Pb isotopic values straddling between the HIMU and EM1 mantle end-members. Most carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the SQ carbonatites plot outside the field for primary igneous carbonates. Their $\delta$13C shows higher value than a 'normal' mantle, which implies an incorporation of recycled inorganic carbon. The carbonatites were emplaced close to the Mianlue suture, and followed the closure of the Mianlue ocean and Triassic collision of the South and North China Blocks. However, direct melting of the subducted Mianlue oceanic crust characterized by high $\epsilon$Ndand low (EM1-like)206Pb/204Pb values cannot explain the CHUR-like Nd signature and the Pb isotopic trend toward HIMU in the SQ carbonatites. We conclude that their parental magma was derived from a source incorporating the Mianlue oceanic crust mixed with an asthenospheric (or deeper) material characterized by high Pb and low Nd isotopic values. This material represents a deep-seated Proterozoic carbonate component recycled via mantle convection or localized upwelling. Notably, this model cannot explain the isotopic compositions of the Late Triassic (209-221Ma) carbonatites in the LQ, characterized by a mantle-derived $\delta$13C, but EM1-like Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions. This signature is best explained in terms of delamination of the lower continental crust thickened during the collision of the South and North China Blocks, and partial incorporation of the delaminated material into the LQ mantle source. Modeling of the measured Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic variations suggests that the source of the LQ carbonatites could be produced by mixing of 80-85{\%} of mantle material and 15-20{\%} of delaminated lower continental crust. The emplacement of the SQ and LQ carbonatites marked a gradual transition from a compressional tectonic regime, brought about by the collision of the South and North China Blocks to intra-orogenic extension in the waning stages of the Triassic orogeny.},

abstract = {Large-scale, catastrophic mass wasting is a major process contributing to the dismantling of oceanic intraplate volcanoes. Recent studies, however, have highlighted a possible feedback relationship between flank collapse, or incipient instability, and subsequent episodes of structural rearrangement and/or renewed volcano growth. The Teno massif, located in northwestern Tenerife (Canary Islands), is a deeply eroded Miocene shield volcano that was built in four major eruptive phases punctuated by two lateral collapses, each removing {\textgreater}20–25 km3 of the volcano's north flank. In this paper, we use detailed field observations and petrological and geochemical data to evaluate possible links between large-scale landslides and subsequent volcanism/magmatism during Teno's evolution. Inspection of key stratigraphic sequences reveals that steep angular unconformities, relics of paleolandslide scars, are marked by polymict breccias. Near their base, these deposits typically include abundant juvenile pyroclastic material, otherwise scarce in the region. While some of Teno's most evolved, low-density magmas were produced just before flank collapses, early postlandslide lava sequences are characterized by anomalously high proportions of dense ankaramite flows, extremely rich in clinopyroxene and olivine crystals. A detailed sampling profile shows transitions from low-Mg {\#} lavas relatively rich in SiO2 to lavas with low silica content and comparatively high Mg {\#} after both landslides. Long-term variations in Zr/Nb, normative nepheline, and La/Lu are coupled but do not show a systematic correlation with stratigraphic boundaries. We propose that whereas loading of the growing precollapse volcano promoted magma stagnation and differentiation, the successive giant landslides modified the shallow volcano-tectonic stress field at Teno, resulting in widespread pyroclastic eruptions and shallow magma reservoir drainage. This rapid unloading of several tens of km3 of near-surface rocks appears to have upset magma differentiation processes, while facilitating the remobilization and tapping of denser ankaramite magmas that were stored in the uppermost mantle. Degrees of mantle melting coincidently reached a maximum in the short time interval between the two landslides and declined shortly after, probably reflecting intrinsic plume processes rather than a collapse-induced influence on mantle melting. Our study of Teno volcano bears implications for other oceanic volcanoes where short-term compositional variations may also directly relate to major flank collapse events.},

abstract = {The Main Ethiopian Rift hosts a number of peralkaline volcanic centres, several of which show signs of recent unrest. Due to the low number of historical eruptions recorded in the region and lack of volcanic monitoring, conditions of magma storage in the Main Ethiopian Rift remain poorly constrained. Aluto is one of these restless volcanic centres and identifying magma storage conditions is vital for evaluating the significance of recent periods of unrest. Using Aluto as a case study, we explore magma storage conditions using Rhyolite-MELTS thermodynamic modelling software. We performed {\~{}} 150 fractional crystallisation models using a primitive basalt as the starting composition, and for a range of pressures (50–300 MPa), initial H2O contents (0.5–3 wt{\%}) and oxygen fugacities (QFM − 2–QFM + 1). Predicted liquid lines of descent from these models are compared with published whole-rock data and, together with new observations of natural phase assemblages and erupted mineral compositions, provide constraints on magma storage conditions. Using a statistical approach to compare empirical data and thermodynamic model outputs, we find that compositions of evolved peralkaline rhyolites from Aluto are best reproduced by protracted (90{\%}) isobaric fractional crystallisation from a rift-related basaltic composition, without the need for significant crustal assimilation. The required extent of fractional crystallisation suggests that much of the magmatic system may exist as a highly crystalline mush with only a small lens of rhyolitic melt. The best agreement between models and natural samples is at low pressures (150 MPa), low initial H2O concentrations (0.5 wt{\%}) and an oxygen fugacity near the QFM buffer. The depth of magma storage derived from these results ({\~{}} 5.6 ± 1 km) is consistent with the source depths modelled from measured ground deformation. Data from other peralkaline volcanic centres in the Main Ethiopian Rift (Boset and Gedemsa), and other locations globally (e.g. Pantelleria, Italy) suggest that these storage conditions are a common feature of many peralkaline volcanic centres.},

abstract = {The Barry gold deposit is an example of an Archean greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit located in the Urban-Barry greenstone belt in the Abitibi subprovince of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. The host mafic volcanic rocks are part of the 2717 Ma Macho Formation of the Northern Volcanic zone. They are cut by a series of weakly foliated preore diorite, pre- and postore quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP), and quartz monzonite dikes and plugs, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the age of the gold mineralization. Auriferous zones are spatially associated with northeast-trending ductile shear zones with moderate south-easterly dip. Gold mineralization occurs within straight N64° E/64° SE and folded N20° E/60° SE, on average, albite-carbonate-quartz veins and within the surrounding carbonate-quartz-pyrite, and locally within biotite-carbonate alteration zones of the host mafic volcanic rocks. The auriferous veins comprise 5 to 15 vol percent of the mafic volcanic rocks, are 1 to 5 cm wide, and are locally boudinaged. Although the volcanic units strike N55–60° E and dip 40° SE, the ore envelope ({\textgreater}2 g/t Au) is constrained from surface to a depth of 30 m in an antiformal shape. Gold generally occurs as microinclusions in pyrite but is also present as free gold in albite-carbonate-quartz veins, synmineralization altered host rocks, and locally within quartz veins cutting early QFP dikes. The deposit has an indicated resource of 309,500 oz Au (7,701,000 t at 1.25 g/t Au) and an inferred gold resource of 471,950 oz Au (10,411,000 t at 1.41 g/t Au). U-Pb dating of single zircon grains from the premineralization diorite and postmineralization QFP yielded indistinguishable ages, averaging 2697 ± 0.6 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of gold mineralization at the Barry deposit. This age and the field relationships reveal that lode gold mineralization was coeval with regional deformation and magmatism, similar to that documented at the Kiena, Norlartic, and Siscoe (Main zone) deposits of the Val d'Or district. These deposits represent the earlier orogenic gold event in the Abitibi greenstone belt, which preceded the postmagmatic, quartz-tourmaline auriferous veins such as those present at Sigma. Barry, Kiena, Norlartic, and Siscoe share many similarities with other orogenic gold deposits worldwide that are spatially associated with felsic and intermediate intrusions. The genesis for these deposits is not well constrained, as it is not obvious to distinguish whether the auriferous fluids were derived from the coeval magmas or whether both magmas and fluids were derived from a thermal event from the deep crust, or possibly the mantle.},

abstract = {A suite of intrusive carbonate rocks, some containing xenoliths of nepheline syenite and Durness Group dolomite, has been discovered near the shore of Loch Urigill, Assynt, Scotland, c. 400 m outside the contact of the strongly alkaline Loch Borralan intrusion. Four varieties occur: porphyritic white sovite, phlogopite sovite, sovite breccia and foliated silicocarbonatite. Initially only the white sovite was found in situ, intrusive into Durness dolomites, but excavation has revealed all types, except the silicocarbonatite, in place. The rocks are largely Sr-rich calcite, often enclosing phlogopite poikilitically, together with fluorapatite rosettes. Fluorite, titanite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and ilmenite also occur. Diopside, potassic richterite and chondrodite are found in the silicocarbonatite and in the vicinity of xenoliths of silicate-rock and dolomite in the other carbonatite types. The carbonate rocks have the high Sr, Rb and Ba, rare earth element patterns, and carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios characteristic of carbonatites from a mantle source region and are chemically distinct from the Durness dolomites, even when the latter are sampled as xenoliths in nepheline syenite. Although the absence of Nb and the lack of significant fenitization of accompanying silicate rocks are somewhat uncharacteristic, we conclude that the rocks at Loch Urigill are true carbonatites related to the Loch Borralan complex. The strongly alkaline Loch Borralan intrusion and its associated carbonatite represent the most westerly expression of Caledonian magmatism in Britain, which supports the view that they represent the products of small-scale partial melting in old, cold lithospheric mantle on the flanks of the orogen.

abstract = {himu, em i andem ii are three of the main geochemical mantle components that give rise to oceanic island basalts [1]. They represent the end members that produce the extreme isotopic compositions measured on intraplate volcanics. In French Polynesia, all three mantle components are represented in volcanic rocks. The characteristichimu signature is found in Tubuai, Mangaia and Rurutu,em i is present in the source of Rarotonga and Pitcairn volcanics andem ii dominates the composition of most Society Islands. Intermediate values between the three end members are found on most islands. We suggest that the three components are not independent but are physically related in the mantle. Thehimu component is thought to be recycled oceanic crust that lost part of its Pb through hydrothermal processes prior to and during subduction.em i andem ii are believed to acquire their isotopic and trace element characteristics through entrainment of sediments that were subducted together with the oceanic crust. The trace element pattern and the isotopic composition ofhimu lavas can be quantitatively modelled using a mixture of ∼ 25{\%} old recycledmorb crust and 75{\%} mantle peridotite. The extreme Pb composition is modelled assuming that Pb was lost from oceanic crust when hydrothermal alteration at the ridge leached Pb from the basalt to redeposit it as sulphides on top of and throughout the crust, followed by preferential dissolution of sulphides during dehydration in the subduction zone. These processes led to a drastic increase of theU/Pb ratio of the subducted material which evolved over 2 Ga to very radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions. Pb isotopic compositions similar to those ofem i andem ii are modelled assuming that sediments with average crustal Pb isotopic compositions were subducted and recycled into the mantle together with the underlyingmorb oceanic crust. Pelagic sediments ($\mu$ ∼ 5 and$\kappa$ ∼ 6) account for the Pb isotopic composition ofem i whereas terrigenous sediments ($\mu$ ∼ 10 and$\kappa$ ∼ 4.5) evolve towards theem ii end member. A few percent of sediment in the recycled crust-sediment mixture will destroy the characteristic Pb isotopic signature of thehimu component. This, together with the low probability of isolating oceanic crust in the mantle for ⩾ 2 Ga, explains why the extremehimu composition, as seen on Tubuai and St Helena, is sampled so rarely by oceanic volcanism.},

abstract = {An analysis of the global array of ocean island volcanics shows that carbonatites only form in those hotspots that have the lowest Si- and highest alkali-contents among their primi- tive melts, such as the Cape Verde and Canary (Islands) hotspots. Fractionated melts from these two hotspots reach, at any given SiO2 , several wt{\%} higher total alkali contents than for ocean islands without carbonatites. This is because their strongly silica-undersaturated primitive melts fractionate at low SiO2 to high alkali contents, driving the evolving melt into the silicate-carbonatite miscibility gap. Instead, moderately alkaline magmas fraction- ate toward the alkali-feldspar thermal divide and do not reach liquid immiscibility. Low SiO2 and high alkalis are the combined result of comparatively deep and low-degree mantle melting, the latter is corroborated by the highest high-field-strength and rare earth element concentrations in the Cape Verde and Canary primitive melts. CO2 in the source facilitates low melt SiO2 , but enrichment in CO2 relative to other hotspots is not required. The oceanic hotspots with carbonatites are among those with the thickest thermal lithosphere supporting a deep origin of their asthenospheric parent melts, an argument that could be expanded to continental hotspot settings.},

abstract = {Carbonatites and alkaline-silicate rocks are the most important sources of rare earth elements (REE) and niobium (Nb), both of which are metals imperative to technological advancement and associated with high risks of supply interruption. Cooling and crystallizing carbonatitic and alkaline melts expel multiple pulses of alkali-rich aqueous fluids which metasomatize the surrounding country rocks, forming fenites during a process called fenitization. These alkalis and volatiles are original constituents of the magma that are not recorded in the carbonatite rock, and therefore fenites should not be dismissed during the description of a carbonatite system. This paper reviews the existing literature, focusing on 17 worldwide carbonatite complexes whose attributes are used to discuss the main features and processes of fenitization. Although many attempts have been made in the literature to categorize and name fenites, it is recommended that the IUGS metamorphic nomenclature be used to describe predominant mineralogy and textures. Complexing anions greatly enhance the solubility of REE and Nb in these fenitizing fluids, mobilizing them into the surrounding country rock, and precipitating REE- and Nb-enriched micro-mineral assemblages. As such, fenites have significant potential to be used as an exploration tool to find mineralized intrusions in a similar way alteration patterns are used in other ore systems, such as porphyry copper deposits. Strong trends have been identified between the presence of more complex veining textures, mineralogy and brecciation in fenites with intermediate stage Nb-enriched and later stage REE-enriched magmas. However, compiling this evidence has also highlighted large gaps in the literature relating to fenitization. These need to be addressed before fenite can be used as a comprehensive and effective exploration tool.},

abstract = {We report methane-dominant hydrocarbon (fluid) inclusions (CH4±C2H6–C2H2, C3H8) coexisting with primary brine inclusions and secondary halide melt (solid NaCl) inclusions in Au–Pt-rich quartz-sulfide-epidote alteration veins associated with the footwall-style Cu–PGE (platinum-group element)–Au deposits at the Fraser Mine (North Range of the Sudbury Igneous Complex). Evidence for coentrapment of immiscible hydrocarbon–brine, and hydrocarbon–halide melt mixtures is demonstrated. A primary CH4–brine assemblage was trapped during quartz growth at relatively low T (min. T trapping∼145–315°C) and P (max. P trapping∼500 bar), prior to the crystallization of sulfide minerals in the veins. Secondary inclusions contain solid halite and a mixture of CH4, C2H6–C2H2 and C3H8 and were trapped at a minimum T of ∼710°C. The halite inclusions may represent halide melt that exsolved from crystallizing sulfide ores that texturally postdate (by replacement) early alteration quartz hosting the primary, lower T brine–CH4 assemblage. Laser ablation ICP-MS analyses show that the brine, hydrocarbon and halide melt inclusions contain significant concentrations of Cu (0.1–1 wt{\%} range), Au, Bi, Ag and Pt (all 0.1–10 ppm range). Cu:Pt and Cu:Au ratios in the inclusions are significantly (up to 4 log units) lower than in the host alteration veins and adjacent massive sulfide ore veins, suggesting either (1) early Cu loss from the volatiles by chalcopyrite precipitation or (2) enhanced Au and Pt solubilities relative to Cu at the temperatures of entrapment. Concentration ratios between coexisting brine and CH4 inclusions [Celembrine/CelemCH4][C{\^{}}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$rm elem{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$rm brine{\}}{\}}/C{\^{}}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$rm elem{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$rm CH{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\}}] are lower for Cu, Au, Bi and Ag than for other elements (Na, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb) indicating that during interaction with the brine, the hydrocarbon phase was enriched in ore metals. The high concentrations of ore metals in hydrocarbon, brine and halide melt phases confirm that both aqueous and non-aqueous volatiles were carriers of precious metals in the Sudbury environment over a wide range of temperatures. Volatile evolution and magmatic sulfide differentiation were clearly part of a single, continuous process in the Sudbury footwall. The exsolution of H2O-poor volatiles from fractionated sulfide liquid may have been a principal mechanism controlling the final distribution of PGE and Au in the footwall ore systems. The study reports the first measurements of precious metal concentrations in fluid inclusions from a magmatic Ni–Cu–PGE environment (the Sudbury district).},

abstract = {The Kalahari Craton was initially stabilized following cessation of Palaeoproterozoic orogenesis in southern Africa at ca. 1.8 Ga. Subsequent Mesoproterozoic intraplate magmatism at ca. 1.4-1.35 Ga formed a series of alkaline and carbonatitic complexes in the southern part of the craton. Original volcanic structures are partly preserved in some of the complexes, and a variety of intrusive rocks (e.g., quartz syenite, nepheline syenite, pyroxenite, ijolite, carbonatite) are present. The Premier kimberlite cluster was emplaced in the same region at ca. 1.2 Ga, but available geochronology indicates that the main alkaline magmatism preceded 1.2-1.0 Ga orogenesis in the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt along the southern craton margin. Another, more extensive intraplate magmatic event at ca. 1.1 Ga formed the Umkondo Igneous Province, which is recognized over an area of ∼2.0 × 106km2on the Kalahari Craton, including a detached fragment now located in Antarctica. Much of the province comprises high-level mafic intrusions, but erosional remnants of basalt lava piles and bimodal basalt/rhyolite assemblages are also present. Most of the mafic rocks are continental tholeiites, but trace-element geochemistry reveals distinct subgroups that cannot be related by crustal-level assimilation/fractional crystallization processes or by partial melting of a uniform mantle source. Geochronological and palaeomagnetic data indicate that enormous volumes of tholeiitic magma were emplaced within the province in a narrow time frame at ca. 1112-1106 Ma, which is inferred to record uprise of a mantle plume behind the Namaqua-Natal-Maud Belt. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a brief synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the formation and break-up of the early-Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia, and the subsequent assembly of Gondwanaland. Our discussions are based on both palaeomagnetic constraints and on geological correlations of basement provinces, orogenic histories, sedimentary provenance, the development of continental rifts and passive margins, and the record of mantle plume events. Rodinia assembled through worldwide orogenic events between 1300 Ma and 900 Ma, with all, or virtually all, continental blocks known to exist at that time likely being involved. In our preferred Rodinia model, the assembly process features the accretion or collision of continental blocks around the margin of Laurentia. Like the supercontinent Pangaea, Rodinia lasted about 150 million years after complete assembly. Mantle avalanches, caused by the sinking of stagnated slabs accumulated at the mantle transition zone surrounding the supercontinent, plus thermal insulation by the supercontinent, led to the formation of a mantle superswell (or superplume) beneath Rodinia 40–60 million years after the completion of its assembly. As a result, widespread continental rifting occurred between ca. 825 Ma and 740 Ma, with episodic plume events at ca. 825 Ma, ca. 780 Ma and ca. 750 Ma. Like its assembly, the break-up of Rodinia occurred diachronously. The first major break-up event occurred along the western margin of Laurentia (present coordinates), possibly as early as 750 Ma. Rifting between the Amazonia craton and the southeastern margin of Laurentia started at approximately the same time, but only led to break-up after ca. 600 Ma. By this time most of the western Gondwanan continents had joined together, although the formation of Gondwanaland was not complete until ca. 530 Ma.},

abstract = {We present detailed experimental results on the partitioning of rare earth elements (REE) between titanite and a range of different silicate melts. Our results show that Henry's law of trace element partitioning depends on bulk composition, the available partners for heterovalent substitution, crystal composition, and melt composition. We illustrate that the partition coefficients for Sm depend very strongly on the bulk concentration of Sm in the system. The substitution mechanism, by which rare earth elements are incorporated into the crystal structure, plays an important role for trace element partitioning and also for the onset of Henry's law. Our data show that there are clear differences between substitution mechanisms of major elements compared to elements which are present only as traces. Our experiments also clearly show that the onset of Henry's law depends on the concentrations of the sum of all trace elements which are incorporated into the crystal by the same substitution mechanism. For geochemical modelling of magmatic processes involving titanite, and indeed other accessory phases, it is of crucial importance to first evaluate whether the REE, and other trace elements, are present as traces or as major elements, only then appropriate D values may be chosen. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the Marvejols area (Southern french Massif Central), the gneissic Marvejols supergroup is overthrust on the metasedimentary “S{\'{e}}rie du Lot”, deposited in part prior to 540 Ma. The allochtonous terranes are characterized by the occurrence of a leptyno-amphibolitic group, a complex association of mafic and felsic rocks of igneous and sedimentary derivation. A 480±10 Ma age has been obtained by U-Pb dating of zircons, for the crystallization of both mafic and felsic meta-igneous rocks. These rocks were emplaced during an important extensional tectonics. Relics of eclogites, pyrigarnites, coronite gabbros and HP-trondhjemites are clear evidence for a further HP-HT event dated at 415±6 Ma on zircons from a HP trondhjemite. Subsequently, the Marvejols supergroup underwent an amphibolite facies metamorphism with incipient mobilization dated at 345±10 Ma. Rifting and thinning of the continental crust in Cambro-Ordovician times appears to be a major geodynamic feature which could account for the thermal events often referred to the “Caledonian” orogeny. The Silurian (415 Ma) age of the HP episode is clearly older than the main Variscan tectonometamorphic event; it is in agreement with Rb-Sr dating of the Moldanubian granulites and with some radiometric data from Southern Brittany (France). These results point to a compressive phase, probably in a subduction context, in view of the high pressures reached (15–20 Kb), after the Cambro-Ordovician distensive phase. The main final tectono-metamorphic paroxysm (blocking of subduction process and continental collison ?) is not prior to the end of Devonian (340–350 Ma) and is related to the Variscan orogeny s.s},

abstract = {We present studies on the physical volcanology of the ∼15 Ma Roza Member of the Wanapum Formation in the Columbia River Basalt Group. The Roza Member represents a compound pahoehoe flood basalt lava flow field, with an area of ∼40,300 km2 and a volume of ∼1300 km3. It consists of 4 major lava flows each composed of numerous, decimeter to kilometer long pahoehoe lobes. Roza lavas feature a wide range of pahoehoe surface structures, such as lava rise plateaus, tumuli, and surface breakouts, and we illustrate that the lava morphology is inconsistent with previous proposals of rapid emplacement for these lavas. An integral component of the Roza flow field is the sheet lobe with internal structures identical to those of inflated pahoehoe sheet lobes from Hawaii and Iceland, both at the same scale and at much larger scales. We identify a three-part division of the sheet lobes into basal crust, lava core, and lava crust, which are interpreted as the equivalent to the bottom crust, the liquid lava core, and the surface crust of an active inflating pahoehoe lobe. The upper lava crust grows continuously during lava emplacement and its growth rate can be approximated by conductive cooling. This relationship is used to calculate the emplacement time for individual Roza sheet lobes and to derive a first-order estimate on the duration of the Roza eruption. The results indicate that the emplacement of individual Roza lobes lasted for months to years and that the lava flow field was constructed over a period of at least 14 years. We propose that the Roza flows achieved great areal dimensions and thicknesses by inflation and endogenous growth. As the lava flowed from vent to flow front it traveled under an insulating crust which maintained cooling rates of {\textless}0.1 °C/km and allowed for efficient transport of lava over distances up to 300 km.},

abstract = {Synthetic samples with different chemical compositions along the hedenbergite–aegirine (CaFe2+Si2O6–NaFe3+Si2O6) solid-solution series have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and 57Fe M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy. All compounds show C2/c symmetry, both at 298 K and at low temperature (100 K). The structural changes within the hedenbergite–aegirine series are dominated by the M1 site while the M2 site plays a minor role. Replacement of Fe2+ by Fe3+ increases the polyhedral distortion of the M1 site and causes an increased repulsion between neighboring M1 sites. The changes in M1-site geometry also induce distinct alterations within the kinking state of the tetrahedral chains, but the changes in tetrahedral bond lengths and angles are small. In addition to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments, a large number of synthetic samples were investigated by 57Fe M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy at 298 K and, for three selected compositions, between 80 and 700 K. Here, substantial line broadening of the Fe2+ resonance absorption was observed as an aegirine component is substituted. Two different groups of local distortion environments were observed for Fe2+ within the solid-solution series, which change relative proportions and numeric value of the quadrupole splitting as a function of chemistry and temperature. This line broadening cannot be ascribed to discrete next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) configurations of Ca and Na as has been done in the literature. Above {\~{}}250 K, additional resonance absorption appears in the spectra of samples with aegirine components between 20 and 75 mol{\%}. This absorption gains intensity with increasing temperature, while the 57Fe hyperfine parameters approach values intermediate between Fe2+ and Fe3+. This effect is ascribed to fast electron delocalization between Fe2+ and Fe3+ at elevated temperature.},

abstract = {Melt viscosity affects virtually all aspects of igneous petrogenesis. Although addition of H2O is known to lower melt viscosities, addition of fluorine is controversial and may raise them. Because these two volatiles most commonly reach their highest concentrations in granitic rocks, the viscosities of peralkaline, strongly peraluminous, and weakly peraluminous granitic melts with approximately 1.5 wt{\%} F and 6 wt{\%} H2O were measured to investigate the combined effects of H2O and F on granitic melt viscosities when those volatiles are present at natural concentration levels. Viscosities were measured between 800 and 1000° C at 1.0 GPa with the falling sphere technique in a piston-cylinder apparatus. Viscosities of all melts studied behave in an Arrhenius manner and can be described by the following equations: Peralkaline $\eta$ = 2.70 ± 0.21 × 10 − 6 exp ⁡ ( 181.9 ± 1.0 / RT ) Metalminous $\eta$ = 4.54 ± 0.44 × 10 − 7 exp ⁡ ( 213.8 ± 1.0 / RT ) Peraluminous $\eta$ = 2.60 ± 0.25 × 10 − 8 exp ⁡ ( 242.8 ± 1.0 / RT ) where viscosity is in units of Pa s and the activation energy is in kJ/mol;R is the gas constant, in J mol−1 K−1, andT is temperature in Kelvin. Uncertainties are 1 standard errors based upon estimated uncertainties, ±5 relative {\%}, in the viscosity measurements. Viscosities of these melts with high volatile contents can be well estimated with existing viscosity models. Viscosities of the peraluminous melts studied are similar to those of hydrous granitic melts containing water concentrations equal to the total of H2O + F in the melts studied. All volatile-bearing per- and metaluminous granitic melts display a rapid (6 to 7 orders of magnitude) drop in viscosity with the first 3 wt{\%} volatiles added followed by only an additional factor of two decrease in viscosity as the volatile concentration is increased from 3 to 12 wt{\%}. The peralkaline melt displays viscosities significantly below those of all other volatile-bearing, per- and metaluminous melts previously studied. The lower viscosities of peralkaline granitic melts allow them to separate more rapidly from their source regions, be transported through conduits at a velocity approximately an order of magnitude faster, and experience more efficient crystallization-fractionation than per- and metaluminous granitic melts.},

abstract = {South Greenland has been the site of historic mining of cryolite, copper, graphite and gold, hosts mineral deposits with gold, uranium, zinc, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, hafnium, REE, iron, titanium, vanadium, fluorite and graphite, and has additional potential for lithium, beryllium, phosphorus, gallium and thorium. Data from stream sediment geochemical surveys document that South Greenland is enriched in a range of these elements relative to the rest of Greenland and to estimates of the upper crust composition. Distribution patterns for individual elements within south Greenland exhibit enriched regions that are spatially related to lithological units, crustal structure and known mineralisation. The Northern Domain of South Greenland includes the southernmost part of the orthogneiss-dominated North Atlantic craton. Orogenic gold mineralisation is hosted by quartz veins and hydrothermally altered rocks associated with shear zones intersecting the Mesoarchaean Tartoq Group of mafic metavolcanic rocks. Geochemical exploration indicates that additional potential for gold mineralisation exists within Palaeoproterozoic supracrustal rocks overlying the Archaean basement. Rocks formed during the Palaeoproterozoic Ketilidian orogeny occupy a major part of South Greenland and has been divided into two domains. The Central Domain is underlain by the Julianeh{\aa}b igneous complex forming a 100 km wide ENE-WSW zone centrally across South Greenland. Intrusive and extrusive, mostly felsic magmatic rocks were emplaced in two main stages (1850-1830 and 1800-1780 Ma) in a continental arc setting. Positive anomalies in aeromagnetic data indicate that mafic plutons are common in the late igneous complex. Intra-arc mafic metavolcanic rocks contain syngenetic stratabound copper sulphide and epigenetic shear zone-hosted copper-silver-gold mineralisation at Kobberminebugt and Kangerluluk, whereas metasedimentary and metapyroclastic rocks contain stratabound uraninite mineralisation. Orthomagmatic iron-titanium-vanadium mineralisation is hosted by a gabbro. A potential for porphyry-type mineralisation related to the late intrusive stages of the Julianeh{\aa}b igneous complex is suggested by showings with copper, molybdenum and gold together with stream sediment anomalies for these elements. Vein-type uranium mineralisation occurs in fault zones in the Julianeh{\aa}b igneous complex related to Mesoproterozoic rifting. The Southern Domain contains an assemblage of Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks that underwent moderate to strong deformation, peak HT-LP metamorphism and partial melting with subsequent retrograde exhumation at 1790-1765 Ma. The supracrustal rocks contain syngenetic Au, As, Sb, U, and Zn mineralisation in volcanic or graphite- and sulphide-rich sedimentary environments; graphite was mined historically at two sites. Many stream sediment gold anomalies are located in a NE-trending belt along the boundary between the early Julianeh{\aa}b complex and the supracrustal rocks to the south. They reflect a number of auriferous quartz vein occurrences, including the Nalunaq gold deposit, hosted in a system of shear zones and probably generated as orogenic gold during Ketilidian accretion. The 1755-1730 Ma, A-type Ilua plutonic suite is the latest magmatic event in the Ketilidian orogen. The 1300-1140 Ma Gardar period involved continental rifting, sedimentation and alkaline magmatism. Numerous dykes and 10 ring-shaped intrusion complexes were formed across South Greenland. An orthomagmatic iron-titanium-vanadium deposit is hosted by troctolitic gabbro. Residual magmas and fluids resulting from extreme magmatic differentiation, possibly combined with assimilation of older crust, created mineral deposits including cryolite that was mined at Ivigtut, large low-grade deposits of uranium-rare earth elements-zinc at Kvanefjeld and tantalum-niobium-rare earth element-zirconium at Kringlerne, in the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex, as well as tantalum-niobium-rare earth elements at Motzfeldt S{\o} in the Igaliko complex. The South Greenland crustal evolution records effects of mantle processes, such as lithospheric extension, subduction and underplating, which resulted in recurrent magma emplacement in tectonically active environments. As such, the geology of South Greenland reflects events and circumstances that are favourable to the generation and preservation of hydrothermal ore-forming fluid systems during the Ketilidian orogeny as well as to the development of extreme rock compositions within the Gardar alkaline igneous province.},

abstract = {The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia is the most nickel-sulfide-endowed komatiite belt in the world. The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt contains two mineralised units/horizons that display very different volcanological and geochemical features. The Mt Keith unit comprises {\textgreater}500 m-thick spinifex-free adcumulate-textured lenses, which are flanked by laterally extensive orthocumulate-textured units. Spinifex texture is absent from this unit. Disseminated nickel sulfides, interstitial to former olivine crystals, are concentrated in the lensoidal areas. Massive sulfides are locally present along the base or margins of the lenses or channels. The Cliffs unit is locally {\textgreater}150 m thick and comprises a sequence of differentiated spinifex-textured flow units. The basal unit is the thickest, and contains basal massive nickel-sulfide mineralisation. The Mt Keith and Cliffs units display important common features: (i) MgO contents of 25–30{\%} in inferred parental magmas; and (ii) Al/Ti ratios of ∼20 (Munro-type). However, the Mt Keith unit is highly crustally contaminated (e.g. LREE-enriched, high HFSEs), whereas the Cliffs unit does not display evidence of significant crustal assimilation. We argue that the distinct trace-element concentrations and profiles of the two komatiite units reflect their different emplacement style and country rocks: the Mt Keith unit is interpreted to have been emplaced as an intrusive sill into dacitic volcanic units whereas the Cliffs unit was extruded as lava flow onto tholeiitic basalts in a subaqueous environment. The mode of emplacement and nature of country rock is the single biggest factor in controlling mineralisation styles in komatiites. On the other hand, evidence of crustal contamination does not necessarily provide information of the prospectivity of komatiites to host Ni–Cu–(PGE) mineralisation, despite being a good proxy for the style of komatiite emplacement and the nature of country rocks.},

abstract = {Fluid inclusion petrography and vein mineral textures indicative of boiling have been characterized in 855 samples from epithermal precious metals deposits along the Veta Madre at Guanajuato, Mexico. Mineral textures and fluid inclusions characteristic of fluid immiscibility or boiling, including colloform quartz, plumose/feathery/flamboyant quartz, lattice-bladed calcite and lattice-bladed calcite replaced by quartz, as well as coexisting liquid-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions and assemblages of vapor-rich only inclusions, have been identified in mineralized samples from the Veta Madre. Most samples studied were assayed for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Sb, and were divided into ore grade and sub-economic samples based on the gold and silver concentrations. For silver, samples containing {\textgreater} 100 ppm were classified as ore grade, and ore grade gold samples contained {\textgreater} 1 ppm Au. The feature that is most closely associated with ore grades of both gold and silver is colloform quartz that was originally precipitated as amorphous silica, and this feature also shows the largest difference in average grade between samples that show colloform texture (178.8 ppm Ag and 1.1 ppm Au) and those that do not exhibit this texture (17.2 ppm Ag and 0.2 ppm Au). Statistical analysis of the data confirmed the petrographic observations that indicated that colloform quartz is the feature that has the greatest predictive power for distinguishing between ore grade and sub-economic samples. For both Ag and Au, there is no significant difference in average grade of samples containing coexisting liquid-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions or assemblages of vapor-only inclusions and those that do not, suggesting that fluid inclusion evidence for boiling is not correlative with ore grades. This result is consistent with the fact that most forms of silica that are precipitated during boiling do not trap useful fluid inclusions. The results of this study suggest that mineral textures and fluid inclusions provide complementary information that should both be used in exploration for epithermal precious metal deposits. Metal grades and boiling intensity of samples collected along a traverse perpendicular to the Veta Madre and above known economic mineralization are both low at relatively short distances away from the vein and increase as the vein is approached. This suggests that mineralogical and fluid inclusion evidence for boiling are restricted to the immediate vicinity of, and increase in the direction of, mineralized veins and may be used in exploration to establish vectors towards vein systems that may host precious metal mineralization. Previous studies of epithermal systems show that the Ag and Au mineralization zone is most often located at or above the bottom of the boiling zone. In this regard, the presence of abundant evidence for boiling that is observed in the deepest levels of the Veta Madre that have been sampled suggests that additional precious metal mineralization may be present beneath the deepest levels that have been explored.},

abstract = {We report Hf isotopic data for over 50 well studied lower crustal samples from three Proterozoic and Phanerozoic regions in southwest Europe, eastern Australia and southern Mexico. We use these data to characterize the Lu-Hf isotopic composition of the lower crust and, in combination with existing Sm-Nd data, to constrain coupled Hf-Nd isotopic behavior and evolution within this reservoir. Although most of these samples have present-day parent/daughter (p/d) ratios consistent with Hf-Nd evolution within the terrestrial Hf-Nd array, some samples have divergent p/d ratios that would evolve out of the terrestrial array in 1 Ga or less. The present-day 176Hf/177Hf and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic compositions of all samples, with one lone exception, plot within the terrestrial array. This indicates that (1) some present-day p/d ratios may be a relatively recently acquired characteristics through magmatic or metamorphic processes not related to the time-integrated Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios of their sources, and/or (2) the Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd p/d variations exist on a small hand-size scale but not necessarily on a larger scale. The lower crust, from this initial data set, is broadly similar to the upper crust in terms of both its present-day p/d values and time-integrated Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd evolution. As a result, the lower crust appears to have a Hf and Nd isotopic composition similar to that of all other crust and mantle reservoirs so far characterized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Experimental study of natural alkalic lava compositions at low pressures (pO2∼QFM) reveals that crystallization of primitive lavas often occurs in the sequence olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, nepheline without “obvious” reaction relation. Pseudoternary liquidus projections of multiply saturated liquids coexisting with plagioclase (±olivine±clinopyroxene±nepheline) have been prepared to facilitate graphical analysis of the evolution of lava compositions during hypabyssal cooling. Use of (TiAl2)(MgSi2)−1 and Fe3+ (Al)−1 exchange components is a key aspect of the projection procedure which is succesful in reducing a wide range of compositions to a systematic graphical representation. These projections, and the experiments on which they are based, show that low pressure fractionation plays a significant role in the petrogenesis of many alkalic lava suites from both continental and oceanic settings. However, the role of polybaric fractionation is more evident in the major element chemistry of these lava suites than in many tholeiitic suites of comparable extent. For example, the lavas of Karisimbi, East Africa, show a range of compositions reflecting a polybaric petrogenesis from primitive picrites at 1360° C/18 kb and leading to advanced low pressure differentiates. Evolved leucite-bearing potassic members of this and other suites may be treated in a nepheline-diopside-kspar (+olivine+leucite) projection. Compositional curvature on the plagioclase+clinopyroxene+olivine+leucite cotectic offers a mechanism to explain resorption of plagioclase in alkalic groundmass assemblages and the incompatibility of albite and leucite. This projection is useful for evaluating the extent of assimilation of the alkalic portions of crustal granulites. Assimilation appears to have played some role in the advanced differentiates from Karisimbi.},

abstract = {Many of the early Cretaceous intrusive complexes in the Damaraland of west–central Namibia are silicic in composition. Although all have trace element characteristics typical for the so-called A-type granites, major differences in alkali/aluminum ratios and isotopic compositions require diverse magma sources. This paper presents Nd and O isotope data from the five largest silicic complexes (Paresis, Erongo, Brandberg, Cape Cross, Gross Spitzkoppe) that provide new constraints on the nature of crustal and mantle sources involved, and their relative proportions. The Paresis complex has an isotopic signature ($\delta$18O=+9‰, $\epsilon$Nd130 Ma=−21) indicating a crustal component similar to Mesoproterozoic gneisses of the Angola craton. The other complexes have isotope variations ($\delta$18O from +8.1‰ to +10.7‰ and $\epsilon$Nd130 Ma from −1 to −9) that can be explained by a binary mixing model between a mantle and crustal component. More importantly, this same mixing line also fits the Nd–O isotope variations reported from the mafic Okenyenya and Messum complexes, and from rhyodacites in the southern Etendeka volcanic sequence. The uniformity of the crustal component implied by this mixing model suggests lower crustal material, in contrast to the geologic complexity of the Neoproterozoic Damara Belt presently exposed at the surface. This is consistent with the isotopic data, and we interpret the crustal component to be lower crustal metametasediments that were dehydrated and perhaps melt-depleted by generation of the S-type granites, which are widespread in the Damara Belt. The mantle component is interpreted to be dominated by the Tristan mantle plume, but some involvement of depleted mantle material is needed to explain all of the isotope data. The data rule out any significant role for enriched, subcontinental mantle lithosphere. All silicic Damaraland complexes, as well as the Etendeka rhyodacites, classify as A-type granites despite their proven source diversity. This means that the A-type geochemical characteristics of these and, by analogy, other anorogenic granites, does not depend on a particular magma source. The unifying feature of the diverse granites in the Damaraland is likely to be related to the high temperatures involved, which allow partial melting of dehydrated, and possibly melt-depleted, lower crustal lithologies.},

The condition of water saturation is rare, implying that crustal magma genesis generally takes place under fluid-absent conditions or that any fluid present must contain volatile species other than H2O. The source and quantity of water present during partial melting profoundly affect the types of melting reactions, residues and magmas as well as subsequent magma evolution. For S-type granitic magmas, melting reactions involving muscovite breakdown in pelites yield low-temperature, "wet" melts that form veins, pockets and small plutons in regional metamorphic terranes. Biotite breakdown in pelites near the amphibolite-granulite facies transition yields hotter magmas with variable water contents. These are emplaced at medium to high levels. Under granulite facies conditions, biotite breakdown in quartzofeld-spathic rocks yields high-temperature, "dry" magmas emplaced as subvolcanic batholiths and volcanics. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The Angouran Zn-(Pb–Ag) deposit, Zanjan Province, NW Iran, is located within the central Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone of the Zagros orogenic belt. The deposit has proven and estimated resources of 4.7 Mt of sulfide ore at 27.7{\%} Zn, 2.4{\%} Pb, and 110 g/t Ag, and 14.6 Mt of oxidized carbonate ores at 22{\%} Zn and 4.6{\%} Pb. It is hosted by a metamorphic core complex that is unconformably overlain by a Neogene volcanic and evaporite-bearing marine to continental sedimentary sequence. The sulfide orebody, precursor to the significant nonsulfide ores, is located at the crest of an open anticline at the contact between Neoproterozoic to Cambrian footwall micaschists and hanging wall marbles. 40Ar–39Ar data on muscovite from mineralized and unaltered footwall micaschists suggest a rapid Mid-Miocene exhumation of the metamorphic basement (∼20 Ma) and yield an upper age constraint for mineralization. The fine-grained sulfide ore is massive, replacive, often brecciated, clearly postmetamorphic and dominated by Fe-poor sphalerite, with minor galena, pyrite, anhydrite, quartz, muscovite, dolomite, and rare calcite. Sphalerite contains Na–Ca–Cl brine inclusions (23–25 mass{\%} total dissolved solids) with homogenization temperatures of 180–70°C. Fluid inclusion chemistry (Na–K–Li–Ca–Mg–Cl–Br), ore geochemistry, S, and Pb isotope data suggest that the Angouran sulfide ore formed by the interaction of modified, strongly evaporated Miocene seawater and the lithotypes of an exhumed metamorphic core complex. Minor contributions of metals from Miocene igneous rocks cannot be excluded. Mineralization occurred in a collisional intra-arc setting with high heat flow, probably during the transition from an extensional to a compressional regime. The Angouran deposit may represent a new type of low-temperature carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb ore that is distinct from Mississippi Valley type and sedimentary-exhalative deposits.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Carbonatites host some of the largest and highest grade rare earth element (REE) deposits but the composition and source of their REE-mineralising fluids remains enigmatic. Using C, O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope data together with major and trace element compositions for the REE-rich Kangankunde carbonatite (Malawi), we show that the commonly observed, dark brown, Fe-rich carbonatite that hosts REE minerals in many carbonatites is decoupled from the REE mineral assemblage. REE-rich ferroan dolomite carbonatites, containing 8–15 wt{\%} REE 2 O 3 , comprise assemblages of monazite-(Ce), strontianite and baryte forming hexagonal pseudomorphs after probable burbankite. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (0.70302–0.70307) affirm a carbonatitic origin for these pseudomorph-forming fluids. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of strontianite, representing the REE mineral assemblage, indicate equilibrium between these assemblages and a carbonatite-derived, deuteric fluid between 250 and 400 °C ($\delta$ 18 O + 3 to + 5‰ VSMOW and $\delta$ 13 C − 3.5 to − 3.2‰ VPDB ). In contrast, dolomite in the same samples has similar $\delta$ 13 C values but much higher $\delta$ 18 O, corresponding to increasing degrees of exchange with low-temperature fluids ( {\textless} 125 °C), causing exsolution of Fe oxides resulting in the dark colour of these rocks. REE-rich quartz rocks, which occur outside of the intrusion, have similar $\delta$ 18 O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr to those of the main complex, indicating both are carbonatite-derived and, locally, REE mineralisation can extend up to 1.5 km away from the intrusion. Early, REE-poor apatite-bearing dolomite carbonatite (beforsite: $\delta$ 18 O + 7.7 to + 10.3‰ and $\delta$ 13 C −5.2 to −6.0‰; 87 Sr/ 86 Sr 0.70296–0.70298) is not directly linked with the REE mineralisation.},

abstract = {The early Eocene Skaergaard intrusion of Greenland includes enormous numbers of rocks of both exotic and cognate origins. The lower parts of the Marginal Border Series contain abundant fragments of feldspathic peridotite that are possibly autoliths, intermixed with occasional xenoliths of Precambrian gneiss and metasomatized Cretaceous–Paleocene sediments derived from adjoining country rocks. The Upper Border Series includes one exceptionally large block of gneiss (several hundred meters across), and numerous smaller fragments, these originating from the intrusion's footwalls, plus a few pieces of peridotite. The Layered Series contains countless autoliths of troctolite, gabbroic anorthosite, and oxide (magnetite-ilmenite) gabbro, broken from parts of the Upper Border Series that have otherwise been lost to erosion; at the upper midlevel of its western half, it contains a few xenoliths of basalt, derived probably from the now-eroded (Eocene) roof of the intrusion. A distinctive postintrusion composite basaltic dike at one place contains 40 or more xenoliths of troctolite, olivine gabbro, and gabbroic anorthosite that may represent parts of the Layered Series still hidden at depth. The Layered Series autoliths range from fragments a few centimeters on a side to blocks more than 400 m across, and they typically are coarser grained than their host cumulates, being in this respect more like Upper Border Series rocks. The autoliths are spread stratigraphically through the lower 70{\%} of the exposed 2500 m thickness of the Layered Series and are generally concentrated in three broad stratigraphic zones. Their physical relationships to their host rocks—particularly the way they indent older layers beneath and are covered by younger layers above—provide abundant evidence that there was generally a sharp, well-defined interface between the top of the cumulate pile and the main body of magma in the intrusion while the Layered Series was forming. The distribution of the autoliths between and through the well-known, rhythmic, thin, modally graded layers shows that these layers were spread by magmatic currents; and their relations to the more extensive macrorhythmic layering suggest that it too was significantly shaped by currents. Many of the larger autoliths are crudely layered internally, and in places it is evident that their stratification existed before they broke loose; therefore, it must have formed in the Upper Border Series. One particularly large block of oxide gabbro exhibits extraordinarily well-developed modal and textural layering and includes small troctolitic autoliths of an earlier generation, and it provides evidence that currents also spread crystalline materials across the top of the magma body. Many of the very small autoliths in the Layered Series are highly anorthositic in composition, apparently because they were leached of mafic minerals, and some of the larger blocks show local patchy internal replacement by anorthosite. Most large blocks show little sign of postaccumulation modification, and some have thin, fine-grained augite-rich rims or rinds, demonstrating that even though they were out of thermal and chemical equilibrium with their host cumulates, they still were effectively armored against extensive chemical change. Also documented is a large block that was cut by several early basaltic dikes before it broke free from the top of the intrusion; these early dikes transgress small anorthositic replacement pipes in the block, showing that the replacement process also occurred in the upper border environment. Two mechanisms are described whereby graded cumulate layers can be sorted and deposited by magmatic crystal-liquid suspension currents. One, involving density surge currents, has been advocated previously; the other is a new concept based on boundary flow separation and reattachment vortex cells. The two mechanisms are used in complementary ways to illustrate the formation of (1) some of the principal Skaergaard structures involving blocks and layers; (2) modally graded layers in the Layered Series that rhythmically alternate with uniform layers; and (3) modally sorted layers in the Upper Border Series featuring “underside draping” beneath small included blocks. Explanations are provided for (1) why plagioclase did not float away from the tops of graded layers even though it was less dense than the liquid, and (2) how the liquid part of a current was fractionated away from the crystalline materials. Modal and grain-size data from Skaergaard intrusion graded layers are shown to be in excellent accord with characteristics predicted for layers sorted by currents; a synthesis diagram is presented illustrating how all the above processes may have functioned in concert in the intrusion.},

The variation with temperature is contrary to most recorded variations of D, and is attributed to a compositional control in the phlogopite. D correlates with substitution of titanium in the phlogopite. Thus as the titanium content increases with increasing temperature, the barium content, and hence D, increases. Application of partitioning data for barium in models for lamproite genesis suggests that phlogopite of metasomatic origin, and possibly some barium-rich accessory phases, are present in the source rocks for lamproite, and phlogopite plays a major role in the generation of lamproitic magma. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The Gardar failed-rift Province is world-famous for its (per-)alkaline plutonic rocks. Elevated contents of F in the mantle source and F-enrichment in the parental melts have been suggested to account for the peculiarities of the Gardar rocks (e.g. their rare mineralogy, extreme enrichment of HFSE elements, Be or REE in the Il{\'{i}}maussaq agpaites, and the formation of the unique Ivigtut cryolite deposit). To constrain the formation and chemical evolution of F-bearing melts and fluids, fluorides (fluorite, cryolite, villiaumite, cryolithionite), calcite and siderite from the Il{\'{i}}maussaq, Motzfeldt and Ivigtut complexes were analysed for their trace element content focusing on the rare earth elements and yttrium (REE). The various generations of fluorite occurring in the granitic Ivigtut, agpaitic Il{\'{i}}maussaq and miaskitic to agpaitic Motzfeldt intrusions all share a negative Eu anomaly which is attributed to (earlier) feldspar fractionation in the parental alkali basaltic melts. This interpretation is supported by the abundance of anorthositic xenoliths in many Gardar plutonic rocks. The primary magmatic fluorites from Il{\'{i}}maussaq and Motzfeldt display very similar REE patterns suggesting a formation from closely related parental melts under similar conditions. Hydrothermal fluorites from these intrusions were used to constrain the multiple effects responsible for the incorporation of trace elements into fluorides: temperature dependence, fluid migration/interaction and complexation resulting in REE fractionation. Generally, the REE patterns of Gardar fluorides reflect the evolution and migration of a F/CO2-rich fluid leading to the formation of fluorite and fluorite/calcite veins. In certain units, this fluid inherited the REE patterns of altered host rocks. In addition, there is evidence of an even younger fluid of high REE abundance which resulted in highly variable REE concentrations (up to three orders of magnitude) within one sample of hydrothermal fluorite. The REE patterns of the granitic Ivigtut intrusion show flat to slightly heavy-REE-enriched patterns characterised by a strong tetrad effect. This effect is interpreted to record extensive fluid-rock interaction in highly fractionated, Si-rich systems. Interestingly, the fluorides appear to record different source REE patterns, as the spatially close Motzfeldt and Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusions show strong similarities and contrast with the Ivigtut intrusion located 100 km NE. These variations may be attributed to differences in the tectonic position of the intrusions or mantle heterogeneities. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Oldoinyo Lengai is situated within the Gregory Rift Valley (northern Tanzania) and is the only active volcano erupting natrocarbonatite lava. This study investigates the texture and mineralogy of the June 1993 lava at Oldoinyo Lengai, and presents petrographic evidence of liquid immiscibility between silicate, carbonate, chloride, and fluoride melt phases. The 1993 lava is a porphyritic natrocarbonatite consisting of abundant phenocrysts of alkali carbonates, nyerereite and gregoryite, set in a quenched groundmass, composed of sodium carbonate, khanneshite, Na-sylvite and K-halite, and a calcium fluoride phase. Dispersed in the lava are silicate spheroids ({\textless} 2 mm) with a cryptocrystalline silicate mineral assemblage wrapped around a core mineral. We have identified several textural features preserved in the silicate spheroids, melt inclusions, and carbonatite groundmass that exhibit evidence of silicate-carbonate, carbonate-carbonate and carbonate-halide immiscibility. Rapid quenching of the lava facilitated the preservation of the end products of these liquid immiscibility processes within the groundmass. Textural evidence (at both macro- and micro-scales) indicates that the silicate, carbonate, chloride and fluoride phases of the lava unmixed at different stages of evolution in the magmatic system.},

abstract = {A detailed tephrochronological study was carried out on the deep-sea core collected from Site 963A in the Sicily Channel during ODP Leg 160. The chronology of the succession is provided by an age–depth model based on isotope stratigraphy and quantitative eco-biostratigraphy. Major, trace and rare earth element content was obtained on single glass grains through electron probe micro-analysis and laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques from six well-preserved tephra layers, characterized by a discrete thickness found along the succession. These deposits were correlated with the volcanic activity of Pantelleria and dated at 42.5, 127.5, 128.1, 129.1, 188.7 and 197.7 ka. This detailed chemical characterization of the studied deposits aims to provide a valuable reference database for scientists working on both proximal and distal products erupted at Pantelleria island during the Late Pleistocene. This study, moreover, offers the opportunity to better identify Pantelleria-related marker tephras within the tephrochronological framework of the central and eastern Mediterranean area.

abstract = {Quartz-carbonate-Au vein deposits in the Timmins-Porcupine gold camp, Abitibi greenstone belt, have equivocal protracted parageneses and formed during late to post-Kenoran (2750–2670 Ma) deformation and metamorphism. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb, $\delta$18O, and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) rare earth element (REE) depth-profiling techniques were employed on unpolished wall-rock zircons to resolve temporal constraints on mineralization and hydrothermal fluid sources at Hoyle Pond and Pamour Mines. Depth-profiling techniques successfully uncovered {\textless}3-$\mu$m alteration domains in zircon rims based on Th/U, REE, and isotopic signatures, and rim 207Pb/206Pb ages are significantly younger than host-rock ages. Zircon alteration is from a complex interplay of recrystallization and localized dissolution-reprecipitation of the crystals during hydrothermal fluid flow. Alteration of Hoyle Pond and Pamour zircons at 2660 Ma correlates to intensely mineralized and deformed quartz-carbonate-Au shear veins, and this age represents peak fluid infiltration at the mines, coinciding with peak regional metamorphism. Subsequent zircon alteration correlating to thin, shallow-dipping and less altered or mineralized vein networks occurred at ca. 2640 Ma, and this age likely represents a late hydrothermal fluid pulse at the end of regional retrograde metamorphism. Protracted hydrothermal alteration along discrete zones within the camp continued into the Proterozoic. Zircon alteration occurs as light REE-enriched “rims,” and Th/U and 18O values of alteration domains suggest that the source had a limited crustal recycling component. Whereas the underutilized depth-profiling technique has resolved {\~{}}200 m.y. of continuous crustal evolution and fluid flow in the southern Abitibi, further investigation of the southern Abitibi is required to clarify the genetic relationship between ore mineralization and zircon alteration.},

abstract = {Experiments carried out on the system SiO2-NaAlSi3O8-KAlSi3O8(Qz-Ab-Or) at 1 kbar in the presence of H2O and F show that the quartz-alkali feldspar field boundary is progressively displaced towards the feldspar join as F contents increase from 0 to 4 wt. {\%}F. Increasing {\{}Mathematical expression{\}}, in the absence of F, has already been shown to have a similar effect (Tuttle and Bowen 1958; Luth, Jahns, and Tuttle 1964). The increased size of the quartz field in the F-bearing system compared to the hydrous system is believed to be caused by progressive removal of Al from the tetrahedral network of the melt by complexing with F. The residual network in the melt is thus enriched in Si and this stabilizes precipitation of quartz rather than feldspar for certain bulk compositions. The common presence of quench cryolite (Na3AlF6) in certain experiments carried out with 4 wt.{\%} F supports this interpretation and indicates that some Al in the melt may be present in six-fold coordination with F-. The effect of H2O in the absence of F may be similar, with Al being progressively removed from four-fold coordination as more H2O is dissolved in the melt. Although a proportion of Al in hydrous melts may occur in six-fold coordination, dry melts predominantly contain Al in four-fold coordination. This major difference in Al complexing may be one of the main causes for differences in the high-pressure phase relations of wet and dry Albearing silicate systems. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The composition of olivine phenocrysts in Hawaiian tholeiitic picrites and in Mid-Ocean Ridge picrites vary up to Mg{\#}91.3 and Mg{\#}92.1 respectively. The compositions and liquidus temperatures of the magmas crystallizing the most magnesian phenocrysts can be estimated and we find that anhydrous liquidus temperatures (at 1 bar pressure) of Hawaiian tholeiitic picrites average 1365°C, for E-MOR picrites average 1355°C, and for N-MOR picrites average 1335°C. Water contents of the magmas decrease in the order Hawaiian picrites, E-MOR picrites to N-MOR picrites, and consideration of liquidus depression by these water contents leads to the conclusion that magma temperatures for all types were approximately 1325°C at ∼ 1 bar. The data from parental or primary magmas suggests that the temperature contrast between ‘Hot-Spot and MOR magmas is ≤ 20°C. Application of information from partial melting studies of lherzolites and liquidus studies of the Hot-Spot and MOR picrites leads to the conclusion that both ‘Hot-Spot' and MOR primary basalts are derived from mantle with potential temperature Tp ∼ 1430°C. Insofar as primitive magmas may be used to infer the potential temperature of their sources, there is no evidence for a temperature contrast of $\Delta$ Tp = 100–250°C between ‘Hot-Spot' or ‘Deep Mantle Plume' sources and ambient (MOR source) asthenospheric mantle. Although magma temperatures are similar, the residual mantle compositions for Hawaiian picrites are refractory harzburgites, more refractory (including Cr/Cr+Al ratio) than the lherzolite to harzburgite residue from MOR picrite extraction. It is argued that the buoyancy plume and geophysically anomalous mantle beneath the Hawaiian Arch is due to compositional and not temperature contrasts in the upper mantle. The four-component mixing identified in the Hawaiian source is attributed to interaction between old subducted lithospheric slabs, buoyant or suspended in the upper mantle, and surrounding ambient mantle at Tp = 1430°C.},

abstract = {Approximately {\textgreater}50{\%} of global rare earth element (REE) resources are hosted by carbonatite related deposits, of which monazite is one of the most important REE minerals. Monazite dominates more than 30 carbonatite-related REE deposits around the world, including currently exploited mineralization at Bayan Obo and Mount Weld. These deposits are widely distributed across all continents, except Antarctica. Though rare, monazite occurs as the primary mineral in carbonatite, and mostly presents as a secondary mineral that has a strong association with apatite. It can partially or completely replace thin or thick overgrowth apatite, depending on the availability of REE. Other mineral phases that usually crystallize together with monazite include barite, fluorite, xenotime, sulfide, and quartz in a carbonate matrix (e.g., dolomite, calcite). This review of monazite geochemistry within carbonatite-related REE deposits aims to provide information regarding the use of monazite as a geochemical indicator to track the formation history of the REE deposits and also supply additional information for the beneficiation of monazite. The chemical compositions of monazite are highly variable, and Ce-monazite is the dominant solid solution in carbonatite related deposits. Most monazite displays steep fractionation from La to Lu, absent of either Eu or Ce anomalies in the chondrite normalized REE plot. The other significant components are huttonite and cheratite. Some rare sulfur-bearing monazite is also identified with an SO3 content up to 4 wt {\%}. A 147Sm/144Nd ratio with an average {\~{}}0.071 for monazite within carbonatite-related ores is similar to that of their host rocks ({\~{}}0.065), and is the lowest among all types of REE deposits. Sm/Nd variation of monazite from a single complex reflects the differentiation stage of magma, which decreases from early to late. Based on the differences of Nd and Sr abundances, Nd isotopic composition for monazite can be used to track the magma source, whereas Sr isotopic composition records the signatures of the fluid source. Th-(U)-Pb age determination of the secondary monazite records variable thermal or metasomatic disturbances, and careful geochronological interpretation should be brought forward combined with other lines of evidence. ThO2 is the most difficult contamination in the beneficiation of monazite, luckily, the ThO2 content of monazite within carbonatite is generally low ({\textless}2 wt {\%}).},

abstract = {Chemical variation in biotite from the KJokken gabbro-syenite intrusion in the Proterozoic Gardar province in South Greenland has been investigated by electron probe and, for F and Li, ion microprobe. Most mica occurs in small amounts as fringes on ilmenomagnetite or fayalite, rarely as an intercumulus or poikilitic phase. The micas range continuously from Phlog70Ann30 in a gabbro, to Phlog4Ann96 in the most evolved (slightly persilicic and peralkaline) syenite. In the syenites Fe-Mg partitioning between biotite and olivine can be described by a single distribution coefficient, Kd = XF XBiotMs/XBiotFe ∼3, suggesting that these reactant phases mix ideally at the reaction T. Experimental data for Fe-Mg exchange via aqueous chloride solutions (Schulien, 1980) imply low T (∼32Q°C). F was absent in the experiments and may significantly affect the exchange equilibrium. Kd in the gabbros is ∼ 1, consistent with equilibrium via a fluid depleted in F because of crystallization of large amounts of amphibole.Al, Mn, and Ti vary regularly throughout the series and can be used as markers of cryptic variation in the layered syenites. (Al + Si): 22 O is always in the range 7.7–7.85. A1/(A1 + Si) decreases from ∼0.31 in gabbros to 0.25 in the most Fe-rich micas. Li is always {\textless} 260 ppm w. In the syenite series, F shows a near-linear inverse relationship with Fe/(Fe + Mg) which passes close to OF at Ann100 with ∼l.4 wt{\%} F(0–7 F to 44 positive charges) at Ann44. Biotites in the gabbro unit (which forms an outer sheath to the intrusion) have relatively less F, probably because it was consumed by coexisting amphibole. $\delta$I8O is similar for both gabbros and syenites, and it is unlikely that an envelope fluid was involved in the reactions. G reaches a maximum of 0.3 wt. {\%} in biotite except for that in one syenite sample with 0–7 wt. {\%}. Calculation of relative F-OH fugacities from the reaction OH-phlogopite + F-annite = F-phlogopite + OH-annite, as calibrated by Munoz (1984), appears to suggest that each horizon in the layered series was in equilibrium with a slightly different fluid. In view of the intimate interleaving of these lithologies, this is improbable. The equilibrium constant of the exchange reaction, obtained from the experimental data, seems not to be appropriate to the Klokken assemblage, or to other examples of regular F-Fe avoidance. Explanations may include short-range Fe-Mg ordering in the natural examples or the effect of additional components in the fluid. F contents are high in comparison with biotites from calc-alkaline complexes; high magmatic F may account for the igneous layering common in the Gardar. Temperatures calculated from reactions involving fayalite and magnetite show that most biotites grew subsolidus. The F-poor annites grew {\textgreater} 300 °C subsolidus even when texturally intercumulus. Stable isotope data are consistent with the separation and retention of a deuteric fluid during the final stage of magmatic crystallization. Klokken was not generally subject to the pervasive, long-range (in both distance and time) dydrothermal interactions demonstrated in calcalkaline and theleiitic intrusions, although more extensive fluid flow is indicated for the more permeable laminated syenites. The biotites preserve chemical variation indicating local equilibrium with other mafic phases, and halogens provide a useful marker of subsolidus fluid flow.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the partitioning behavior of trace elements between solid and liquid is a prerequisite for modern igneous and mantle petrology. Most of the mathematical models simulating melt generation, migration and evolution within the mantle and/or the crust require the availability of reliable solid/liquid partition coefficients for the mineral phases involved in the process. Calcic amphiboles are extremely important for the understanding of lithospheric processes because of both their common occurrence in a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks types and their capability of hosting a large number of geochemically important trace elements. A series of studies on the partitioning behavior of trace elements between calcic amphibole and silicate melt have therefore been carried out at different pressures, temperatures and system compositions during the last 15 years. However, due to the complex crystal chemistry of amphiboles, only few studies focused on the role of crystal structure and composition on amphibole-liquid partition coefficients (Amph/LD). In this chapter, present knowledge of the solid/ liquid trace element partitioning between calcic amphiboles and silicate melt is summarized and the role played by the crystal structure and melt composition on Amph/LD variations is highlighted in addition to the effects of pressure and temperature. The dataset used in this chapter includes only the results of experimental studies performed under well constrained P-T conditions for which trace element determinations were carried out with highly sensitive in situ microanalytical techniques. The available dataset considered in this work are listed in Table 1⇓. Although far less common than the calcic amphiboles, potassic-richterites are potentially important in the generation of potassic magmatic rocks and in re-enrichment processes occurring in the subcontinental mantle lithosphere sampled as xenoliths in kimberlites.

abstract = {The 2004–2008 dome-building eruption at Mount St. Helens ended during winter 2007–2008 at a time when field observations were hampered by persistent bad weather. As a result, recognizing the end of the eruption was challenging—but important for scientists trying to understand how and why long-lived eruptions end and for public officials and land managers responsible for hazards mitigation and access restrictions. In hindsight, the end of the eruption was presaged by a slight increase in seismicity in December 2007 that culminated on January 12–13, 2008, with a burst of more than 500 events, most of which occurred in association with several tremor-like signals and a spasmodic burst of long-period earthquakes. At about the same time, a series of regular, localized, small-amplitude tilt events—thousands of which had been recorded during earlier phases of the eruption—came to an end. Thereafter, seismicity declined to 10–20 events per day until January 27–28, when a spasmodic burst of about 50 volcano-tectonic earthquakes occurred over a span of 3 h. This was followed by a brief return of repetitive “drumbeat” earthquakes that characterized much of the eruption. By January 31, however, seismicity had declined to 1–2 earthquakes per day, a rate similar to pre-eruption levels. We attribute the tilt and seismic observations to convulsive stagnation of a semisolid magma plug in the upper part of the conduit. The upward movement of the plug ceased when the excess driving pressure, which had gradually decreased throughout the eruption as a result of reservoir deflation and increasing overburden from the growing dome, was overcome by increasing friction as a result of cooling and crystallization of the plug.},

abstract = {Whole-rock trace-element analyses can be used in conjunction with partition coefficients and mineral modes to calculate a liquidus-temperature equilibrium distribution of trace elements among the constituent minerals of cumulate rocks. Once the concentration of a trace element in a given mineral phase is known, then the trace-element concentration in the liquid that was in equilibrium with this mineral can be calculated if certain assumptions are made about the temperature and major-element chemistry of the liquid. The effects of a trapped melt fraction (TMF) are accounted for by: (1) including in the calculation a phase (the trapped melt) with a mineral/melt partition coefficient of 1; and (2) adjusting the rock's mode to reflect removal of the TMF. The method yields results comparable to those given by mineral separation or in situ analysis for trace elements. ?? 1994.},

Initial eruption of basalt from a plume head should be preceded by ∼1000 m of domal uplift. High-temperature magmas are expected to dominate the first eruptive products of a new plume and should be concentrated near the centre of the volcanic province.

abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) comprise the fifteen elements of the lanthanide series as well as yttrium, and may be found in over 250 different minerals. These elements are required for many different applications such as high-strength permanent magnets, catalysts for petroleum refining, metal and glass additives and phosphors used in electronic displays. The only REE bearing minerals that have been extracted on a commercial scale are bastn{\"{a}}site, monazite, and xenotime. These minerals may be beneficiated using gravity, magnetic, electrostatic and flotation separation techniques. Increased demand for the different products manufactured from REE has resulted in a constriction of supply from China, which currently produces 97{\%} of the world's rare earths, via export quotas. Many new rare earth deposits are currently being developed to help meet the demand void created by the Chinese export quotas, however most of these developing deposits include rare earth minerals for which there is limited processing knowledge. This paper examines the separation techniques that are currently employed for rare earth mineral beneficiation and identifies areas in need of further research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although carbonatites potentially contain a larger concentration of rare earth elements (REEs) than any rock type, the origin of the REE mineralization in the world's largest Bayan Obo carbonatite-related deposit is still disputed. In order to clarify the mechanism of REE mineralization, carbonatite samples from three large REE deposits in China, Daluxiang, Maoniuping and Bayan Obo were compared. The REE minerals in Daluxiang and Maoniuping carbonatites show constant light REE (LREE) enrichment (chondrite normalized (La/Nd)Nratios {\textgreater} 1), whereas those in Bayan Obo H8 dolomite marbles show variable (La/Nd)Nratios. The REE abundances and patterns of the REE minerals in Maoniuping carbonatites are similar to those in the barite, calcite and thread vein-hosted ores. The calcites in Daluxiang and Maoniuping carbonatites are characterized by enrichments of Pb, Sr and REEs, which is consistent with an igneous origin. They have similar REE contents and patterns to the corresponding bulk rocks, suggesting that these carbonatites are calcite-rich cumulates. During crystallization and accumulation of calcites, the REEs become enriched in carbonatite-expelled fluids because of the very low partition coefficients for these elements between carbonate minerals and melt. These fluids interact with the country rocks to produce fluorite-rich REE mineralization. The fluorites in Daluxiang and Maoniuping deposits are characterized by high Sr contents and REE patterns that vary from LREE enriched to LREE depleted. The former has relatively higher Sr and lower heavy REE (HREE) concentrations than those in Maoniuping, which is consistent with the differences found in carbonatites and calcites from the two locations. In addition, the high MnO, Sr and REE contents of dolomites in REE-Nb-Fe host H8 dolomite marble in Bayan Obo support the hypothesis that the rock is of igneous origin. In situ analyses show compositional differences between coarse- and fine-grained dolomites. The latter has higher Nb and LREEs, and lower FeO and207Pb/206Pb and208Pb/206Pb ratios. Our data confirm previous interpretations of the complex, multistage nature of REE and Nb mineralization at Bayan Obo, in which the ore is produced by reaction between carbonatite-derived fluids and the ore host dolomite marbles. This hypothesis is supported by the age of adjacent carbonatite dykes, which have the same age range as ore formation. A similar REE mineralization model is proposed for the Daluxiang and Maoniuping carbonatite deposits. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A much-revised Quaternary stratigraphy is presented for ignimbrites and pumice fall deposits of the Bandas del Sur, in southern Tenerife. New 40Ar{\&}sol;39Ar data obtained for the Arico, Granadilla, Fasnia, Poris, La Caleta and Abrigo formations are presented, allowing correlation with previously dated offshore marine ashfall layers and volcaniclastic sediments. We also provide a minimum age of 287±7 ka for a major sector collapse event at the G{\"{u}}imar valley. The Bandas del Sur succession includes more than seven widespread ignimbrite sheets that have similar characteristics, including widespread basal Plinian layers, predominantly phonolite composition, ignimbrites with similar extensive geographic distributions, thin condensed veneers with abundant diffuse bedding and complex lateral and vertical grading patterns, lateral gradations into localized massive facies within palaeo-wadis, and widespread lithic breccia layers that probably record caldera-forming eruptions. Each ignimbrite sheet records substantial bypassing of pyroclastic material into the ocean. The succession indicates that Las Ca{\~{n}}adas volcano underwent a series of major explosive eruptions, each starting with a Plinian phase followed by emplacement of ignimbrites and thin ash layers, some of co-ignimbrite origin. Several of the ignimbrite sheets are compositionally zoned and contain subordinate mafic pumices and banded pumices indicative of magma mingling immediately prior to eruption. Because passage of each pyroclastic density current was characterized by phases of non-deposition and erosion, the entire course of each eruption is incompletely recorded at any one location, accounting for some previously perceived differences between the units. Because each current passed into the ocean, estimating eruption volumes is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, the consistent widespread distributions and the presence of lithic breccias within most of the ignimbrite sheets suggest that at least seven caldera collapse eruptions are recorded in the Bandas del Sur succession and probably formed a complex, nested collapse structure. Detailed field relationships show that extensive ignimbrite sheets (e.g. the Arico, Poris and La Caleta formations) relate to previously unrecognized caldera collapse events. We envisage that the evolution of the nested Las Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera is more complex than previously thought and involved a protracted history of successive ignimbrite-related caldera collapse events, and large sector collapse events, interspersed with edifice-building phases.},

It has been recognized for some time that these blocks now have compositions and textures that differ markedly from those of the units from which they came. They tend to be more plagioclase rich and seem to have lost mafic components to the surrounding gabbro. Numerical simulations coupling crystallization, melting, and heat and mass transfer for a multicomponent system show how the blocks reacted with the mush in which they were emplaced. Enhanced cooling and crystallization of a compositionally stratified mush adjacent to the blocks resulted in patterns of melt compositions similar to those of layering around the blocks. Volume changes during crystallization and melting induced convection of the interstitial melt leading to changes in the bulk compositions of the blocks and the surrounding mush. Inhomogeneities such as inclusions are likely to facilitate the onset of compositional convection in a chemically stratified solidification zone.},

abstract = {New trace-element and Nd-isotope analyses were carried out on the Coppermine River basalts, a suite of 1.77 Ga old continental flood basalts in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Although all the samples are tholeiitic basalts, their chemical and isotopic compositions change upwards in the sequence. The lowermost unit has relatively high contents of SiO2 and incompatible trace elements, high ratios of elements with different compatibilities (e.g., Th/Nb, La/Sm), high Gd/Yb, negative Nb anomalies, and low epsilon(Nd). Samples at the top of the sequence have less pronounced enrichment and fractionation of incompatible elements coupled with an absence of Nb anomalies and positive epsilon(Nd) values. These results are interpreted to indicate that the lavas lowest in the sequence were produced by melting in the garnet stability field, al depths greater than 90 km, and probably in a mantle plume beneath the continental lithosphere. These magmas passed through magma chambers in the lower and upper crust where they became contaminated with crustal rocks. During the course of the eruption of the entire volcanic sequence the extent of crustal contamination became minimal and the lavas lost the chemical signature of residual garnet. The youngest lavas formed by melting in the spinel field and were free of crustal contamination. The site of mantle melting apparently became shallower, perhaps because of lithosphere thinning.},

abstract = {Oceanic sediments deposited at high rate close to continents are dominated by terrigenous material. Aside from dilution by biogenic components, their chemical compositions reflect those of nearby continental masses. This study focuses on oceanic sediments coming from the juvenile Canadian Cordillera and highlights systematic differences between detritus deriving from juvenile crust and detritus from old and mature crust. We report major and trace element concentrations for 68 sediments from the northernmost part of the Cascade forearc, drilled at ODP Sites 888 and 1027. The calculated weighted averages for each site can then be used in the future to quantify the contribution of subducted sediments to Cascades volcanism. The two sites have similar compositions but Site 888, located closer to the continent, has higher sandy turbidite contents and displays higher bulk SiO2/Al2O3 with lower bulk Nb/Zr, attributed to the presence of zircons in the coarse sands.Comparison with published data for other oceanic sedimentary piles demonstrates the existence of systematic differences between modern sediments deriving from juvenile terranes (juvenile sediments) and modern sediments derived from mature continental areas (cratonic sediments). The most striking systematic difference is for Th/Nb, Th/U, Nb/U and Th/Rb ratios: juvenile sediments have much lower ratios than cratonic sediments. The small enrichment of Th over Nb in cratonic sediments may be explained by intracrustal magmatic and metamorphic differentiation processes. In contrast, their elevated Th/U and Nb/U ratios (average values of 6.87 and 7.95, respectively) in comparison to juvenile sediments (Th/U{\~{}}3.09, Nb/U{\~{}}5.15) suggest extensive U and Rb losses on old cratons. Uranium and Rb losses are attributed to long-term leaching by rain and river water during exposure of the continental crust at the surface. Over geological times, the weathering effects create a slow but systematic increase of Th/U with exposure time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Geochronological data indicate that the Natkusiak magmatic assemblage of the Franklin large igneous province coincided with onset of the Sturtian glaciation. The Natkusiak was emplaced into an evaporite basin and entrained significant quantities of sulfur, which would have led to extensive SO 2 and H 2 S outgassing in hot convective plumes. The largest of these plumes could have penetrated the tropopause, leading to stratospheric sulfate aerosol formation and an albedo increase sufficient to force a Snowball. Radiative forcing was maximized by the equatorial location of the Franklin and the cool Neoproterozoic background climate, which would have lowered the tropopause height, increasing the rate of stratospheric aerosol injection. Our results have implications for understanding Phanerozoic mass extinction events, exoplanet habitability, and aerosol perturbations to the present-day climate.},

Analysis of an scanning electron microscopy (SEM) back-scatter gray-scale traverse at a resolution of one pixel = 2.43 $\mu$m revealed 145 zones over 5130 $\mu$m, whereas a detailed high-resolution (one pixel = 0.195 $\mu$m) section near the crystal rim revealed 225 zones over 795 $\mu$m. In order to mathematically characterize the zoning pattern, wavelet, Fourier, and nonlinear analysis techniques were used on profiles of the SEM gray-scale data, and a series constructed was from the zone widths. Results demonstrate that the zircon oscillatory zoning preserves nonlinear and periodic components. Secondary ion mass spectrometry, electron microprobe, and SEM analyses of trace elements show the SEM back-scatter bright zones are enriched in U, Th, and rare earth elements (REE) in comparison to the darker zones. REE patterns are sharply heavy REE enriched and have negative Eu anomalies and prominent positive Ce anomalies. We model the oscillatory zoning, including a measure of its chemical variation, by use of a periodically forced nonlinear system. Results of this data-driven model are quantitatively similar to the natural data. We envisage that the small-scale oscillatory zoning was the result of a nonlinear feedback process wherein the crystal growth modified the adjacent melt, which in turn affected the crystal composition. The large-scale harmonic zones likely reflect changes in the bulk geochemistry of the system from which the zircon grew.},

abstract = {The restriction of most carbonatites to continental areas raises questions as to whether the parental liquids to carbonatites are generated within the continental lithosphere, or whether they are derived from deeper parts of the mantle with the lithosphere playing a subsidiary, but important, role in trapping volatile-rich melts/fluids. The constraints imposed by both radiogenic and stable isotopic data from carbonatites world-wide are consistent with a sub-lithospheric source for the parental melts, associated with either asthenospheric ‘upwellings' or more deep-seated, plume-related activity. Crucial evidences that support the generation of carbonated melts from sub-lithospheric mantle are: the petrogenetic and temporal association of carbonatites with large igneous provinces (LIPs; e.g., Deccan, Parana), carbonatites with primitive noble gas isotopic signatures, radiogenic isotope ratios similar to OIBs (i.e. involving HIMU, EM1 and FOZO mantle components), and the uniform, time-integrated Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd development lines for Sr and Nd isotopic data for carbonatites from the Superior Province, Canada, and the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Such findings are difficult to reconcile with a lithospheric origin. Even if a metasomatized lithospheric mantle is considered to be the sole source of carbonated melts, an unknown mantle process is required, large enough to generate widespread, synchronous metasomatism spanning regions in excess of 1 × 106 km2.},

abstract = {Three principal granite provinces are defined across SE Asia, as follows. (1) The Western Thailand–Myanmar/Burma province consists of hornblende–biotite I-type granodiorite–granites and felsic biotite–K-feldspar (± garnet ± tourmaline) granites associated with abundant tin mineralization in greisen-type veins. New ion microprobe U–Pb dating results from Phuket Island show zircon core ages of 212 ± 2 and 214 ± 2 Ma and a thermal overprint with rims of 81.2 ± 1.2 and 85–75 Ma. (2) The North Thailand–West Malaya Main Range province has mainly S-type biotite granites and abundant tin mineralization resulting from crustal thickening following collision of the Sibumasu plate with Indochina during the Mid-Triassic. Biotite granites around Kuala Lumpur contain extremely U-rich zircons (up to 38000 ppm) that yield ages of 215 ± 7 and 210 ± 7 Ma. (3) The East Malaya province consists of dominantly Permian–Triassic I-type hornblende–biotite granites but with subordinate S-type plutons and A-type syenite–gabbros. Biotite–K-feldspar granites from Tioman Island off the east coast of Malaysia also yield a zircon age of 80 ± 1 Ma, showing Cretaceous magmatism in common with province 1. Geological and U–Pb geochronological data suggest that two east-dipping (in present-day coordinates) subduction zones are required during the Triassic, one along the Bentong–Raub Palaeo-Tethyan suture, and the other west of the Phuket–Burma province 1 belt.

abstract = {After a long period of subaerial fissure-fed extrusions of basaltic magmas ( 12 to {\textgreater} 3 Ma) volcanic activity was then concentrated in the central part of Tenerife. Phonolitic magma chambers formed and a central volcanic complex was constructed (the Las Canadas edifice). The formation of a large depression (the Las Canadas caldera) truncated the top of the edifice. The active twin strato-cones Teide—Pico Viejo are sited in this depression. The history of the Las Canadas caldera and edifice are established from stratigraphy, geochronology (K—Ar dates) and volcanological studies. Two different groups are recognized, separated by a major unconformity. The Lower Group is dated at 2 to 3 Ma and includes the products of several volcanic centres, which together represent several cycles. The Upper Group ranges from 1.56 to 0.17 Ma and includes three different formations representing three long-term ( 100 to 300 Ka) volcanic cycles. The periods of dormancy between each formation were of 120 to 250 Ka duration. The Las Canadas caldera is a multicyclic caldera which formed over the period 1.18–0.17 Ma. Each cycle of activity represented by a formation culminated in caldera collapse which affected different sectors of the Las Canadas edifice. Geological observation and geochronology support an origin by collapse into a magma chamber. The minimum volume of pyroclastic ejecta is substantially greater than the present caldera depression volume (45 km3), but approaches the inferred volume of the original caldera depression ({\textgreater} 140 km3). After the formation of the caldera, sector collapses could also occur at the northern flank of the volcano causing the disappearance of the northern side of the caldera wall.},

Melt H2O concentrations increase linearly with incompatible elements, demonstrating that H2O contents were not buffered significantly during fractionation by any crystalline or vapor phase. The relatively low H2O contents of pantellerites are consistent with an origin by partial melting of alkali gabbros rather than fractional crystallization of basalt. Preeruptive H2O concentrations do not correlate with the volume or explosivity of pantellerite eruptions; decompression history is critical in determining the style of pantellerite (and other) eruptions.},

abstract = {The crystal structures of synthetic K-dravite [XKYMg 3 Z Al 6 T Si6O18(BO3) 3 V (OH) 3 W (OH)], dravite [XNaYMg 3 Z Al 6 T Si6O18(BO3) 3 V (OH) 3 W (OH)], oxy-uvite [XCaYMg 3 Z Al 6 T Si6O18(BO3) 3 V (OH) 3 W O], and magnesio-foitite [X☐Y(Mg2Al)ZAl 6 T Si6O18(BO3) 3 V (OH) 3 W (OH)] are investigated by polarized Raman spectroscopy, single-crystal structure refinement (SREF), and powder X-ray diffraction. The use of compositionally simple tourmalines characterized by electron microprobe analysis facilitates the determination of site occupancy in the SREF and band assignment in the Raman spectra. The synthesized K-dravite, oxy-uvite, and magnesio-foitite have significant Mg–Al disorder between their octahedral sites indicated by their respective average 〈Y–O〉 and 〈Z–O〉 bond lengths. The Y- and Z-site compositions of oxy-uvite (YMg1.52Al1.48(10) and ZAl4.90Mg1.10(15)) and magnesio-foitite (YAl1.62Mg1.38(18) and ZAl4.92Mg1.08(24)) are refined from the electron densities at each site. The Mg–Al ratio of the Y and Z sites is also determined from the relative integrated peak intensities of the Raman bands in the O–H stretching vibrational range (3250–3850 cm−1), producing values in good agreement with the SREF data. The unit cell volume of tourmaline increases from magnesio-foitite (1558.4(3) {\AA}3) to dravite (1569.5(4)–1571.7(3) {\AA}3) to oxy-uvite (1572.4(2) {\AA}3) to K-dravite (1588.1(2) {\AA}3), mainly due to lengthening of the crystallographic c-axis. The increase in the size of the X-site coordination polyhedron from dravite (Na) to K-dravite (K) is accommodated locally in the crystal structure, resulting in the shortening of the neighboring O1–H1 bond. In oxy-uvite, Ca2+ is locally associated with a deprotonated W (O1) site, whereas vacant X sites are neighbored by protonated W (O1) sites. Increasing the size of the X-site-occupying ion does not detectably affect bonding between the other sites; however, the higher charge of Ca and the deprotonated W (O1) site in oxy-uvite are correlated to changes in the lattice vibration Raman spectrum (100–1200 cm−1), particularly for bands assigned to the T 6O18 ring. The Raman spectrum of magnesio-foitite shows significant deviations from those of K-dravite, dravite, and oxy-uvite in both the lattice and O–H stretching vibrational ranges (100–1200 and 3250–3850 cm−1, respectively). The vacant X site is correlated with long- and short-range changes in the crystal structure, i.e., deformation of the T 6O18 ring and lengthening of the O1–H1 and O3–H3 bonds. However, X-site vacancies in K-dravite, dravite, and oxy-uvite result only in the lengthening of the neighboring O1–H1 bond and do not result in identifiable changes in the lattice-bonding environment.},

abstract = {The probable sources of some of the famous Indian diamonds are the 1.2??Ga old Krishna lamproites of Southern India, a rare Proterozoic occurrence of lamproites which are usually Cretaceous or younger in age. In this study we report Nd, Sr, Pb and Hf isotopes and multiple trace element concentrations of the Krishna lamproites. The goals are to evaluate mantle-processes and the petrogenesis of these ultrapotassic rocks of extreme chemical composition in light of these geochemical data, including their major element compositions. The Krishna lamproites show nearly uniform, parallel rare earth element (REE) distribution patterns with high concentrations and extreme light-REE enrichment (La/Yb(N) = 41-88), high average concentrations of Ba (??? 1200??ppm), Sr (??? 1200??ppm), Zr (??? 930??ppm), La (??? 230??ppm), high U/Pb and Th/U ratios with notable absence of any Eu-anomaly. These rocks are typically porphyritic without any evidence of crystal accumulation, and have moderately high Mg-numbers (59-73) along with high Ni (average ??? 301??ppm, highest 819??ppm) and Cr (average ??? 183??ppm, highest 515??ppm) concentrations that show a positive correlation with MgO (wt.{\%}), implying a role of olivine in the melt source. The low SiO2 content (lowest 37.8{\%}, average 49{\%}) and high Nb (average 147??ppm), Zr, Sr, as well as Ni and Cr in these rocks indicate lack of upper continental crustal contribution in the genesis of these rocks. The initial Pb-isotopic composition of these lamproites is unusual in that in a 207Pb/204Pb vs. 206Pb/204Pb plot, these rocks plot to the left of the 1.2??Ga geochron (age of emplacement), unlike most mantle-derived rocks. This Pb-isotopic signature and the superchondritic Nb/Ta ratios (average 23.6) of these rocks rule out their derivation from a metasomatized sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The high 207Pb/204Pb at low 206Pb/204Pb indicates an Archean component in the source of these rocks. We argue that this Archean crustal component, which produced the low-SiO2 lamproites along with the high Ni and Cr must have been ultrabasic, and we propose a model in which these lamproites formed by partial melting of metasomatized, subducted Archean komatiite in a peridotite mantle-source assemblage. In addition, these rocks display initial Hf isotopic compositions similar to Al-depleted komatiites, and high Nb/U, Nb/Th, and TiO2 as well as low Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (1.1-4.2) and average CaO/Al2O3 of ??? 1.6 that are also similar to Archean komatiites. This is also supported by the initial Pb isotopic composition of the Krishna lamproites, requiring evolution in a variably high U/Pb, Th/Pb reservoir early in earth history, possibly resulting from preferential segregation of Pb relative to U and Th in the sulfides of the komatiite. The Al-depleted subducted komatiitic component was enriched by carbonate metasomatism in the peridotitic mantle. This metasomatism was responsible for the observed Nd-Hf isotope characteristics, specifically variable ??Nd(T) at relatively constant ??Hf(T) in the lamproites. This Nd-Hf-isotopic characteristic seems to be common in global lamproites of all ages. Our proposed model for the genesis of the Krishna lamproites involving a subducted komatiitic source may also be applicable for other global lamproites from cratonic settings, as older komatiite-bearing subducted crustal components were possibly ubiquitous in the architecture of ancient cratonic mantle. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Morphology-derived lava flow rheology is a frequently used tool in volcanology and planetary science to determine rheological parameters and deduce the composition of lavas on terrestrial planets and their moons. These calculations are usually based on physical equations incorporating 1) lava flow driving forces: gravity, slope and flow-rate and 2) morphological data such as lava flow geometry: flow-width, -height or shape of the flow outline. All available methods assume that no geometrical changes occur after emplacement and that the measured flow geometry reflects the lava's apparent viscosity and/or yield strength during emplacement. It is however well-established from terrestrial examples that lava flows may inflate significantly after the cessation of flow advance. This inflation affects, in turn, the width-to-height ratio upon which the rheological estimates are based and thus must result in uncertainties in the determination of flow rheology, as the flow height is one of the key parameters in the morphology-based deduction of flow properties. Previous studies have recognized this issue but, to date, no assessment of the magnitude of this error has been presented. This is likely due to a lack of digital elevation models (DEMs) at sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution. The 2014/15 Holuhraun eruption in central Iceland represents one of the best monitored large volume (1.5 km3) lava flow fields (85 km2) to date. An abundance of scientific field and remote sensing data were collected during its emplacement. Moreover, inflation plays a key role in the emplacement dynamics of the late stage of the lava field. Here, we use a time series of high resolution DEMs acquired by the TanDEM-X satellite mission prior, during and after the eruption to evaluate the error associated with the most common methods of deriving lava flow rheology from morphological parameters used in planetary science. We can distinguish two dominant processes as sources of error in the determination of lava flow rheology from morphology 1) wholesale inflation of lava channels and 2) post halting inflation of individual lava toes. These result in a 2.4- to 17 - fold overestimation of apparent viscosity and a 0.7- to 2.4 - fold overestimation of yield strength. When applied in planetary sciences, this overestimation in rheological parameters translates directly to an overestimation of the respective lavas silica content. We conclude that, although qualitatively informative, morphological analysis is insufficient to discern lava rheology and composition. Instead, in-situ analysis together with high resolution remote sensing data is needed to properly constrain the compositions involved in planetary volcanism.},

abstract = {Primitive rocks that are related to continental flood basalts are rare, but often reveal crucial information on the ultimate sources of these huge outpourings of mantle-derived magma. Here we present mineral chemical data for mafic and ultramafic dikes from the Antarctic extension of the Jurassic ({\~{}}180Ma) Karoo continental flood basalt province that was emplaced during the initial stages of the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent. We concentrate on two previously recognized high-Ti dike rock suites (Group 3 and Group 4) that exhibit high MgO contents (up to 22wt.{\%}). Both groups are characterized by Mg-rich olivine phenocrysts (up to Fo90) that are not mantle xenocrysts and indicate derivation from relatively Mg-rich parental magmas. Orthopyroxene is a common phenocryst and groundmass phase indicating emplacement at mid-crustal pressures (2-5kbar; depth of {\~{}}10-20km). The parental magmas of Group 3 and Group 4 dikes can be associated with pyroxenite sources on the basis of high olivine NiO, high whole-rock Zn/Fe, and low whole-rock CaO. In the case of Group 3 dikes, however, the samples that contain the most Mg-rich olivine also exhibit the mildest pyroxenite fingerprint and indications of an additional olivine-bearing (peridotitic) source component. We propose that the pyroxenite fingerprint of Group 3 and Group 4 dikes reflects relatively low-degree melting of fertile mantle at high pressures beneath the thick and cold Gondwanan lithosphere. Such conditions limited high-degree melting of peridotite sources which may have been more predominant in the generation of the Karoo low-Ti basalts within lithospheric thinning zones. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios determined by laser fluorination analysis on olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase separated from 31 Oligocene flood basalts and rhyolites from Yemen display small but significant variations (5{\textperiodcentered}1–6{\textperiodcentered}2‰ for olivine; 5{\textperiodcentered}5–6{\textperiodcentered}9‰ for clinopyroxene; 5{\textperiodcentered}9–6{\textperiodcentered}9‰ for plagioclase). The range in $\delta$18O values exceeds: (1) the analytical reproducibility of the technique (±0{\textperiodcentered}15‰; 2 SD); (2) the range expected for minerals that would have crystallized from uncontaminated oceanic basalts or primary magmas in equilibrium with mantle peridotite; (3) the range in melt values and equilibrium phenocryst compositions that could be produced by fractional crystallization of these magmas. Samples with the highest $\delta$18O values exhibit increases in 87Sr/86Sr ratio, decreases in 143Nd/144Nd ratio, and increasing Pb isotopic heterogeneity. Samples with the lowest $\delta$18O values have radiogenic isotope ratios that approach those inferred for the Afar plume. The oxygen isotope data provide unequivocal evidence that assimilation of heterogeneous lower and upper Pan-African crust was the primary control on isotopic variation in this continental flood basalt province. Moreover, new radiogenic and oxygen isotope data for Pan-African crustal samples from Yemen have appropriate crustal isotopic compositions to generate the observed isotopic variations in the volcanic rocks. A near-primary high-MgO basalt with low $\epsilon$Nd and extreme Pb isotope ratios contains strongly zoned clinopyroxene crystals that range from green cores through to greenish brown, brownish green and dark brown or black rims. Handpicked crystals of each colour type display the following correlated range in isotope ratios: 87Sr/86Sr = 0{\textperiodcentered}7036–0{\textperiodcentered}7049; 143Nd/144Nd = 0{\textperiodcentered}5129–0{\textperiodcentered}5127; 206Pb/204Pb = 18{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}9; $\delta$18O = 5{\textperiodcentered}67–6{\textperiodcentered}86‰. The Sr–Nd–Pb–O isotope variations are attributed to rapid assimilation of ∼25{\%} Pan-African continental crust by hot mafic magma during clinopyroxene crystallization. Contamination in this flood basalt province varied from combined assimilation and fractional crystallization to rapid assimilation of crust by hot mafic magmas with little fractionation. Laser fluorination oxygen isotope analysis of mineral separates allows small differences in $\delta$18O to be correlated with radiogenic isotope data and is a powerful tool for evaluating the relative roles of enriched lithospheric mantle and continental crust in suites of continental flood basalts.},

@article{Draper1999,
abstract = {We report new experimental results obtained under nominally anhydrous conditions at 1.0-1.5 GPa on a synthetic melt whose composition is typical of extreme-composition xenolith glasses. These results demonstrate that part of this extreme compositional range is in equilibrium with a lherzolitic assemblage (olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene on the liquidus), extending our earlier findings [D.S. Draper, T.H. Green P-T phase relations of silicic, alkaline, aluminous mantle-xenolith glasses under anhydrous and C-O-H fluid-saturated conditions, J. Petrol. 38 (1997) 1187-1224] showing saturation with harzburgite minerals (olivine and orthopyroxene on the liquidus). The new results strengthen the view that such liquids can readily coexist with upper mantle rocks. Our results also bear on the current debate regarding the nature of low-degree mantle melts between proponents of the diamond-aggregate technique [who argue for comparatively silica- and alkali-rich low-degree melts; e.g., M.B. Baker, M.M. Hirschmann, M.S. Ghiorso, E.M. Stolper, Compositions of near-solidus peridotite melts from experiments and thermodynamic calculations. Nature 375 (1995) 308-311; M.B. Baker, M.M. Hirschmann, L.E. Wasylenki, E.M. Stolper, M.S. Ghiorso, Quest for low-degree mantle melts, Nature 381 (1996) 286] and those favoring the sandwich technique [who question the value of the diamond-aggregate work and argue that near-solidus melts must be nepheline- and olivine-normative; T.J. Falloon, D.H. Green, H.St.C. O'Neill, C.G. Ballhaus, Quest for low-degree mantle melts. Nature 381 (1996) 285; T.J. Falloon, D.H. Green, H.St.C. O'Neill, W.O. Hibberson, Experimental tests of low degree peridotite partial melt compositions: implications for the nature of anhydrous near-solidus peridotite melts at 1 GPa, Earth Planet, Sci. Lett. 152 (1997) 149-162]. Our results support aspects of both views. The sandwich-technique view is supported, for example, because all our liquids coexisting with mantle minerals are nepheline- and olivine-normative: and our olivine-liquid Fe-Mg exchange K(D) values fall on a trend similar to that supported by those workers. The diamond-aggregate view is supported, for example, because we find equilibrium between highly silicic, alkaline liquids and mantle minerals, showing the effect of high alkali contents to allow high silica contents at silica activities buffered by magnesian olivine and orthopyroxene at low pressure [M.M. Hirschmann, M.B. Baker, E.M. Stolper. The effect of alkalis on the silica content of mantle-derived melts, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 62 (1998) 883-902]. Additionally, the melting trends put forward by the sandwich-technique workers include revised low-degree melt compositions, as reported by Hirschmann et al., and our compositions fall on extensions of these trends. These new analyses also yield an olivine-liquid K(D) that more closely follows the trend of K(D) vs. melt alkali contents. The views of both sides of this controversy appear to permit, under certain conditions, the existence of small amounts of melt in the upper mantle with compositions similar to the extreme-compositions xenolith glasses that are the focus of our work. On the basis of our new results, we conclude that extreme-composition xenolith glasses can act as agents of cryptic metasomatism in the upper mantle.},

@article{Choi2012,
abstract = {In contrast to the smooth trends of major elements and mineral compositions, the excluded trace elements in the Skaergaard Layered Series have an irregular distribution that does not conform to the normal trends of Rayleigh-type fractionation. Their concentrations are about constant or even decline through the Lower and Middle Zones before increasing sharply to reach maximum concentrations 100–200 m above the Sandwich Horizon. As in the case of included elements, the relative concentrations of excluded elements in coexisting phases deviate widely from those predicted by experimentally determined partition coefficients under presumed magmatic conditions. This is seen most clearly in the immiscible melanogranophyres and conjugate ferrogabbros. Although the major elements conform to the experimentally determined relations for immiscible liquids, the trace elements do not; they follow a totally independent trend. The abrupt increase in the concentrations of excluded elements in the upper part of the intrusion could plausibly be attributed to an addition of new magma or to a density inversion that resulted in upward migration of a late liquid or fluid, but these possibilities are inconsistent with the compositional and spatial relations of the upper parts of the intrusion. Although a late residual liquid certainly migrated upward, the most likely explanation for the observed distribution of excluded elements is that the partition coefficients were altered by volatile components, which gradually increased during the early stages of crystallization then began to exsolve near the top of the Middle Zone.},

abstract = {The structural environments of trace levels (≤0.2 wt{\%}) of La3+, Gd3+, and Yb3+ in several silicate glasses were examined as a function of melt composition and polymerization using Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Glass compositions were albite, sodium trisilicate, and a peralkaline composition approximately halfway between the two. Yb is 5–6 coordinated [￼]. Gd coordination ranges from 6 in albite glass [￼] through a mixture of 6 to 8 in peralkaline glass [￼]to 8 in sodium trisilicate glass [￼]. La is 7-coordinated in the peralkaline and sodium trisilicate glasses [￼], but has a coordination of 8–9 in albite glass [￼]. Regularity of the rare earth site (i.e., the range of REE-O distances) appears to decrease as polymerization increases. This is caused, in part, by the decreasing number of non-bridging oxygens in the coordination sphere of the rare earth element with increasing melt polymerization. Regularity of the rare earth site also appears to increase as the size of the rare earth decreases. This is due to the greater ability of the smaller, higher field strength rare earths to compete for non-bridging oxygens. An exception to these trends is the La site in albite glass; it is more regular than in the other glasses because the large La ion is centered in the “cage” formed by interconnected rings of Si-and Al-tetrahedra, which leads to a more regular distribution of La-O bond lengths. As polymerization decreases, the rare earth's local environment is more strongly influenced by its bonding requirements and less influenced by network topology.},

abstract = {The K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t Complex (1275±1.8 Ma) in the Gardar Alkaline Province, South Greenland, cuts Archaean gneisses and comprises two intersecting syenitic stocks and a gabbroic ring-dyke. The magmas, with increasingly more primitive compositions, were emplaced successively by ring-faulting and roof stoping. The syenites are orthocumulates (cumulus alkali feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, titanomagnetite and apatite; intercumulus phases include alkali amphibole, biotite, quartz and calcite). In the well dissected earlier stock, a 2.2 km-thick layered sequence displays graded modal layering, feldspar lamination and cryptic layering. Modal layering in both stocks is directed mainly inwards at 35°–50°. Heterogeneous nucleation of the cumulus assemblage, close to steep thermal boundary layers, is inferred. The modal layering is ascribed primarily to gravitational sorting aided by the large density differential between a) feldspar and b) Fe-rich silicates and oxides. Episodic collapse of cumulus + melt slurries contributed to inward-dipping crystal pediments on the chamber floors. The Ring-Dyke (up to 100 m wide) is nearly continuous through 360°. K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t exhibits a compositional near-continuum from olivine gabbro through syenite intermediaries to alkali granite, ascribed to protracted assimilation/fractional crystallization processes. The most radiogenic Nd isotope data from K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t ($\epsilon$Ndi values between −3.3 and −1.0) point to a lithospheric mantle source, whereas the most unradiogenic values imply enrichment in LREE by crustal contamination of the magmas.},

Partition coefficients for many elements in olivine and pyroxene decrease with increasing peralkalinity and undersaturation of the magma, i.e. with decreasing polymerisation. The REE partition coefficients for olivine and pyroxene also show dependence on the mineral chemistry, i.e. the iron content. Probably due to the larger lattice sites in the iron end-members the heavy REEs enter the small six-coordinated lattice sites with increasing ease as the iron content of the mineral increases. La and Ce partition coefficients for apatite increase with increasing peralkalinity; this condition seems to stabilise a Na-REE-phosphate component in the mineral.},

abstract = {The Ti content of biotite can serve as a geothermometer for graphitic, peraluminous metapelites that contain ilmenite or rutile and have equilibrated at roughly 4-6 kbar. The relationship between Ti-content, temperature, and Mg/(Mg + Fe) value was calibrated empirically using an extensive natural biotite data set (529 samples) from western Maine and south-central Massachusetts in combination with the petrogenetic grid of Spear et al. (1999). The calculated Ti-saturation surface is curved such that for a given Mg/(Mg + Fe) value, Ti concentration increases as a function of temperature in a nonlinear fashion, and for a given temperature Ti concentrations decrease with an increase in Mg/(Mg + Fe). The fit to the Ti-saturation surface can be reformulated as the geothermometric expression: T = ln(Ti) - a - c(XMg)3/b0.333, in which T is temperature in degrees Celsius, Ti is the number of atoms per formula unit (apfu) normalized on the basis of 22 O atoms, XMg is Mg/(Mg + Fe), a = -2.3594, b = 4.6482 x 10-9 and c = -1.7283. The calibration range for this expression is XMg = 0.275-1.000, Ti = 0.04-0.60 apfu, and T = 480-800 degreesC. Precision of the Ti-in-biotite geothermometer is estimated to be +/-24 degreesC at the lower temperature range and improves to +/-12 degreesC at higher temperatures. Application of the Ti-in-biotite geothermometer to ilmenite- or rutile-bearing, graphitic, peraluminous metapelites equilibrated at 3-6 kbar is generally consistent with independent temperature determinations, but with some deviations that represent local reequilibration. Consequently, the Ti systematics in biotite can also serve as the basis of a very sensitive indicator of chemical equilibrium, or lack thereof. Application of the geothermometer to metapelites not containing the requisite mineral assemblages can lead to minor-to-significant errors in estimated temperatures. Biotite Ti-substitution mechanisms are controlled by several factors. Based on the biotite calibration data set, magnesian biotites (XMg {\textgreater} 0.65) incorporate Ti in accordance with the exchange vector TiAl2R-1Si-2, where R is the sum of the divalent cations Mg + Fe + Mn. This substitution mechanism is primarily a response to misfit of the octahedral and tetrahedral layers in magnesian biotites. Intermediate biotites (XMg {\textless}0.65), particularly at higher temperatures, exhibit enhanced Ti concentrations, most consistent with the Ti-deprotonation TiO2R-1(OH) -2 exchange vector. Dominance of Ti-deprotonation substitution is largely a function of reduction of H2O activity at higher metamorphic grades. Supplementary biotite data from metaluminous amphibolites and mafic granulites, metamorphosed isothermally with variable H2O activities, reveal that low-Al biotite incorporates significantly higher concentrations of Ti relative to peraluminous biotite as a result of a combination of the exchange vectors TiO2R-1(OH) -2 and RSiAl-2 substituting in roughly an 8:1 ratio.},

abstract = {Rare earth elements are commonly assumed to substitute only for Ca in clinopyroxene because of the similarity of ionic radii for REE(3+) and Ca(2+) in eightfold coordination. The assumption is valid for Mg-rich clinopyroxenes for which observed mineral/melt partition coefficients are readily predicted by the lattice strain model for substitution onto a single site (e.g., Wood and Blundy 1997). We show that natural Fe-rich pyroxenes in both silica-undersaturated and silica-oversaturated magmatic systems deviate from this behavior. Salites (Mg{\#} 48-59) in phonolites from Tenerife, ferrohedenbergites (Mg{\#} 14.2-16.2) from the rhyolitic Bandelier Tuff, and ferroaugites (Mg{\#} 9.6-32) from the rhyolitic Rattlesnake Tuff have higher heavy REE contents than predicted by single-site substitution. The ionic radius of Fe(2+) in sixfold coordination is substantially greater than that of Mg(2+); hence, we propose that, in Fe-rich clinopyroxenes, heavy REE are significantly partitioned between eightfold Ca sites and sixfold Fe and Mg sites such that Yb and Lu exist dominantly in sixfold coordination. We also outline a REE-based method of identifying pyroxene/melt pairs in systems with multiple liquid and crystal populations, based upon the assumption that LREE and MREE reside exclusively in eightfold coordination in pyroxene. Contrary to expectations, interpolation of mineral/melt partition coefficient data for heavy REE does not predict the behavior of Y. We speculate that mass fractionation effects play a role in mineral/melt lithophile trace element partitioning that is detectable among pairs of isovalent elements with near-identical radii, such as Y and Ho, Zr and Hf, and Nb and Ta.},

The degree of the tetrad effect (TE1,3) is estimated and plotted vs. K/Rb, Sr/Eu, Eu/Eu*, significant tetrad effects are strictly confined to highly differentiated samples. Mineral fractionation as a cause for the tetrad effect is not supported by a calculated Rayleigh fractionation, which also could not explain the fractionation trends of Sr/Eu and Eu/Eu*. The strong decrease of Eu concentrations is highly evolved rocks suggests that Eu fractionates between the residual melt and a coexisting aqueous high-temperature fluid. Mineral fractionation as a reason for the tetrad effect is even more unlikely as REE patterns of accessory minerals display similar tetrad effects as the respective host rocks. The accessory minerals inherit the REE signature of the melt and do not contribute to the bulk-rock tetrad effect via mineral fractionation. These results point in summary to significant changes of element fractionation behavior in highly evolved granitic melts: ionic radius and charge, which commonly control the element distribution between mineral and melt, are no longer the exclusive control. The tetrad effect and the highly fractionated trace element ratios of Y/Ho and Zr/Hf indicate a trace element behavior that is similar to that in aqueous systems in which chemical complexation is of significant influence. This distinct trace element behavior and the common features of magmatic-hydrothermal alteration suggest the increasing importance of an aqueous-like fluid system during the final stages of granite crystallization. The positive correlation of TE1,3 with bulk-rock fluorine contents hints at the importance of REE fluorine complexation in generating the tetrad effect. As the evolution of a REE pattern with tetrad effect (M-type) implies the removal of a respective mirroring REE pattern (W-type), the tetrad effect identifies open system conditions during granite crystallization.},

abstract = {Linear chains of volcanic ocean islands are one of the most distinctive features on our planet. The longest, the Hawaiian–Emperor Chain, has been active for more than 80 million years, and is thought to have formed as the Pacific Plate moved across the Hawaiian mantle plume, the hottest and most productive of Earth's plumes. Volcanoes fed by the plume today form two adjacent trends, including Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, that exhibit strikingly different geochemical characteristics. An extensive data set of isotopic analyses shows that lavas with these distinct characteristics have erupted in parallel along the Kea and Loa trends for at least 5 million years. Seismological data suggest that the Hawaiian mantle plume, when projected into the deep mantle, overlies the boundary between typical Pacific lower mantle and a sharply defined layer of apparently different material. This layer exhibits low seismic shear velocities and occurs on the Loa side of the plume. We conclude that the geochemical differences between the Kea and Loa trends reflect preferential sampling of these two distinct sources of deep mantle material. Similar indications of preferential sampling at the limit of a large anomalous low-velocity zone are found in Kerguelen and Tristan da Cunha basalts in the Indian and Atlantic oceans, respectively. We infer that the anomalous low-velocity zones at the core–mantle boundary are storing geochemical anomalies that are enriched in recycled material and sampled by strong mantle plumes.

abstract = {Anhydrous nepheline, jadeite, and albite glasses doped with F as well as hydrous F-containing haplogranitic glasses were investigated using 19F combined rotation and multiple-pulse spectroscopy; 19F → 29Si cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (MAS); and high-power 19F decoupled 29Si, 23Na, and 27Al MAS nuclear magnetic resonance methods. Fluorine preferentially coordinates with Al to form octahedral AlF63− complexes in all glasses studied. In addition, F anions bridging two Al cations, units containing octahedral Al coordinated by both O and F, or tetrahedral Al-F complexes might be present. The presence of Si-F bonds cannot be entirely ruled out but appears unlikely on the basis of the 19F → 29Si CP/MAS spectra. There is no evidence for any significant coordination of F with alkalis in the glasses studied. 23Na spectra are identical for the samples and their F-free equivalents and the spectra do not change upon decoupling of 19F. The speciation of F in the hydrous and anhydrous glasses appears to be very similar. Over the range of F contents studied ( up to 5 wt.{\%} ), there seems to be hardly any dependence of F speciation on the concentration of F in the samples. The spectroscopic results explain the decrease of the viscosity of silicate melts with increasing F content by removal of Al from bridging AlO4-units due to complexing with F, which causes depolymerization of the melt. The same mechanism can account for the shift of the eutectic point in the haplogranite system to more feldspar-rich compositions with increasing F content, and for the peraluminous composition of most F-rich granites. Liquid immiscibility in F-rich granitic melts might be caused by formation of (Na,K)3AlF6 units in the melt with little or no interaction with the silicate component. The presence of F in granitic melts might increase the solubility of high field strength cations by making nonbridging O atoms available which form complexes with these cations.},

abstract = {To investigate the crystallization of pyroxene in spinifex-textured komatiites, we undertook a series of experiments in which compositions in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 CMAS system were cooled rapidly in a thermal gradient. Cooling rates were generally between 5 and 10 ?C h-1, but some runs were made at 100-200 ?C h-1; thermal gradients were between 10 and 20 ?C cm-1. These conditions reproduced those at various depths in the crust of komatiite lava flow. The starting composition was chosen to have pigeonite on the liquidus, and most of the experimental charges crystallized zoned pigeonite-diopside crystals like those in komatiite lavas. An intriguing aspect of the experimental results was their lack of reproducibility. Some experiments crystallized forsterite, whereas others that were run under similar conditions crystallized two pyroxenes and no forsterite; some experiments were totally glassy, but others crystallized entirely to pyroxene. The degree of supercooling at the onset of pyroxene crystallization was variable, from less than 25 ?C to more than 110 ?C. We attribute these results to the difficulty of nucleation of pyroxene under the conditions of the experiments. In some cases forsterite crystallized metastably and modified the liquid composition to inhibit pyroxene crystallization; in others no nucleation took place until a large degree of supercooling was achieved, and then pyroxene crystallized rapidly. Pigeonite crystallized under a wide range of conditions, at cooling rates from 3 to 100 ?C h-1. The notion that this mineral only forms at low cooling rates is not correct. ? 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic and trace element compositions of basalts and pantellerites from the island of Pantelleria (Strait of Sicily) have been used to constrain the evolution of these magmas and their sources. All Pantelleria products have isotopic compositions that plot in SrPb, NdPb and SrNd space between DMM and HIMU oceanic mantle sources. The Pantelleria basalts have variable Ce Pb, Nb U and Th U, and some have elevated 207Pb204Pb and 208Pb204Pb, which is indicative of the addition of an older component that resembles old enriched lithosphere sampled by potassic magmas in the circum-Tyrrhenian Sea. It is proposed that the relatively homogeneous pantellerites derive their Ce Pb, Nb U, and OIB-like Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions from a well-mixed crustal magma chamber supplied by heterogeneous basalts. We propose further that the radiogenic 206Pb204Pb and 143Nd144Nd, coupled with the unradiogenic Sr isotopic composition of some of the Pantelleria basalts, are inherited in a process involving chemical modification of the thinned lithospheric crust-mantle source by addition of basaltic (MORB) materials, a process that may have occurred intermittently at least since the Permo-Triassic. This process is responsible for lowering the Pb concentration and changing the U Pb and Th Pb ratios of portions of the lithospheric crust-mantle boundary. It is envisaged that the increase in $\mu$ and $\omega$ of the modified lithospheric mantle was caused by the addition of phases such as clinopyroxene and amphibole, crystallized in equilibrium with MORB. After chemical exchange with the asthenospheric mantle ceased during the Hercynian orogeny, this young (or rejuvenated) lithosphere evolved a radiogenic Pb isotopic composition. It is proposed that the isotopic differences observed between the volcanic rocks erupted in the Strait of Sicily and those erupted in the southern margin of the Tyrrhenian abyssal plain are primarily the result of mixing between magmas derived from a variably modified lithospheric source, some of it with OIB-type isotopic characteristics, that were developed by intermittent interaction with asthenospheric melts in a geodynamic regime dominated by extension. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The apparent equilibrium constants of the above reactions are discussed along with a proposed thermodynamic model. The29Si chemical shifts assigned to each structural unit increase linearly with alkali oxide contents. The slope of these lines decreases as the numbers of attached bridging oxygen (BO) atoms decrease. The average chemical shifts also increase linearly with an increase of alkali content.

Samples from the 1988 eruption of White Island, New Zealand were selected because petrographic evidence suggests that all three mineral phases are in equilibrium with each other and with the melt inclusions. All three phenocryst types are found as mineral inclusions within each of the other phases, and mineral inclusions often coexist with melt inclusions in growth-zone assemblages. Compositions of melt inclusions do not vary between the different host minerals, suggesting that boundary layer processes did not affect compositions of melt inclusions and that post-trapping modifications have not occurred. Partition coefficients were calculated from the host and melt inclusion compositions and results were compared to published values. All trace elements examined in this study except Sr are incompatible in plagioclase, and all measured trace elements except for Mn are incompatible in orthopyroxene. In clinopyroxene, Sc, V, and Mn are compatible, and Y, Ti, HREE, and the MREE are only slightly incompatible. Most partition coefficients overlap the wide range of values reported in the literature, but the White Island data are consistently at the lower end of the range in published values. Results from the literature obtained using modern microanalytical techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) or proton induced X-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) also fall at the lower end of the published values, whereas partition coefficients determined from bulk analysis of glass and crystals separated from volcanic rocks typically extend to higher values. Rapid crystal growth-rates, crystal zonation, or the presence of accessory mineral inclusions in phenocrysts likely accounts for the wide range and generally higher partition coefficients obtained using bulk sampling techniques. The results for 3+ cations from this study are consistent with theoretical predictions based on a lattice strain model for site occupancy. The results also confirm that the melt inclusion-mineral (MIM) technique is a reliable method for determining partition coefficients, as long as the melt inclusions have not experienced post-entrapment reequilibration. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The present work is a first comprehensive study of the trace-element composition and zoning in clinopyroxene- and amphibole-group minerals from carbonatites, incorporating samples from 14 localities worldwide (Afrikanda, Aley, Aln{\"{o}}, Blue River, Eden Lake, Huayangchuan, Murun, Oka, Ozernaya Varaka, Ozernyi, Paint Lake, Pinghe, Prairie Lake, Turiy Mys). The new electron-microprobe data presented here significantly extend the known compositional range of clinopyroxenes and amphiboles from carbonatites. These data confirm that calcic and sodic clinopyroxenes from carbonatites are not separated by a compositional gap, instead forming an arcuate trend from nearly pure diopside through intermediate aegirine–augite compositions confined to a limited range of CaFeSi2O6 contents (15–45 mol{\%}) to aegirine with {\textless} 25 mol{\%} of CaMgSi2O6 and a negligible proportion of CaFeSi2O6. A large set of LA-ICPMS data shows that the clinopyroxenes of different composition are characterized by relatively low levels of Cr, Co and Ni (≤ 40 ppm) and manifold variations in the concentration of trivalent lithophile and some incompatible elements (1–150 ppm Sc, 26–6870 ppm V, 5–550 ppm Sr, 90–2360 ppm Zr, and nil to 150 ppm REE), recorded in some cases within a single crystal. The relative contribution of clinopyroxenes to the whole-rock Rb, Nb, Ta, Th and U budget is negligible. The major-element compositional range of amphiboles spans from alkali- and Al-poor members (tremolite) to Na–Al-rich Mg- or, less commonly, Fe-dominant members (magnesiohastingsite, hastingsite and pargasite), to calcic–sodic, sodic and potassic–sodic compositions intermediate between magnesio-ferrikatophorite, richterite, magnesioriebeckite, ferri-nyb{\"{o}}ite and (potassic-)magnesio-arfvedsonite. In comparison with the clinopyroxenes, the amphiboles contain similar levels of tetravalent high-field-strength elements (Ti, Zr and Hf) and compatible transition elements (Cr, Co and Ni), but are capable of incorporating much higher concentrations of Sc and incompatible elements (up to 500 ppm Sc, 43 ppm Rb, 1470 ppm Sr, 1230 ppm Ba, 80 ppm Pb, 1070 ppm REE, 140 ppm Y, and 180 ppm Nb). In some carbonatites, amphiboles contribute as much as 25{\%} of the Zr + Hf, 15{\%} of the Sr and 35{\%} of the Rb + Ba whole-rock budget. Both clinopyroxenes and amphiboles may also host a significant share ({\~{}} 10{\%}) of the bulk heavy-REE content. Our trace-element data show that the partitioning of REE between clinopyroxene (and, in some samples, amphibole) and the melt is clearly bimodal and requires a revision of the existing models assuming single-site REE partitioning. Clinopyroxenes and amphiboles from carbonatites exhibit a diversity of zoning patterns that cannot be explained exclusively on the basis of crystal chemistry and relative compatibility of different trace-element in these minerals. Paragenetic analysis indicates that in most cases, the observed zoning patterns develop in response to removal of selected trace elements by phases co-precipitating with clinopyroxene and amphibole (especially magnetite, fluorapatite, phlogopite and pyrochlore). With the exception of magnesiohastingsite–richterite sample from Afrikanda, the invariability of trace-element ratios in the majority of zoned clinopyroxene and amphibole crystals implies that fluids are not involved in the development of zoning in these minerals. The implications of the new trace-element data for mineral exploration targeting REE, Nb and other types of carbonatite-hosted rare-metal mineralization are discussed.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Cenozoic Upper Rhine Graben was controlled by a repeatedly changing stress field and the reactivation of a complex set of crustal discontinuities that had come into evidence during Permo-Carboniferous times. A comparison of the spatial and temporal thickness distribution of synrift deposits with preexisting fault patterns permits to infer a sequence of distinct basin subsidence phases that can be related to changes in the ambient stress field. Reactivation of a system of late Palaeozoic fault systems, outlining troughs and highs, controlled the nucleation of initially separated middle and late Eocene basins, the depocenters of which coincided with a preexisting WSW-ENE trend. During Oligocene crustal extension the individual basins coalesced, resulting in the development of the SSW-NNE striking Upper Rhine Graben. During the late Oligocene (Chattian) change in stress field, the Upper Rhine Graben was probably reactivated as a dextral strike-slip system with the central graben segment forming a releasing bend. During the early Miocene (Aquitanian), a major reorientation of the regional stress field is held responsible for the main subsidence phase of the northern parts of the Upper Rhine Graben. This is reflected by a counterclockwise rotation and northeastward shift of the depocenter axis and later by the middle Miocene uplift and erosion of the southern parts of the Upper Rhine Graben. During the Plio-Quaternary, the Upper Rhine Graben was reactivated as a sinistral strike-slip system with the central graben segment forming a restraining bend.},

abstract = {Peridotites exhumed in the footwall of axial detachment faults at slow-spreading ridges are highly serpentinized. Most mid-ocean ridge detachment settings are magmatically active and hydrous fluid circulation in and near the fault has been shown to be influenced by the presence of melt or magmatic lithologies. Our working area along the Southwest Indian Ridge (62–65°E) is nearly amagmatic and represents an end-member to study the hydrous alteration of exhumed peridotites without these magmatic influences. We use an integrated petrological approach combining microstructural, mineralogical and chemical observations to unravel the sequence of serpentinization in 272 dredged samples of variably serpentinized peridotites and to document the circulation of serpentinizing fluids in and near the exhumation faults. We find that serpentine recrystallization and veins overprint the initial serpentinite mesh texture in ∼25{\%} of the samples. Oxygen isotope data suggest that this sequence developed at relatively high temperatures (271–336°C) and under increasing fluid–rock ratios, from near stoichiometry for mesh texture formation to {\textgreater}10 during recrystallization. Increasing fluid supersaturation relative to serpentine favors the replacement of mesh texture lizardite by chrysotile and polygonal or polyhedral serpentine. We attribute local recrystallization into antigorite to moderate Si-metasomatism, possibly following pyroxene serpentinization. We do not observe the more pronounced Si-metasomatism leading to talc replacing serpentine that is reported for the more magmatically active Mid-Atlantic Ridge detachment settings and is attributed to prior leaching of magmatic rocks. Scales of preferential fluid pathways in our samples evolved from pervasive and close-spaced ({\textless}500 µm) microfractures during the formation of the initial serpentine mesh texture, to centimeter-thick planar domains of enhanced fluid flux, spaced at ∼10 cm intervals and probably grouped in corridors that may be up to ∼100 m across. Serpentine minerals are enriched in some fluid-mobile elements (Cl, B, U) relative to the peridotite protolith, and several elements (Al, Fe, Si, Cu, As, Sb, REE) are redistributed at the millimeter to decimeter scale. Serpentinizing fluids were seawater-derived, probably mildly alkaline (small to no europium anomalies), reducing and H2-enriched (formation of magnetite). These fluids may have been similar to, though warmer than, those venting at the ultramafic-hosted Lost City hydrothermal fluid (30°N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge).},

abstract = {Trace element partition coefficients between clinopyroxenes and associated glassy matrix (Cpx/L D) have been determined for 13 REE, HFSE4+,5+, U, Th, Sr, Pb, Sc and V from combined LA-ICP-MS/EMP analyses in selected trachytes and trachyphonolites from Campi Flegrei. Composition of clinopyroxene and glass is pretty homogeneous in the trachyphonolites, pointing to an overall attainment of the equilibrium conditions. In trachytes, conversely, phases show some compositional heterogeneity (due to the presence of clinopyroxene xenocrysts) that requested a more careful petrographic and geochemical inspection of the samples to assess the equilibrium clinopyroxene composition. In the trachyte clinopyroxenes, REE are compatible from Nd to Lu (Cpx/L D up to 2.9), like Y, Ti, Sc and V. The Cpx/L D for Eu is lower than those of the adjacent REE, highlighting Eu2+ contribution. High D values are also shown by U, Th, Pb, Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta relatively to basaltic and andesitic systems, whereas the D Sr is roughly similar to that found for less evolved magmas. Trachyphonolites are characterized by an overall decrease of the Cpx/L D for highly-charged cations (with the exception of V), and by a slight increase of D Sr. REE are still compatible from Nd to Lu (Cpx/L D up to 2.1), like Ti, Y, Sc and V. This variation is also predicted for REE and Y by models based on the elastic strain theory, being consistent with the slightly lower polymerization degree estimated for the trachyphonolites. However, the observed Cpx/L D (REE,Y) are matched by the modelled ones only considering very low T (≤825°C), which are believed unlikely. This mismatch cannot be attributed to effects induced by the water-rich composition of the trachyte–trachyphonolite suite, since they would lower the observed Cpx/L D (REE,Y). Moreover, the anomalous inflections of measured Cpx/L D for HREE suggests some crystal-chemical control, such as the entrance of these elements in a site distinct from M2. It is concluded that the large Cpx/L D determined for trachytes and trachyphonolites are likely induced by hitherto unconstrained changes of the Z3+ activities related to the composition of melt and/or solid. All these considerations strongly highlight the importance of a direct characterization of trace element partitioning in natural samples from magmatic systems poorly characterized by experimental studies.},

abstract = {We report major and trace element abundances for 147 samples and Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb isotope compositions for a 36 sample subset of basaltic lava flows, sills, and dykes from the Karoo continental flood basalt (CFB) province in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and northern South Africa. Both low- and high-Ti (TiO2 {\textless} 2 wt {\%} and {\textgreater} 2 wt {\%}) rocks are included. MELTS modeling shows that these magmas evolved at low pressure (1 kbar) through fractional crystallization of gabbroic assemblages. Whereas both groups display enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) relative to heavy REE (HREE) and high field strength elements, and systematic negative Nb anomalies, they differ in terms of contrasting middle REE (MREE) to HREE fractionation, which is greater for the high-Ti basalts. This reflects different depths of melting of slightly enriched mantle sources: calculations suggest that the low-Ti basalts were generated by melting of a shallow spinel-bearing (2 {\%} spinel) lherzolite, whereas the high-Ti magmas originated from a deeper-seated garnet-bearing (2–7{\%} garnet) lherzolite. In most isotope plots, the high-Ti lavas together with the picrites define a common trend from Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) to compositions with strongly negative ɛNdi and ɛHfi akin to those of some nephelinites and lamproites. The low-Ti rocks are shifted from BSE-like to more radiogenic Sr isotope ratios, indicative of upper crustal contamination. Trace element and isotope characteristics of the Karoo magmas require a combination of enrichment processes (subduction induced?) and long-term isolation of the mantle sources. We propose two distinct scenarios to explain the origin of the Karoo province. The first calls for polybaric melting of spatially heterogeneous, partially veined, sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Calculations show that mixing between SCLM (∼BSE) and a strongly Nd–Hf unradiogenic nephelinite-like component (sediment input?) could account for the compositional variations of most of the high-Ti group lavas, whereas the mantle composition responsible for the low-Ti magmas is more likely to be similar to a vein-free, metasomatically enriched SCLM component. The second scenario involves mixing between two end-members represented by the SCLM and its deep-seated alkalic veins and a sub-lithospheric (asthenospheric- or ocean island basalt-like?) mantle plume. In this case, the data are compatible with an increasing mantle plume contribution as the plume rises and expands through the lithosphere. Regardless of which of the two scenarios is invoked, the spatial distribution of the low- and high-Ti magmas matches the relative positioning of the cratons and the Limpopo belt in such a way that strong control of the lithosphere on magma composition and distribution is a mandatory requirement of any petrogenetic model applied to the Karoo CFB.},

abstract = {Our current lack of understanding of the partitioning behavior of Sc, Y and the REE (rare-earth elements) can be attributed directly to the lack of a sufficiently large or chemically diverse experimental data set. To address this problem, we conducted a series of experiments using several different natural composition lavas, doped with the elements of interest, as starting compositions. Microprobe analyses of orthopyroxene, pigeonite, olivine, magnetite, ilmenite and co-existing glasses in the experimental charges were used to calculate expressions that describe REE partitioning as a function of a variety of system parameters. Using expressions that represent mineral-melt reactions (versus element ratio distribution coefficients) it is possible to calculate terms that express low-Ca pyroxene-melt partitioning behavior and are independent of both pyroxene and melt composition. Compositional variations suggest that Sc substitution in olivine involves either a paired substitution with Al or, more commonly, with vacancies. The partitioning of Sc is dependent both on melt composition and temperature. Our experimentally determined olivine-melt REE Ds (partition coefficients) are similar to, but slightly higher than those reported by McKay (1986) and support their conclusions that olivines are strongly LREE depleted. Y and REE mineral/melt partition coefficients for magnetite range from 0.003 for La to 0.02 for Lu. Ilmenite partition coefficients range from 0.007 for La to 0.029 for Lu. These experimental values are two orders of magnitude lower than many of the published values determined by phenocryst/matrix separation techniques.},

The low-temperature Nikos peridotites ({\textless} 1100°C), which represent the shallow Somerset lithosphere, are characterized by higher 176Lu/177Hf ratios (0.03-0.05) and Hf isotopic values (176Hf/177Hf(0.1Ga) = 0.28296-0.28419) than the deep-seated high-temperature peridotites ({\textgreater}1100°C; 0.004-0.03, 0.28265-0.28333, respectively). These differences in Hf isotope signatures suggest that shallow and deep subcontinental lithosphere beneath Somerset Island represent isotopically distinct domains and do not share a common petrogenetic history. The Lu-Hf isotope systematics of the shallow low-temperature peridotites define a positively sloped line that plot along a 2.8 Ga reference isochron. A number of these peridotites are characterized by highly radiogenic Hf isotopic compositions suggestive of long-term radiogenic ingrowth (billions of years). These findings are consistent with an interpretation that the shallow Somerset lithosphere (to depths of ∼ 150 km) stabilized in the Archean. The majority of the high-temperature peridotites plot closer to the composition of the host kimberlite. Although the observed isotopic variation may be attributed in part to kimberlite-related Hf addition, it is possible that these deep-seated xenoliths represent younger mantle. The superchondritic 176Lu/177Hf ratios observed for a number of the shallow low-temperature peridotites indicate strong fractionation of Lu and Hf, suggesting mantle root formation in the garnet stability field (depths {\textgreater} 80 km). The Hf isotope compositions for the Somerset low-temperature peridotites indicate that part of the mantle root beneath the North American craton is characterized by a more radiogenic Hf isotope signature than that estimated for a typical 'depleted' mantle. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We investigated experimentally trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and anhydrous silicate melt at conditions relevant to near-solidus melting of quartz eclogite in the upper mantle. Partitioning experiments were carried out at 3.0 GPa and 1335-1365 oC on a synthetic mixture similar to a low-degree melt of a quartz eclogite. Clinopyroxene is Al2O3-rich ({\~{}}17 wt{\%}), cation deficient ({\~{}}3.92 cations per six O atoms), and coexists with andesitic melt ({\~{}}57 wt{\%} SiO2), quartz, and traces of rutile. The clinopyroxene cation deficiency indicates a large proportion of vacant M2 sites in form of the Ca-Eskola (CaEs) component (Ca0.5-¡0.5AlSi2O6). Clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients (D-values) were determined for Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, REE, Th, and U by SIMS, and for Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, K, and major elements by electron microprobe analysis. Compared to previous studies of clinopyroxene with {\textgreater}10 wt{\%} Al2O3, partition coefficients in vacancy-rich aluminous clinopyroxene for elements substituting into the M2 site are elevated for monovalent cations (DNa {\~{}} 1.0, DK = 0.027), and reduced for trivalent cations, particularly for LREE (DLa = 0.029). DTh and DU range from 0.0017 to 0.0037, much lower than previously assumed for clinopyroxene pertaining to partial melting of eclogite in the upper mantle, and DU/DTh is apparently {\textgreater}1. Observed partitioning behavior of elements substituting into M2 is attributable to the low average charge (1.53- 1.57) of the site. This low average charge increases the number of configurations available to charge balance 1+ cations and vacancies, and decreases the number of configurations available to charge balance cations with high valences. Stablization of low-valence species suggests that these vacancyrich clinopyroxenes may be substantial hosts of noble gases in the mantle. Partition coefficients for cations substituting into the M1 site show relatively little effect from the high vacancy concentrations of M2, but partitioning systematics may be obscured by strong crystal field stabilization of some cations in the M1 site, notably Ni2+ and Cr3+. Application of the measured D-values of this study to partial-melting calculations results in small increases in the Sm/Yb of liquids produced by modest extents of melting of quartz eclogite. Significant enrichments in (230Th)/(238U) activity ratios ({\textgreater}1.21) are expected for decompression melting of quartz eclogite at upwelling rates below 5 cm/ year, but enrichments would be small ({\textless}1.11) above 10 cm/year.},

abstract = {The Teide and Pico Viejo stratocones and the Northwest and Northeast Rifts are products of the latest eruptive phase of the island of Tenerife, initiated with the lateral collapse of its northern flank that formed the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera and the Icod–La Guancha Valley ca. 200 ka. The eruptive and structural evolution of this volcanic complex has been reconstructed after detailed geological mapping and radioisotopic dating of the significant eruptive events. A set of 54 new 14C and K/Ar ages provides precise age control of the recent eruptive history of Tenerife, particularly Teide Volcano, the third-highest volcanic feature on Earth (3718 m above sea level, {\textgreater}7 km high), and unique in terms of its intraplate setting. The development of the Teide–Pico Viejo Volcanoes may be related to the activity of the Northwest and Northeast Rifts. Volcanic and intrusive activity along both rift zones may have played an important role in activating the gravitational landslide and in the subsequent growth, nested within the collapse embayment, of an increasingly higher central volcano with progressively differentiated magmas. The coeval growth of the central volcano with sustained activity along the rifts led to a clear bimodal distribution in composition of eruptive products, with the basaltic eruptions in the distal part of the rifts and phonolitic and more explosive eruptions in the central area, where the differentiated stratocones developed. Current volcanic hazard in Tenerife is considered to be moderate, because eruptive frequency is low, explosivity is modest, and the eruptive activity of the Teide stratocone seems to have declined over the past 30 k.y., with only one eruption in this period (1150 yr B.P.).},

abstract = {Although general accounts of carbonatites usually envisage Ca-Mg carbonate melts evolving by fractional crystallisation to Fe-rich residua, there is longstanding concern that ferrocarbonatites may actually be products of hydrothermal rather than magmatic processes. All previously published examples of ankerite- and/or siderite-carbonatites fail to show one or more of the isotopic criteria (all determined on the same sample) thought to be diagnostic of crystallised magmatic carbonate liquids. Ferrocarbonatite dykes cut Archaean-Proterozoic basement at Swartbooisdrif, adjacent to the NW Namibia-Angola border. Their age is uncertain but probably {\~{}}1,100 Ma and their associated fenites are rich in sodalite. Where unaffected by subsequent recrystallisation, their petrographic textures resemble those of silicate layered intrusions; ankerite, magnetite and occasionally calcite are cumulus phases, joined by trace amounts of intercumulus pyrochlore. Ankerite is zoned, from Ca(Mg, Fe2+)(CO3)2 cores towards ferroan dolomite rims. Calcite contains {\~{}}1.7{\%} SrO, plus abundant, tiny exsolved strontianite grains. Magnetite is close to pure Fe3O4. Pyrochlore has fine-scale euhedral oscillatory zoning and light-REE-enriched rims. ICP-MS analysis of magnetite and pyrochlore from the carbonatite allows calculation of their modal amounts from mass-balance considerations. Sodalite from the fenite is REE poor. Geothermometry, using either the calcite-dolomite solvus or oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite and magnetite, gives temperatures in the range 420-460 °C. Initial Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios of the ferrocarbonatites (87Sr/86Sr=0.7033; )Nd=0.2-1.0; 206Pb/204Pb=16.37; 207Pb/204Pb=15.42; 208Pb/204Pb=36.01) are appropriate for an {\~{}}1,100-Ma magmatic carbonatite. Likewise, carbonate '18O=8.0 and '13C=-7.36 indicate little or no subsequent shift from magmatic values. It appears that dense ankerite and magnetite dominated crystal accumulation from a melt saturated in these phases, plus calcite and pyrochlore, with prior fractionation of a silicate mineral and apatite. The resulting ferrocarbonatite lacks a silicate mineral (excluding fenite xenocrysts) and apatite. It has unusually low (basalt-like) REE abundances and (La/Lu)n, and low concentrations of Ba, Rb, U, Th, Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf. Very high Nb/Ta and low Zr/Hf imply that the evolution of the parental magma involved immiscible separation of a carbonate from a silicate melt. The sodalite-dominated Swartbooisdrif fenites suggest that the parental melt also had a substantial Na content, in contrast with the ferrocarbonatite rock.},

abstract = {Detailed geochemical and field data for the volcanic sequence and intrusions of the Etendeka Igneous Province are used to construct a stratigraphic framework for petrogenetic interpretation of the evolution of the Etendeka-Parana continental flood volcanic event. Geochemical and petrographic characterization of over 1,000 analyzed samples allows 8 mafic and 17 silicic magma types to be recognized. Both silicic and mafic types can be grouped into high-Ti and low-Ti suites on the basis of elevated Ti relative to other elements. The mafic magmas are: Khumib (high-Ti), Tafelberg, Kuidas, Horingbaai, Huab, Tafelkop, Albin, and Esmeralda (all low-Ti). Amongst the silicic types, the Goboboseb, Springbok, Wereldsend, Grootberg, and Beacon low-Ti quartz latites, and the Nil Desperandum high-Ti latite have been described previously. In addition, the Hoas (low-Ti), Nadas, Sechomib, and Hoarusib, (all high-Ti) latites and the Fria (low-Ti), Sarusas, Ventura, Khoraseb, Naude, and Elliott (all high-Ti) quartz latites are described for the first time here. There is a marked provinciality in the distribution of the high- and low-Ti suites, with the former concentrated in the Northern Etendeka region and the latter dominant in the Southern Etendeka. Stratigraphic distribution of magma types allows two new formations to be defined in the Northern Etendeka - the Khumib Formation of basaltic flows and the Skeleton Coast Formation dominated by silicic sheets. The geochemical provinciality hampers precise correlations between Northern and Southern Etendeka. Available evidence suggests that the lower part of the Awahab Formation in the Southern Etendeka is coeval with the lower part of the Khumib Formation and that the silicic units in the upper part of the Tafelberg Formation probably correlate with the Skeleton Coast Formation. The paucity of Khumib dykes in relation to Tafelberg dykes and their field relationships with regard to the volcanic sequence in the Northern Etendeka suggests that the main Khumib eruptive centers lay further north, consistent with southward thinning of the Khumib basalts. In the Southern Etendeka, the Doros complex is the eruptive center of the plume-derived Tafelkop basalts, which probably built a shield volcano within the regional flood lava field. This work indicates that the Etendeka has a greater variety of both silicic and low-Ti mafic magma types than are known from the SE Parana. Detailed comparisons reveal that all the important silicic types in the Parana have geochemical equivalents in the Etendeka. New correlations are Santa Maria=Fria, Ourinhos=Khoraseb, Guarapuava=Sarusas, thus extending the previously recognized correlations between Southern Etendeka quartz latites and the Caixas do Sul and Anita Garibaldi "rhyolites." These correlations emphasize that very large volume silicic systems develop with pronounced lithospheric rifting in continental flood basalt provinces.},

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica, is an active, intraplate, alkaline volcano. The strongly undersaturated sodic lavas range from basanite to anorthoclase phonolite, and are termed the Erebus lineage (EL). The lavas are porphyritic with olivine (Fo88–51), clinopyroxene (Wo45–53En36–41Fs8–30), opaque oxides (Usp31–76), feldspar (An72–11), and apatite. Rare earth element (REE) contents increase only slightly with increasing differentiation compared with other incompatible elements. The light REE are enriched (LaN/YbN= 14–20) and there are no significant Eu anomalies. 87Sr/86Sr is uniform and low (˜ 0.7030) throughout the EL, suggesting derivation of the basanites from a depleted asthenospheric mantle source, and lack of significant crustal contamination during fractionation of the basanite. Regular geochemical trends indicate that the EL evolved from the basanites by fractional crystallization. Major element mass balance calculations and trace element models show that fractionation of 16{\%} olivine, 52{\%} clinopyroxene, 14{\%} Fe-Ti oxides, 11{\%} feldspar, 3{\%} nepheline, and 3{\%} apatite from a basanite parent leaves 23.5{\%} anorthoclase phonolite.Minor volumes of less undersaturated, more iron-rich benmoreite, phonolite, and trachyte are termed the enriched iron series (EFS). The trachytes have 87Sr/86Sr of 0.704, higher than other EFS and EL rocks, and they probably evolved by a combined assimilation-fractional crystallization process.The large volume of phonolite at Mt. Erebus requires significant basanite production. This occurs by low degrees of partial melting in a mantle plume (here termed the Erebus plume) rising at a rate of about 6 cm/yr. },

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Antarctica, is a large (3794 m) alkaline open-conduit stratovolcano that hosts a vigorously convecting and persistently degassing lake of anorthoclase phonolite magma. The composition of the lake was investigated by analyzing glass and mineral compositions in lava bombs erupted between 1972 and 2004. Matrix glass, titanomagnetite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and fluor-apatite compositions are invariant and show that the magmatic temperature (∼ 1000°C) and oxygen fugacity ($\Delta$logFMQ = - 0.9) have been stable. Large temperature variations at the lake surface ({\~{}} 400-500°C) are not reflected in mineral compositions. Anorthoclase phenocrysts up to 10 cm in length feature a restricted compositional range (An10.3-22.9Ab62.8-68.1Or11.4-27.2) with complex textural and compositional zoning. Anorthoclase textures and compositions indicate crystallization occurs at low degrees of effective undercooling. We propose shallow water exsolution causes crystallization and shallow convection cycles the anorthoclase crystals through many episodes of growth resulting in their exceptional size. Minor variations in eruptive activity from 1972 to 2004 are decoupled from magma compositions. The variations probably relate to changes in conduit geometry within the volcano and/or variable input of CO2-rich volatiles into the upper-level magma chamber from deeper in the system. Eleven bulk samples of phonolite lava from the summit plateau that range in age from 0 ± 4 ka to 17 ± 8 ka were analyzed for major and trace elements. Small compositional variations are controlled by anorthoclase content. The lavas are indistinguishable from modern bulk lava bomb compositions and demonstrate that Erebus volcano has been erupting lava and tephra from the summit region with the same bulk composition for ∼ 17 ka. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The late Pleistocene caldera complex of the Sierra La Primavera, Jalisco, M{\'{e}}xico, contains well-exposed lava flows and domes, ash-flow tuff, air-fall pumice, and caldera-lake sediments. All eruptive units are high-silica rhyolites, but systematic chemical differences correlate with age and eruptive mode. The caldera-producing unit, the 45-km3 Tala Tuff, is zoned from a mildly peralkaline first-erupted portion enriched in Na, Rb, Cs, Cl, F, Zn, Y, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, Sb, HREE, Pb, Th, and U to a metaluminous last-erupted part enriched in K, LREE, Sc, and Ti; Al, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, and Eu are constant within analytical errors. The earliest post-caldera lava, the south-central dome, is nearly identical to the last-erupted portion of the Tala Tuff, whereas the slightly younger north-central dome is chemically transitional from the south-central dome to later, moremafic, ring domes. This sequence of ash-flow tuff and domes represents the tapping of progressively deeper levels of a zoned magma chamber 95,000 ± 5,000 years ago. Since that time, the lavas that erupted 75,000, 60,000, and 30,000 years ago have become decreasingly peralkaline and progressively enriched only in Si, Rb, Cs, and possibly U. They represent successive eruption of the uppermost magma in the post-95,000-year magma chamber. Eruptive units of La Primavera are either aphyric or contain up to 15{\%} phenocrysts of sodic sanidine ≧quartz {\textgreater}ferrohedenbergite {\textgreater}fayalite{\textgreater}ilmenite±titanomagnetite. Whereas major-element compositions of sanidine, clinopyroxene, and fayalite phenocrysts changed only slightly between eruptive groups, concentrations of many trace elements changed by factors of 5 to 10, resulting in crystal/glass partition coefficients that differ by factors of up to 20 between successively erupted units. The extreme variations in partitioning behavior are attributed to small changes in bulk composition of the melt because major-element compositions of the phenocrysts and temperature, pressure, and oxygen fugacity of the magma all remained essentially constant. Crystal settling and incremental partial melting by themselves appear incapable of producing either the chemical gradients within the Tala Tuff magma chamber or the trends with time in the post-caldera lavas. Transport of trace metals as volatile complexes within the thermal and gravitational gradient in volatilerich but water-undersaturated magma is considered the dominant process responsible for compositional zonation in the Tala Tuff. The evolution of the post-caldera lavas with time is thought to involve the diffusive emigration of trace elements from a relatively dry magma as a decreasing proportion of network modifiers and/or a decreasing concentration of complexing ligands progressively reduced trace-metal-site availability in the silicate melt.},

abstract = {Magma flow during volcanic eruptions causes surface deformation that can be used to constrain the location, geometry and internal pressure evolution of the underlying magmatic source. The height of the volcanic plumes during explosive eruptions also varies with magma flow rate, in a nonlinear way. In May 2011, an explosive eruption at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn Volcano, Iceland, erupted about 0.27 km3 dense-rock equivalent of basaltic magma in an eruption plume that was about 20 km high. Here we use Global Positioning System (GPS) and tilt data, measured before and during the eruption at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn Volcano, to show that the rate of pressure change in an underlying magma chamber correlates with the height of the volcanic plume over the course of the eruption. We interpret ground deformation of the volcano, measured by geodesy, to result from a pressure drop within a magma chamber at about 1.7 km depth. We estimate the rate of magma discharge and the associated evolution of the plume height by differentiating the co-eruptive pressure drop with time. The time from the initiation of the pressure drop to the onset of the eruption was about 60 min, with about 25{\%} of the total pressure change preceding the eruption. Near-real-time geodetic observations can thus be useful for both timely eruption warnings and for constraining the evolution of volcanic plumes.},

abstract = {The Bayan Obo deposit in Inner Mongolia, North China Craton (NCC) is the largest rare-earth element (REE) resource in the world. Due to the complex element and mineral compositions and the activity of several geological events, the ore-forming mechanism is still controversial. Previous models are reviewed here to provide information for further investigation on the Bayan Obo deposit. In this study, we summarize all different types of Fe-REE-Nb mineralization using field observations and microscope work, in which we recognize 9 types of Fe-REE-Nb ores in the Bayan Obo ore district. By compiling and re-evaluating a large number of published geochemical data, this paper provides solid evidence that the Bayan Obo deposit formed through interaction between sedimentary rocks and carbonatite magmatism. From the results of our review, it can be conjectured that the formation of iron ores was originated from sedimentation (Pt1), whereas the formation of REE mineralized dolomite might be related to interaction and reaction between the carbonatite magmas and/or associated fluids with sedimentary carbonate rocks, with the REE-bearing carbonatite magmas having undergone intense fractionation enrichment process. The C-O-S-Fe-Mg isotopes indicate that the REE-Nb mineralization was derived from metasomatism (fenitic alteration) of sedimentary carbonate. A new model is proposed for this unique REE-Nb mineralization, which is related to the subduction of Siberian Craton beneath the North China Craton since Early Paleozoic period. We interpret that the Bayan Obo Fe-REE-Nb ore deposits and their massive barren host, H8 dolomite, were generated as a result of interaction of fluids expelled from a subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM)-derived carbonatite magma with sedimentary carbonates.},

abstract = {Re-examination of textural and structural features of the Skaergaard Intrusion has clarified the process responsible for various forms of layering. Two general types are distinguished, one produced by magmatic flow and another by non-dynamic processes, such as compaction and varied nucleation and growth of crystals. Our concern here is mainly with layering of the first type. Magmatic flow results in contrasting layers and strong foliation accompanied by a linear orientation of elongated minerals. It is associated with slumping and cross-bedding in a zone near the margins of the intrusion. Rocks in the interior of the Layered Series are foliated and commonly layered but have little or no lineation; their layering cannot be due solely to deposition from currents. The principal structural elements produced by dynamic processes in the magmatic state—foliation, lineation, shear zones, folds, and current structures—define parallel belts, mainly around the western and northern margins. Their distribution suggests that the strongest component of flow was for the western side and that its strength decreased toward the east. Shear flow trajectories deduced from lineations and kinematic indicators confirm this asymmetry and point to mass movement toward the southeastern part of the floor.},

abstract = {Near-primitive picritic basalts in the northwestern Deccan Traps have MgO{\textgreater}10 wt.{\%} and consist of two groups (low-Ti and high-Ti) with markedly different incompatible element and Nd–Sr–Pb isotope characteristics. Many elemental characteristics of the low-Ti picritic basalts are similar to those of transitional or normal ocean ridge basalts. However, values of ratios like Ba/Nb (13–30) and Ce/Pb (4–11), and isotopic ratios (e.g., $\epsilon$Nd(t) +0.3 to −6.3, (207Pb/204Pb)t 15.63–15.75 at (206Pb/204Pb)t 18.19–18.84, $\delta$18Oolivine as high as +6.2‰) are far-removed from ocean-ridge-type values, indicating a significant contribution from continental crust. The crustal signature could represent crustal contamination of ascending magmas; alternatively, it could represent a minor component within the Indian lithospheric mantle of anciently subducted sedimentary material or fluids derived from subducted material. In contrast, the high-Ti picritic basalts are chemically and isotopically rather similar to recent shield lavas of the R{\'{e}}union hotspot (e.g., $\epsilon$Nd(t) +2 to +4) and to volcanic rocks along the postulated pre-Deccan track of this hotspot in Pakistan. Neither type of picritic basalt is parental to the voluminous flows comprising the bulk of the Deccan Traps. However, many of the Deccan primary magmas could have been derived from mixtures of a high-Ti-type, R{\'{e}}union-like source component and a component more similar to, or even more incompatible-element-depleted than, average ocean-ridge mantle.},

abstract = {We present the variation in trace element partition coefficients measured at the interface between rapidly cooled clinopyroxene crystals and co-existing melts. Results indicate that, as the cooling rate is increased, clinopyroxene crystals are progressively depleted in Si, Ca and Mg counterbalanced by enrichments in Al (mainly tetrahedral Aliv), Na and Ti. Partition coefficients (Ds) for rare earth elements (REE), high field strength elements (HFSE) and transition elements (TE) increase with increasing cooling rate, in response to clinopyroxene compositional variations. The entry of REE into the M2 site is facilitated by a coupled substitution where either Na substitutes for Ca on the M2 site or Aliv substitutes for Si in the tetrahedral site. The latter substitution reflects an increased ease of locally balancing the excess charge at M2 as the number of surrounding Aliv atoms increases. Due to the lower concentration of Ca in rapidly cooled clinopyroxenes, divalent large ion lithophile elements (LILE) on M2 decrease at the expense of monovalent cations. Conversely, higher concentrations of HFSE and TE on the M1 site are facilitated as the average charge on this site increases with the replacement of divalent-charged cations by Alvi. Although crystallization kinetics modify clinopyroxene composition, deviations from equilibrium partitioning are insufficient to change the tendency of a trace element to be compatible or incompatible. Consequently, there are regular relationships between ionic radius, valence of the trace element and D. At both equilibrium and cooling rate conditions, Ds for isovalent cations define parabola-like curves when plotted against ionic radius, consistent with the lattice strain model, demonstrating that the partitioning of trace elements is driven by charge balance mechanisms; cation substitution reactions can be treated in terms of the energetics of the various charge-imbalanced configurations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {The Cenozoic Mianning–Dechang (MD) rare earth element (REE) belt in eastern Tibet is an important source of light REE in southwest China. The belt is 270 km long and 15 km wide. The total REE resources are {\textgreater}3 Mt of light rare earth oxides (REO), including 3.17 Mt of REO at Maoniuping (average grade = 2.95 wt.{\%}), 81,556 t at Dalucao (average grade = 5.21 wt.{\%}), 0.1 Mt at Muluozhai (average grade = 3.97 wt.{\%}), and 5764 t of REO at Lizhuang (average grade = 2.38 wt.{\%}). Recent results from detailed geological surveys, and studies of petrographic features, ore-forming ages, ore forming conditions, and wallrock alteration are synthesized in this paper. REE mineralization within this belt is associated with carbonatite–syenite complexes, with syenites occurring as stocks intruded by carbonatitic sills or dikes. The mineralization is present as complex vein systems that contain veinlet, stringer, stockwork, and brecciated pipe type mineralization. Carbonatites in these carbonatite-related REE deposits (CARDs) are extremely rich in light REEs, Sr ({\textgreater}5000 ppm), and Ba ({\textgreater}1000 ppm), and have low Sr/Ba and high Ba/Th ratios, and radiogenic Sr–Nd isotopic compositions. These fertile magmas, which may lead to the formation of REE deposits, were generated by the partial melting of sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) that was metasomatized by REE- and CO2-rich fluids derived from subducted marine sediments. We suggest that this refertilization occurred along cratonic margins and, in particular, at a convergent margin where small-volume carbonatitic melts ascended along trans-lithospheric faults and transported REEs into the overlying crust, leading to the formation of the CARDs. The formation of fertile carbonatites requires a thick lithosphere and/or high pressures ({\textgreater}25 kbar), a metasomatized and enriched mantle source, and favorable pathways for magma to ascend into the overlying crust where REE-rich fluids exsolve from cooling magma. The optimal combination of these three factors only occurs along the margins of a craton with a continental root, rather than in modern subduction zones where the lithosphere is relatively thin. U–Pb zircon dating indicates that the Maoniuping, Lizhuang, and Muluozhai alkali igneous complexes in the northern part of the belt formed at 27–22 Ma, whereas the Dalucao complex in the southern part of the belt formed at 12–11 Ma. Biotite and arfvedsonite in Lizhuang and Maoniuping REE deposit have40Ar/39Ar ages of 30.8 ± 0.4 Ma (MSWD = 0.98) and 27.6 ± 2.0 Ma (MSWD = 0.06), respectively. Biotitaion alteration in syenite and fenitization caused by the relatively amount of carbonatite on syenite and host rocks is the main alteration along the whole belt. Initial Sr (0.7059–0.7079),143Nd/144Nd (0.5123–0.5127), and207Pb/204Pb (15.601–15.628) and208Pb/204Pb (38.422–38.604) isotopic compositions of fluorite, barite, celestite, and calcite in the MD belt are similar to those of the associated syenite and carbonatite. Given the relatively high contents of Cl, F, SO42−, and CO2in the rocks of the complexes, it is likely that the REEs were transported by these ligands within hydrothermal fluids, and the presence of bastn{\"{a}}site indicates that the REEs were precipitated as fluorocarbonates. Petrographic, fluid inclusion, and field studies of the ores indicate that bastn{\"{a}}site and other REE minerals formed during the final stages ({\textless}300 °C) of the evolution of magmatic–hydrothermal systems in the belt. The mineralization formed from magmatic and meteoric fluids containing CO2derived from the decarbonation of carbonatite, as indicated by C–O isotopic values of hydrothermal calcite and bastn{\"{a}}site ($\delta$13C = −4.8 to −8.7 and $\delta$18O = 5.8 to 12.5‰) and O–H isotopic values of quartz (330 °C) and arfvedsonite (260 °C), which correspond to fluid isotope compositions of $\delta$18O = 0.3–9.8‰ and $\delta$D = −70.0 to −152.8‰ in the belt. This study indicates that formation the largest REE deposits are related to voluminous carbonatite–syenite complexes, compositionally similar ore-forming fluids, extensive alteration, multiple stages of REE mineralization, and tectonic setting.},

Boron, F, and perhaps P may form peralkaline Na- and Li-species that promote early saturation in mica + quartz. Activities of F, P, and especially B are largely unbuffered throughout crystallization. Concentration of these components through fractional crystallization involving muscovite generates a peralkaline, Na-aluminosilicate-rich melt or vapor from which albitites rich in tourmaline, phosphates, F-rich micas, beryl, zircon, and Nb-Ta-Sn oxides crystallize.

abstract = {The saturation surfaces of rutile (TiO2), zircon (ZrSiO4), and hafnon (HfSiO4) were determined in anhydrous, peraluminous, high silica liquids of the system SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O as functions of silica concentration at 1,400° C in air. The saturation concentrations of TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 in rutile, zircon, and hafnon-saturated liquids, respectively, decrease smoothly and gradually as functions of increasing silica concentration. Thermodynamic analyses of the data demonstrate that the activity coefficients of TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 increase smoothly and gradually as silica concentration is increased from 67 wt-{\%} to 80 wt-{\%}, and that changes in SiO2 of 1 or 2 wt-{\%} result in small changes in the saturation concentrations and activity coefficients of +4 cations. Because the solution behavior of +4 cations in highly siliceous liquids ({\textgreater}75 wt-{\%} SiO2) is predictably different than in less siliceous liquids (70 to 75 wt-{\%} SiO2), classification of highly-siliceous igneous rocks on the basis of silica concentration alone should not be interpreted to mean that their solution chemistry differs significantly from that of less siliceous rocks. The results of this study are compared with other studies of +4 cation solution behavior. From this it is concluded that variations in liquid compositions observed in cogenetic suites of high silica rhyolites cannot cause the observed changes in +4 cation concentrations. Thus, even if a large change in solution behavior of +4 cations is inferred from the large variations in their concentrations, it cannot be due to changes in bulk composition of the parental liquid. In addition, the similarity in the solution behavior of Zr and Hf seen in this study suggests that their solution mechanisms are similar. It is thus unlikely that liquid-state processes can fractionate one with respect to another, and variations in Zr/Hf ratios in suites of extrusive rocks are likely due to crystal-liquid equilibria, e.g., zircon fractionation.},

abstract = {Radiometric dating by the Ar-40-Ar-39 incremental heating method was carried out on lavas, sills, dykes, and a central intrusion from NE Greenland. Eighteen samples gave acceptable crystallization ages. Lavas of both Lower and Upper Plateau Lava Series gave ages in the range 55.5-53.5 Ma and cannot be constrained to better than 56-53 Ma. Sills and dykes from Traill empty set to Shannon, with compositions fairly similar to those of the lavas, gave ages of 55.1-51.3 Ma, contemporaneous with and slightly younger than the lavas. Alkaline lavas on inland nunataks have ages of 53-50 Ma, and the Kap Broer Ruys intrusive centre has an age of 48.7 +/- 0.5 Ma. An alkaline sill on Hvalroso is much younger at 20.3 +/- 0.1 Ma. There are no pre-breakup lavas onshore NE Greenland. We surmise that the hot mantle of the Iceland plume arrived and melted extensively beneath the northern basins only at the time of breakup around 55 Ma. Post-breakup intrusive events in NE Greenland coincided with plate-tectonic events such as reorganization, uplift and opening in the north. The Hvalroso sill represents a local small melting event that may be related to coeval opening of the Lena Trough.},

abstract = {Li was analysed by activation analysis in 363 whole-rock samples and 53 minerals from a 200 m drill core through aegirine lujavrite I, Il??maussaq intrusion. The rocks are interpreted as cumulates and Li is dominantly located in the intercumulus material which is thought to represent the coexisting magma with 540 ppm: whole-rock contents generally range from 80-260 ppm Li and reflect variations in the amount of intercumulus material from 25-48 wt. {\%}. The proportion of intercumulus material is lowest in the deeper parts of the drill core, in layers with a moderate density stratification resulting from showers of near-liquidus crystals and in compressed cumulates beneath a large naujaite xenolith from the roof. Intercumulus arfvedsonite with an average of 2200 ppm Li contains the bulk of Li in most samples, but nearly every sample contains Li (0-176 ppm) outside the rock-forming minerals (Li-ORFM) which was unlocated by conventional mineral separation. Li-ORFM formed during late-magmatic crystallization (a) from the final residues of intercumulus magma which crystallised as accessory Li-mica and alteration products and (b) during in situ zeolitization of arvedsonite which released Li. A later, more intense zeolitization released Li from the rocks of the drill core. Naujaite xenoliths contain 42-130 ppm Li, except where Li-metasomatised, and are associated with low Li values in adjacent lujavrites. Shearing of consolidated lujavrite allowed mobilization of the Li and its reprecipitation along narrow channels ({\textless} 10 cm). Li is not concentrated in late hydrothermal coatings. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Published by the American Geophysical Union as part of the Geophysical Monograph Series, Volume 100.Continental flood basalts, volcanic passive margins, and oceanic plateaus represent the largest known volcanic episodes on our planet, yet they are not easily explained by plate tectonics. Indeed, some are likely to record periods when the outward transfer of material and energy from the Earth's interior operated in a significantly different mode than at present. In recent years, interest in large-scale mafic magmatism has surged as high-precision geochronological, detailed geochemical, and increasingly sophisticated geophysical data have become available for many provinces. However, the sheer amount of recent material, often in the form of detailed collaborative research projects, can overwhelm newcomers to the field and experts alike as the literature continues to grow dramatically. The need for an up-to-date review volume on a sizable subset of the major continental and oceanic flood basalt provinces, termed large igneous provinces, was recognized by the Commission on Large-Volume Basaltic Provinces (International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior), and the co-editors were charged with organizing and implementing such a volume. We hope that this volume will be valuable to researchers and graduate students worldwide, particularly to petrologists, geochemists, geochronologists, geodynamicists, and plate-tectonics specialists; it may also interest planetologists, oceanographers, and atmospheric scientists.},

abstract = {Magma flow during volcanic eruptions causes surface deformation that can be used to constrain the location, geometry and internal pressure evolution of the underlying magmatic source. The height of the volcanic plumes during explosive eruptions also varies with magma flow rate, in a nonlinear way. In May 2011, an explosive eruption at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn Volcano, Iceland, erupted about 0.27 km3 dense-rock equivalent of basaltic magma in an eruption plume that was about 20 km high. Here we use Global Positioning System (GPS) and tilt data, measured before and during the eruption at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn Volcano, to show that the rate of pressure change in an underlying magma chamber correlates with the height of the volcanic plume over the course of the eruption. We interpret ground deformation of the volcano, measured by geodesy, to result from a pressure drop within a magma chamber at about 1.7 km depth. We estimate the rate of magma discharge and the associated evolution of the plume height by differentiating the co-eruptive pressure drop with time. The time from the initiation of the pressure drop to the onset of the eruption was about 60 min, with about 25{\%} of the total pressure change preceding the eruption. Near-real-time geodetic observations can thus be useful for both timely eruption warnings and for constraining the evolution of volcanic plumes.},

abstract = {The rift-related magmas of the Proterozoic Gardar Igneous Province were emplaced across the contact between the South Greenland Archaean craton and the Palaeoproterozoic Ketilidian mobile belt. It has been suggested that the geochemistry of Gardar intrusive rocks in the two areas varies across the craton margin and that this reflects a lithospheric control. However, comparison of the geochemical and isotopic signatures of basic and ultrabasic dykes from across the area shows that there is no systematic variation related to the age of the country rock. All the Gardar basic rocks are inferred to have been derived from the mantle, with relatively little crustal contamination. We suggest that the lithospheric mantle beneath the Gardar Province was enriched by slab-derived fluids during the Ketilidian orogeny (c. 1800 Ma). Subsequent melting of this mantle source was promoted during Gardar rifting when volatile-rich, small-degree melts from the asthenosphere were introduced into the lithospheric mantle, forming enriched metasomites. Ultrabasic lamprophyre dykes in the Gardar Province represent melts derived largely from these metasomites, whereas basaltic magmas were formed by larger-scale melting of the lithospheric mantle, inheriting a subduction-related signature. There is no evidence that the Gardar magmas were derived from a highly enriched lithospheric keel that had existed since craton formation.},

abstract = {Saw dust obtained from the cutting of EET A79001, a meteorite with a presumed Martian origin, has been analyzed for its carbon content and stable isotopic composition in order to assess the sample's potential value for studies aimed at elucidating Martian surface processes. These fines, which are available in plentiful supply, are a useful source of material and are important since they are a representative whole-rock sample of this complex meteorite. In addition, the fines give an indication of contamination sources which may affect not only the collected sawings but also the sawn surface of the meteorite. A number of contaminants were identified in the fines (e.g. organic materials, Teflon, diamond, and carbon associated with metal). It is considered that the levels of carbon contamination measured represent a worst possible case and hence provide a valuable reference with which to compare other analyses of this sample, or indeed, other Martian meteorites. Evidence was found for an indigenous carbonate component similar to that observed previously in other fractions of the meteorite. However, based on the results presented herein it is not possible to assert that isotopically distinct carbonate minerals of different origins are present in the meteorite. The levels of trapped Martian atmospheric CO2 calculated for the fines are unexpectedly high (∼1 ppm carbon), but this could be influenced by the presence of other, as yet unknown, carbonaceous materials.},

abstract = {Unlike in the ocean basins where the shallow mantle eventually contributes to the destruction of the overlying crust, the shallow mantle beneath continents serves as a stiff, buoyant “root” whose presence may be essential to the long-term survival of continental crust at Earth's surface. These distinct roles for subcrustal mantle come about because the subcontinental mantle consists of a thick section of material left behind after extensive partial melt extraction, possibly from the wedge of mantle overlying a subducting oceanic plate. Melt removal causes the continental mantle to be cold and strong but also buoyant compared to oceanic mantle. These characteristics allow thick sections of cold mantle to persist beneath continental crust in some cases for over 3 billion years. If the continental mantle becomes gravitationally unstable, however, its detachment from the overlying crust can cause major episodes of intracontinental deformation and volcanism.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the effect of increasing melt peralkalinity on partitioning, partition coefficients have been determined using neutron activation analyses of coexisting phenocrysts and glass of five samples from Pantelleria spanning the range trachyte to pantellerite. Alkali feldspar partition coefficients for Fe, Rb, Ba, Sr, and Eu vary with melt peralkalinity due to changes in melt polymerization and to the systematic increase in Xor and decrease in Xan of the feldspar. In going from trachyte to pantellerite, Fe partition coefficients increase from 0.04 to 0.10, presumably because Fe+3 increasingly substitutes in the feldspar tetrahedral site as melt activity of Al declines and Fe concentrations increase. Partition coefficients for trivalent light REEs decrease and the partitioning pattern becomes flatter, the most evolved samples having some of the lowest published values for feldspar. The hundredfold decline in Eu partition coefficients (2.5 to 0.024) and the decrease in the size of the positive partitioning anomaly are attributed to increasing Eu3+/Eu2+ in the melt as it becomes more peralkaline, as well as to concomitant decrease in the Ca content of feldspar. As a result, the behavior of Eu during fractional crystallization of peralkaline suites is fundamentally different from that in metaluminous suites; absolute abundances rise and the size of the negative Eu anomaly changes little with fractionation beyond pantelleritic trachyte. Barium and strontium do not decline to extremely low concentrations in pantellerites, as they do in highly evolved metaluminous rhyolites, because the feldspar partition coefficients drop precipitously with peralkalinity. Similarly, Rb contents do not get large because the partition coefficient increases slightly (0.11 to 0.25) with peralkalinity and is sufficient to make Rb only weakly incompatible in the feldspar-dominated assemblage. Partition coefficients calculated for Sr and Ba from natural phenocryst-matrix pairs can be gross over-estimates in these feldspar-rich felsic rocks if phenocrysts are zoned. This effect is severe for assemblages with bulk distribution coefficients (D) greater than 4 even at very small crystal contents, and for 4 {\textgreater} D {\textgreater} 2 it is significant if crystal contents exceed about 25{\%}. Some of the very high values and much of the variability reported in the literature for Ba and Sr feldspar partition coefficients may be a result of this effect. In contrast to feldspar, partition coefficients for apatite and mafic phases change little with peralkalinity. Partition coefficients for REEs and the compatible elements Sc, Co, and Cr are all less than half those in Fe-rich clinopyroxene and olivine of similar composition in high-silica rhyolite. Although absolute levels of partition coefficients are a function of melt polymerization, the shapes of the REE partitioning patterns appear to be related to the composition of the clinopyroxene. Scandium is most strongly concentrated in clinopyroxene (partition coefficient = 27-60), having larger values in more Fe-rich compositions. Apatite shows a wide range in composition within the suite, the concentrations of Si, Fe, REEs, and Y increasing and Mg, Ca, and P decreasing in more evolved samples. These trends, however, parallel those in coexisting glasses, so that partition coefficients are essentially constant. In peralkaline suites, Cs is the most incompatible of commonly analyzed elements, but its great mobility during alteration and weathering limits its use as a differentiation index. Next in order of incompatibility are Th, U, Hf, Zr, and Ta, which have small, but finite, values of D due to the partitioning of Th and U into apatite ({\~{}}2), the accommodation of Zr and Hf by clinopyroxene ({\~{}}0.4) and titanomagnetite ({\~{}}0.2), and relatively high concentrations of Ta in cossyrite and Fe-Ti oxides. The next most incompatible are the lightest and the heaviest REEs, and, finally, the middle trivalent REEs and Rb. Plots of pairs of relatively incompatible elements form straight-line trends over large compositional ranges in peralkaline suites because the replacement of olivine + titanomagnetite by cossyrite, as the melt becomes more peralkaline, causes little change in D; the REE patterns of titanomagnetite and cossyrite are both approximately flat at values less than 0.1, and the relatively high titanomagnetite partition coefficients for Ta ({\~{}}2), Zr, and Hf, when combined with the very low partition coefficients for these elements for olivine, approximate the moderate partition coefficients for cossyrite. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {In-situ platinum-group element-bearing mineralization of magmatic, hydrothermal and near-surface origin occurs widely in Britain. In addition, grains of platinum-group minerals and other phases that contain platinum-group elements (PGE) have been found in overburden and stream sediments without any identified bedrock source.The Caledonian mafic-ultramafic intrusions of northeast Scotland have been a major target of investigations by the British Geological Survey. Magmatic copper-nickel sulphide deposits, with up to 500 ppb Pt + Pd, have been identified in the Knock intrusion and at Arthrath, near Ellon, in contaminated and xenolithic gabbroic rocks. A magmatic origin, subsequently modified by hydrothermal. reworking at high temperatures in shear zones, is proposed for the mineralization in these areas. PGE enrichments, up to 280 ppb Pt + Pd, also occur in clinopyroxene-bearing ultramafic rocks in deformed mafic-ultramafic intrusions along a major shear zone in the upper Deveron valley near Huntly.At Loch Borralan, on the northwestern margin of the Scottish Caledonides, PGE mineralization, up to 878 ppb Pt + Pd, occurs over a 2-km strike length. Two phases of mineralization are evident: a late magmatic phase comprising base-metal sulphides and rare PGE sulphides; and a later, low-temperature phase with PGE tellurides and antimonides associated with shearing, brittle fracturing and veining. A hydrothermal origin that involved the introduction of As and Sb and the redistribution of early formed sulphides is proposed for this mineralization.High PGE concentrations occur at several strati-graphic levels in the Unst ophiolite, Shetland. Pt and Pd both exceed 100 ppm close to the basal thrust of the ophiolite in a zone of talc-carbonate alteration. Lower-grade Pt-Pd-dominant mineralization has also been reported in the cumulate sequence of the complex. Elsewhere on Unst PGE mineralization more typical of ophiolites, dominated by Os, Ir and Ru, occurs in association with chromitites.Recent studies have identified platinum-group minerals (PGM) in layered ultramafic rocks in the Tertiary igneous centres on Rum, Mull and Skye in northwest Scotland. In each case abundant and diverse PGM assemblages have been recorded and a combined orthomagmatic-hydromagmatic origin has been proposed.In several parts of Britain a gold-PGE association has been identified at the boundary between Permian red-bed basins and underlying reduced strata. Complex Au-Pt-Pd grains and discrete PGM are widespread in drainage sediments and overburden derived from the Lower Devonian and Permo-Triassic rocks in the South Hams area and the Crediton Trough in Devon, and the Mauchline and Thornhill basins in southern Scotland. The genesis of the precious-metal grains is attributed to metal transportation in saline, oxidizing fluids with deposition along faults and in favourable host rocks due to mixing with reduced rocks or fluids.},

abstract = {The Pilanesberg Complex, in South Africa, one of the world's largest alkaline complexes, contains large resources of Zr and the rare-earth elements (REE). Eudialyte is the main carrier of Zr, and contains appreciable concentrations of REE. It is particularly abundant in the green nepheline syenite (20{\%} by volume). It forms complexly zoned poikilitic domains that enclose aegirine, albite, microcline, nepheline, zircon, pectolite, sodalite, and an unidentified Na-Zr silicate. These domains mantle corroded silicates and replace outer zones of microcline euhedra. The eudialyte is partially replaced by fergusonite-(Y) and britholite. Compositionally, the eudialyte at Pilanesberg is unusual, it contains the highest concentration of Nb (up to 3.8 wt{\%} Nb2O5) and the lowest concentrations of Na ({\textless}11.4 wt{\%} Na2O) and Fe ({\textless} 0.4 wt{\%} FeO) reported in the literature. In addition, it has one of thr highest contents of REE (up to 7.6 wt{\%} REE2O3, mainly Ce and La and traces of Sm and Nd) and Mn (up to 7.5 wt{\%}) reported in the literature. On the basis of 78 anions, its formula is (Na12.30REE1.39Ca0.89 K-0.20)(S14.78) (Ca5.42Mn0.58)(S6) (Mn2.96Fe0.04)(S3) (Zr2.66Nb0.28Hf0.06)(S3) (Nb0.66Si0.28 Ta-0.06)(S1) Si-25.64 O-74 (OH1.01Cl0.92F0.07)(S2).2H(2)O. On the basis of textural relationships, the Pilanesberg eudialyte is interpreted to be hydrothermal. It seems to have formed from an orthomagmatic Na-Nb-REE-Cl-F-bearing hydrothermal fluid that exsolved from an agpaitic syenitic magma. In this system, zirconium was probably remobilized from magmatic zircon as a F-complex (e.g., ZrF62-), and REE were introduced as Cl- and F-complexes. The incorporation of the REE in eudialyte probably occurred in response to the reduced Cl- and F-activities that accompanied precipitation of sodalite and the unidentified (F-bearing) Na-Zr silicate.},

abstract = {Three voluminous rhyolitic ignimbrites have been identified along the southern margin of the central Snake River Plain. As a result of wide-scale correlations, new volume estimates can be made for these deposits: {\~{}}350 km3 for the Steer Basin Tuff and Cougar Point Tuff XI, and {\~{}}1,000 km3 for Cougar Point Tuff XIII. These volumes exclude any associated regional ashfalls and correlation across to the north side of the plain, which has yet to be attempted. Each correlation was achieved using a combination of methods including field logging, whole rock and mineral chemistry, magnetic polarity, oxygen isotope signature and high-precision 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. The Steer Basin Tuff, Cougar Point Tuff XI and Cougar Point Tuff XIII have deposit characteristics typical of ‘Snake River (SR)-type' volcanism: they are very dense, intensely welded and rheomorphic, unusually well sorted with scarce pumice and lithic lapilli. These features differ significantly from those of deposits from the better-known younger eruptions of Yellowstone. The ignimbrites also exhibit marked depletion in $\delta$18O, which is known to characterise the SR-type rhyolites of the central Snake River Plain, and cumulatively represent {\~{}}1,700 km3 of low $\delta$18O rhyolitic magma (feldspar values 2.3–2.9‰) erupted within 800,000 years. Our work reduces the total number of ignimbrites recognised in the central Snake River Plain by 6, improves the link with the ashfall record of Yellowstone hotspot volcanism and suggests that more large-volume ignimbrites await discovery through detailed correlation work amidst the vast ignimbrite record of volcanism in this bimodal large igneous province.},

abstract = {{\P}A carbonatite dyke, extremely enriched in rare earth elements (REE), is reported from Bayan Obo, Inner Mongolia, North China. The REE content in the dyke varies from 1 wt{\%} to up to 20 wt{\%}. The light REEs are enriched and highly fractionated relative to the heavy REEs, and there is no Eu anomaly. Although carbon isotope $\delta$13C (PDB) values of the carbonatites (−7.3 to −4.7‰) are within the range of normal mantle (−5±2‰), oxygen isotope $\delta$18O (SMOW) (11.9 to 17.7‰) ratios apparently are higher than those of the mantle (5.7±1.0‰), indicating varying degrees of exchange with hydrothermal fluids during or after magmatic crystallization. The carbonatite is the result of partial melting followed by fractional crystallization. Primary carbonatite melt was formed by less than 1{\%} partial melting of enriched mantle, leaving a garnet-bearing residue. The melt then rose to a crustal magma chamber and underwent fractional crystallization, producing further REE enrichment. The REE and trace element distribution patterns of the carbonatites are similar to those of fine-grained dolomite marble, the ore-host rock of the Bayan Obo REE–Nb–Fe giant mineral deposit. This fact may indicate a petrogenetic link between the dykes described here and the Bayan Obo mineral deposit.},

abstract = {Trace element abundances in melt inclusions are commonly used to interpret melting and melt extraction processes. These interpretations, however, often assume that the chemical compositions of melt inclusions are identical to the liquid from which the host crystal grew, even though driving forces for postentrapment diffusion and modification are demonstrable. This paper begins to quantify the effects of diffusion on melt inclusions using a numerical model. The model calculates the compositional evolution of a spherical inclusion which initially is in equilibrium with a crystal host out to some distance rjump and out of equilibrium beyond. In particular we consider the end-member scenario, whereby the trapped melt is initially out of equlibrium with the neighboring crystal as this sets the minimum time for reequilibration. A package of numerical codes is provided that allows the user to explore other initial conditions. The model calculates the change in inclusion composition and also the structure of diffusion halos that grow around the inclusion as it reequilibrates with the surrounding crystal. The detection of these profiles in naturally occurring inclusions may allow the time since entrapment and the initial inclusion concentration to be estimated. The extent of reequilibration is most strongly influenced by the partition coefficient, diffusivity, and the inclusion radius. Fast-diffusing elements with high mineral/melt partition coefficients are modified rapidly, particularly in small inclusions. Because minerals have very different Dmineral/melt for the various elements, the effects of diffusive reequilibration differ substantially from one mineral to another. For example, the higher partition coefficients of the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) in olivine make HREE concentrations easier to modify than light rare earth elements (LREE) concentrations. In contrast, Sr, Eu, and Ba in plagioclase hosted inclusions equilibrate more rapidly than the other trace elements. Examination of published trace element concentrations of olivine hosted inclusions show little evidence for reequilibration, at least for the light REE and other highly incompatible elements. It is difficult, however, to provide firm constraints due to the uncertainties in olivine diffusivities and the initial condition. In contrast, trace element diffusivities in plagioclase have been determined experimentally [Cherniak, 2001], and the trace element concentrations of published plagioclase hosted inclusions show evidence for extensive diffusive exchange with the host in a manner consistent with model predictions. Postentrapment modification therefore is likely an important factor in the interpretation of some melt inclusion data.},

abstract = {Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet(1). While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs(2,3). Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust(4-7). Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.},

abstract = {Basanite intrusions from the Early Cretaceous Erongo complex, Namibia, have compositions consistent with near-primary mantle melts derived from a depth of at least 100 km. These rocks provide a key reference for the mantle component(s) involved in breakup-related magmatism in this region. Initial Sr–Nd–Pb isotope ratios of the Erongo basanites and associated tephrites and phonotephrites (87Sr/86Sr = 0{\textperiodcentered}70425–0{\textperiodcentered}70465; $\epsilon$Nd = +1{\textperiodcentered}8 to +2{\textperiodcentered}7; 206Pb/204Pb = 18{\textperiodcentered}63–18{\textperiodcentered}91) are independent of the degree of differentiation and correspond closely to an estimated range for the Tristan plume at 130 Ma. Incompatible trace element ratios also overlap with ratios of ocean island basalt (OIB) from the South Atlantic islands of Tristan da Cunha, Gough and Inaccessible associated with the modern Tristan hotspot. The Tristan plume signature of Erongo basanite–tephrite intrusions is shared by at least six other Early Cretaceous mafic alkaline complexes in Namibia, whereas the associated flood basalts in general lack a plume signature. We attribute the contrast in mantle sources for the flood basalts and alkaline complexes to their relative timing with respect to lithospheric thinning. Thick lithosphere during the main flood basalt event prevented direct melting of the Tristan plume and magmas were generated mostly from the lithosphere. The alkaline complexes intruded later, when the lithosphere was sufficiently thinned to allow decompression melting of the underlying plume mantle. },

abstract = {This paper reviews the available information on the geology, mineralogy, and resources of the significant rare earth element (REE) deposits and occurrences in the Murmansk Region, northwest Russia. The region has one of the largest endowments of REE in the world, primarily the light REE (LREE); however, most of the deposits are of potential economic interest for the REE, only as by-products of other mining activity, because of the relatively low REE grade. The measured and indicated REE2O3 resources of all deposits in the region total 22.4, and 36.2 million tonnes, respectively. The most important resources occur in (1) the currently mined Khibiny titanite-apatite deposits, and (2) the Lovozero loparite-eudialyte deposit. The Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit is a potentially important resource of scandium. These deposits all have polymetallic ores, i.e., REE would be a by-product of P, Ti, and Al mining at Khibiny, Fe, Zr, Ta, and Nb mining at Lovozero, and Fe and Ti mining at Afrikanda. The Keivy block has potential for heavy REE exploitation in the peralkaline granite-hosted Yumperuaiv and Large Pedestal Zr-REE deposits and the nepheline syenite-hosted Sakharyok Zr-REE deposit. With the exception of the Afrikanda perovskite-magnetite deposit (LREE in perovskite) and the Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit (scandium in baddelyite), carbonatite-bearing complexes of the Murmansk Region appear to have limited potential for REE by-products. The sound transport, energy, and mining infrastructure of the region are important factors that will help ensure future production of the REE.},

abstract = {In order to place better constraints on the conditions of core formation on Earth and other planetary bodies we have performed experiments to determine the partitioning of Mo and W between liquid Fe-rich metal and liquid silicate at pressures of 1.5–24 GPa and temperatures of 1803–2723 K. Experiments performed in MgO capsules at 1.5 GPa/1923 K indicate that Mo is in the +4 oxidation state in the silicate at oxygen fugacities {\textgreater}2 log units below the IW (Fe–FeO) buffer. In contrast W6+ is the dominant tungsten oxidation state in the silicate at 1.5 GPa/1923 K and 1.8–3.3 log units below the IW buffer. When our 15 data for pressures between 6 and 24 GPa are combined with those of Cottrell et al.

Metal–silicate partitioning of both Mo and W shows strong dependence on silicate melt composition with both elements becoming more siderophile as the melt becomes more SiO2-rich.

If S is added at constant S/Fe ratio throughout accretion the net effect is negligible. If, however, S is added exclusively during the last 10–20{\%} of accretion DMo and DW become consistent with the silicate Earth contents of these elements. Only small additional adjustments to the model are required to accommodate changes in partitioning of Ni, Co, V, Cr and Nb. We conclude that the Mo and W contents of the silicate Earth indicate that S (and other moderately volatile elements) was added to the Earth during core formation but only during the last ∼20{\%} of accretion. This conclusion is the same as that reached by Sch{\"{o}}nb{\"{a}}chler et al. (2010) from the Ag isotopic composition of silicate Earth.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Kangankunde Carbonatite Complex from the Cretaceous Chilwa Alkaline Province in southern Malawi contains ankeritic and siderite carbonatite that are affected by late stage remobilisation by a carbothermal or hydrothermal fluid. The coarse pegmatitic siderite carbonatite that hosts exotic minerals like monazite, synchysite, bastnasite, strontianite and apatite in vugs and cavities constitutes some of the richest rare earth deposits in the world. Besides these minerals, our studies reveal the presence of collinsite and aragonite from the siderite carbonatite. Fine drusy monazites are seen as overgrowths on thin veinlets of siderite within the rare earth mineralised zones. We present unambiguous SEM-based surface textural evidence such as presence of dissolution-corrosion features like etching along cleavage, solution channels, solution pits, sinstered scaly surface, etc. along with rare earth mineralisation that suggests the exotic minerals in the siderite carbonatite did not crystallise from carbonate magma and are a result of sub-solidus processes involving carbonatite-derived fluids. We believe that the monazite-synchysitebastnasite-strontianite-collinsite assemblages were formed by juvenile post magmatic hydrothermal alteration of pre-existing carbonatite by a complex CO2-rich and alkali chloride-carbonate-bearing fluid at ∼250 to 400°C in an open system. This late ‘magmatic' to ‘hydrothermal' activity was responsible for considerable changes in rock texture and mineralogy leading to mobility of rare earth elements during fluid-rock interaction. These aspects need to be properly understood and addressed before using trace and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry in interpreting carbonatite genesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The origin of igneous layering in the Skaergaard and other intrusions is the subject of much debate. Currently held theories for its origin include gravitational sorting, rhythmic nucleation, and chemical diffusion models. This paper presents data on small-scale, modally-graded, rhythmic layers, one of several distinct types of layering found in the Skaergaard. These layers occur only in the Layered Series of the intrusion, in which they are a widespread, almost ubiquitous feature. They are characterized by strong variations in modal composition, with magnetite, ilmenite, and olivine concentrated in the lower part of the layers, pyroxene in the middle of the layers, and plagioclase in the upper part of the layers. In addition, the layers are size graded, with the largest grain sizes of the different minerals generally occurring where the mineral is most abundant. The chemical composition of both plagioclase and Ca-rich pyroxene do not vary in any regular manner within the layers studied. The forsterite composition of olivine is consistently higher in the lower part of the layers. This trend, however, correlates very strongly with the modal variations of olivine and can be explained by minor amounts of subsolidus reequilibration between cumulus and adcumulus olivine, suggesting that the original composition of cumulus olivine within individual layers was constant.
These results are consistent with layers formed by some gravitational sorting process and, in several cases, are at odds with other theories that have been proposed for the origin of igneous layers. Based on these data and the widespread evidence for current interaction (crossbeds, trough-shaped layers, and internally graded layers), we propose that these layers result from periodic disruption of a static zone of crystal growth on the floor of the magma chamber by convection or density currents. This mechanism, however, is almost certainly not responsible for the formation of all of the types of layering found in the intrusion.},

abstract = {Agpaitic nepheline syenites contain complex zirconium silicate minerals as primary magmatic phases; agpaitic liquidus mineral assemblages are controlled by compositional parameters such as alkalinity and concentrations of water and halogens in the magma. The Larvik Plutonic Complex in the late Palaeozoic Oslo Rift, Norway consists of hypersolvus monzonite (larvikite) and different varieties of nepheline syenite. The nepheline syenite members have miaskitic mineralogy (i.e. zircon stable), except for a suite of late, mildly agpaitic pegmatites, which contain zirconium silicate minerals of the w{\"{o}}hlerite, rosenbuschite and eudialyte groups, in some cases together with zircon. These minerals form part of the liquidus mineral assemblage of the nepheline syenite magma together with fluorite and the rock-forming minerals alkali feldspar, aegirine(–augite), alkali amphibole, biotite, nepheline and sodalite. Low-variance mineral assemblages with two or three zirconium silicate minerals, fluorite and the major rock-forming minerals can be modelled in terms of phase equilibria in a multi-component system involving the sodium disilicate component of the melt and the volatile components water, fluorine and chlorine. A semiquantitative isothermal and isobaric petrogenetic grid in log activity space constructed from the observed mineral assemblages and the compositions of the coexisting minerals indicate that there are at least three trends of evolution leading from a miaskitic to an agpaitic crystallization regime in peralkaline nepheline syenites: (1) the increasing alkalis trend, typically leading to eudialyte-dominated liquidus assemblages (and possibly further to hyperagpaitic residual liquids); (2) the increasing water trend, leading to catapleiite crystallization; (3) the increasing fluorine trend, giving transitionally agpaitic liquidus assemblages with w{\"{o}}hlerite, l{\aa}venite and hiortdahlite, with or without zircon, but eventually with magmatic fluorite; this type of evolution is applicable to weakly agpaitic systems such as the Oslo Rift pegmatites. The evolution of such magmas will most probably terminate at liquidus boundaries also involving eudialyte and/or rosenbuschite, and they are unlikely to evolve to more strongly agpaitic compositions.},

abstract = {Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet(1). While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs(2,3). Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust(4-7). Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.},

Natural rocks of quartz-dioritic and basaltic composition were used as starting materials. Melt compositions covered a range from dioritic to quartz-dioritic and granodioritic. Partition coefficients obtained from experiments with different doping levels at the same run condition indicate that Henry's Law is fulfilled. Partition coefficients were investigated as a function of temperature and phase compositions. Apparent correlations between the clinopyroxene partition coefficients of the REE and degree of depolymerization expressed as nonbridging oxygens per tetrahedron (NBO/T) are due to variations in the Na contents of the clinopyroxenes which are controlled by pressure or NBO/T. Based on the model of Blundy and Wood (1994), which accounts for the strain associated with placing a cation on a particular crystallographic site when the radius of the cation differs from the optimal radius for that site, significant differences between Zr- and Hf partition coefficients as well as correlations between Ti and REE partition coefficients can be explained in terms of differences of their ionic radii. For garnets D(La)/D(Yb) ratios change as a function of temperature much more than for clinopyroxenes. This is also consistent with the Blundy and Wood (1994) model.

Helium content analyses at the surface environment of the volcano were carried out in the summers of 2002, 2003 and 2004. To estimate the diffusion contribution of helium emission, soil porosity was estimated indirectly from the granulometry data measured on a previous soil survey carried out in 1997. Helium enrichments in the soil layer with respect to the air concentration measured on Cumbre Vieja indicate a strong structural control in the degassing processes of the volcano and the excess helium seems to be emitted mainly along both N-S and N-W rifts of the volcano. 4He flux values, calculated following a pure diffusive model, ranged between non-detectable values and 1.0mgm -2d -1 in 2002, 2003 and 2004 surveys. Total 4He emission rate at Cumbre Vieja was estimated in the range of 18-38kgd -1. Isotopic composition of helium measured in soil gases along the N-S volcanic-rift of Cumbre Vieja showed small contributions of MORB-type helium increasing towards the southern part of the volcano. A 3He/ 4He ratio of 9.95??0.12 R A was measured at a cold spring (geothermal) sample, showing a 7.2{\%} contribution of plume-type helium. 3He emission results in the range of 0.6-0.7mol/yr support the hypothesis of contemporary degassing at Cumbre Vieja coming from magmas stored at different depths under La Palma island. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Spitskop contains calcite and dolomite carbonatite closely associated with pyroxenite, ijolite and nepheline syenite, and provides an ideal opportunity to study the petrogenetic relationships between alkaline silicate and carbonatite magmatism. The pyroxenites are not alkalic and are preserved as xenoliths within a plug-like intrusion of ijolite. Nepheline syenites are highly peralkaline, though not agpaiitic, and intrude the ijolites as a series of sheets. These units are cut by a plug of carbonatite composed of an incomplete marginal zone of calcite and dolomite–calcite carbonatite, and a larger central zone of ferroan dolomite carbonatite. Clinopyroxene compositions change systematically from diopside-rich compositions in the pyroxenites to aegirine-augite–hedenbergite in the ijolites to acmite-dominated compositions in the nepheline syenites. Whole-rock chemical data indicate, however, that the nepheline syenites and ijolites are unlikely to be related through fractional crystallization of any reasonable combination of their component minerals (clinopyroxene, nepheline, perthite) from a common parental magma. Low total rare earth element (REE) concentrations and flat to convex-up normalized patterns in the syenites contrast strongly with the steep, light REE (LREE)-enriched patterns in the ijolites. The silicate and carbonatite components differ markedly in their $\epsilon$Sr–$\epsilon$Nd compositions, the carbonatites having more depleted values ($\epsilon$Sr –10 to +10; $\epsilon$Nd –1 to –8) than the silicates ($\epsilon$Sr 0 to +33; $\epsilon$Nd –8 to –13). In addition, the calcite-rich carbonatites have more negative $\epsilon$Nd (–6 to –8) than the dolomite carbonatites (–1 to –4). Contrasting isotopic compositions along with the geochemical variations within and between the silicates and carbonatites argue against them being derived from conjugate immiscible liquids. Instead, it is proposed that the carbonatites evolved from primitive carbonate liquids produced directly by low-degree melting of carbonated mantle peridotite. A preliminary model is presented to explain how mantle carbonatite melts can ascend through the mantle and into the crust. It is proposed that the silicate magmatic rocks associated with the carbonatite are produced by melting of enriched mantle lithosphere induced by the influx of deeper-sourced carbonatite melts. },

abstract = {Concentrations of H2O, F, Cl, C, P, and S have been measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in experimentally produced peridotite phases (including clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, garnet, amphibole, and mica) and coexisting basanitic glasses. Because only two experiments produced glasses on quenching (with the melt phase in others reverting to felt-like crystallite masses) H2O concentrations in melts were also separately determined from mass-balance relationships and by assuming constant H2O/La in melts and starting materials. The resulting values were used to calculate mineral/melt partition coefficients ( D values) for H2O [where D H2Ocrystal/melt = (mass fraction of H2O in crystal)/(mass fraction of H2O in melt)] for conditions of 1025–1190 °C and 1.0–3.5 GPa. These gave 0.0064–0.0164 for clinopyroxene, 0.0046–0.0142 for orthopyroxene, 0.0015–0.0016 for olivine, and 0.0016–0.0022 for garnet. Although less information was obtained for the other volatiles, F was found to be significantly more compatible than H2O during peridotite melting, whereas Cl is significantly less compatible. S also has small but appreciable solubilities in amphiboles and micas, but not in pyroxenes or olivine. The solubility of C in silicate minerals appears to be negligible, although C was present in coexisting melts ({\~{}}0.5 wt{\%} as CO2) and as residual graphite during experiments. The D values for H2O in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene are positively correlated with ivAl but negatively correlated with the H2O concentrations of melts (when considered as wt{\%}). These relationships are consistent with the broad trends of previously published partitioning data. Although some of the concentration dependence can be related to cross-correlation between ivAl in pyroxenes and H2O concentrations in melts (via the latter's control of liquidus temperatures) this relationship is too inconsistent to be a complete explanation. A concentration dependence for D H2Omineral/melt can also be independently predicted from speciation models for H2O in silicate melts. Thus it is likely that D H2Opyx/melt is influenced by both ivAl and the absolute concentration of H2O in melts. D H2O/ D Ce for clinopyroxene is inversely correlated with M2 site radii. Because the latter decrease with increasing pressure and temperature, relatively hot and/or deeply derived melts should be enriched in Ce relative to H2O when compared to melts from cooler and shallower mantle sources. Conversely, melts from H2O-rich settings (e.g., subduction zones) should have higher H2O/Ce than their source rocks. When combined with previously obtained partitioning data for non-volatile elements (from the same experiments), our data are consistent with the enrichment of intraplate basalt sources in both volatile and non-volatile incompatible elements by small-degree melts derived from local mid-ocean ridge basalt sources. In this way, volatiles can be seen to play an active role (via their promotion of partial-melting and metasomatic processes) in the auto-regulation of incompatible element concentrations in the depleted upper mantle.},

abstract = {Elemental and isotopic compositions of spinel peridotite, pyroxenite and glimmerite xenoliths in Eocene minette dikes from the Highwood Mountains and Eagle Buttes, Montana, U.S.A., reveal a prolonged, yet episodic, history of melt removal and addition within the shallow lithospheric mantle of the Archean Wyoming Craton or its modified margin. Ancient, but highly variable, enrichment in incompatible elements is indicated by extreme Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions (87Sr86Sr = 0.705 to 1.02; ϵNd = −9 to −43; 206Pb204Pb = 15.8 to 23.2). Very low 187Os188Os (0.110 or less), corresponding to Re depletion model ages (TRD) of 2.7 to 2.9 Ga in some of the peridotites reflects melt removal during the Archean. At least one product of Archean melt migrating through this mantle section is preserved as a websterite xenolith that gives 2.7 Ga model ages for both the SmNd and ReOs isotopic systems. The majority of xenoliths, however, define PbPb and SmNd isochrons of mid-Proterozoic age and have ReOs TRD ages of 2 Ga or less. The mid-Proterozoic age could reflect either the time of formation of these peridotites in the shallow mantle or a time of severe overprinting of the incompatible element budget of pre-existing material by interaction with migrating fluids and/or melts. Glimmerite veins within one harzburgite sample yield 1.8 Ga monazite UPb ages and probably represent the products of crystallization of the fluid/melt responsible for the incompatible element enrichment. The material introduced in the Proterozoic was derived from much older, presumably Archean, crustal materials as shown by marked negative Eu anomalies in many samples and highly evolved initial Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. The data highlight the complex chemical evolution experienced by mantle lithosphere and suggest a coupling between the timing of processes affecting the lithospheric mantle and those recorded in the overlying crustal section.},

abstract = {Twenty four subcalcic garnets from the Finsch mine (SA) were analysed for major and trace elements and Lu–Hf and Sm–Nd-isotopes. Subcalcic garnets are common in heavy mineral concentrates from kimberlites where they stem from disrupted (cpx-free) harzburgites and dunites and they occur as inclusions in diamonds. They control the abundance of most trace elements in such rock types. Thus, the investigation of the trace elements and isotopic composition of subcalcic garnets should directly provide information on the origin, genesis and the age of their host rock. We were able to distinguish two groups of garnets: group-1 with low Cr{\#} ({\textless} 11.4), which correlates negatively with CaO and positively with (Lu/Er)N and group-2 displaying high and variable Cr{\#} (10.9–34.3) but constantly low (Lu/Er)N. These findings imply that group-1 garnets were mainly generated by depletion in the garnet and group-2 garnets by partial melting in the spinel stability field. Group-1 garnets yield a well defined Hf isochron with an age of 2.52 ± 0.06 Ga, likely representing the final depletion of the subcratonic mantle. The high initial of this isochron ($\epsilon$Hf {\~{}} + 25) indicates that the mantle was already significantly depleted prior to this last depletion event. Group-2 garnets scatter around this isochron at very low Lu/Hf ratios. Sm–Nd does not yield a well defined isochron for either garnet group. Group-1 garnets form an errorchron corresponding to about 1.3 ± 0.39 Ga, while most of group-2 garnets form an errorchron corresponding to 0.4 ± 0.12 Ga. These findings imply that the present day mantle underneath Finsch (and by inference of the Kaapvaal craton) is the residue of multiple, in situ depletions interfaced with subducted residues of partial melting at low pressures in ocean ridge like settings. The first depletion may have been at around 3.6 Ga for group-1 garnets and occurred mainly in the garnet stability field. For group-2 garnets, the first depletion event took place at low pressures in the spinel or plagioclase stability field prior to 2.5 Ga. The second and final depletion event took place at around 2.5 Ga in the garnet stability field underneath an existing continental crust. This depleted mantle was subsequently metasomatized at least twice. Re-enrichment occurred in two stages, one at around 1.3 ± 0.39 Ga by a subduction related fluid phase and a second at around 0.4 ± 0.12 Ga with melt as metasomatic agent.},

abstract = {The Moine Thrust Zone in the Scottish Highlands developed during the Scandian Event of the Caledonian Orogeny, and now forms the boundary between the Caledonian orogenic belt and the undeformed foreland. The Scandian Event, and the formation of the Moine Thrust Zone, have previously been dated by a range of isotopic methods, and relatively imprecise ages on a suite of alkaline intrusions localized along the thrust zone have provided the best age constraints for deformation. Recent British Geological Survey mapping has improved our understanding of the structural relationships of some of these intrusions, and this work is combined with new U–Pb dates in this paper to provide significantly improved ages for the Moine Thrust Zone. Our work shows that a single early intrusion (the Glen Dessarry Pluton) was emplaced within the orogenic belt to the east of the Moine Thrust Zone at 447.9 ± 2.9 Ma. A more significant pulse of magmatism centred in the Assynt area, which temporally overlapped movement in the thrust zone, occurred at 430.7 ± 0.5 Ma. Movement in the thrust zone had largely ceased by the time of emplacement of the youngest intrusions, the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at 429.2 ± 0.5 Ma, and the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex.},

abstract = {We have combined metal–silicate partitioning data from the literature with new experimental results at 1.5–8 GPa and 1480–2000 °C to parameterize the effects of pressure, temperature and composition on the partitioning of V, Cr and Nb between liquid Fe metal (with low S and C content) and silicate melt. Using information from the steelmaking literature to correct for interactions in the metal phase, we find that, for peridotitic silicate melts, metal–silicate partition coefficients are given by: log D Nb met/sil = 2.5 log D Fe met/sil + 1.57 - 11 , 930 T - 114 ( ± 43 ) P T ± 0.41 log D V met/sil = 1.5 log D Fe met/sil + 0.582 - 6493 T - 62 ( ± 19 ) P T ± 0.08 log D Cr met/sil = log D Fe met/sil + 0.643 - 4232 ( ± 538 ) T - 22 ( ± 13 ) P T where D i met/sil is the partition coefficient for element i. Partitioning of V and Cr is insensitive to silicate melt composition, but Nb shows a considerable compositional effect. The new data enable us to examine different models of terrestrial accretion and core formation. If we fix the Fe content of the mantle at the current value and use the Ni content of the mantle to estimate pressure of equilibration then temperatures about 1200 °C above the silicate liquidus are required to match vanadium partitioning to the current concentration of V in the mantle. Under these conditions the core concentrations of Si (∼15{\%}) and Nb ({\textgreater}60{\%} of Earth's budget) are implausibly high. A more realistic approach is to assume that the metal of accreting planetesimals equilibrated at the base of a deep magma ocean whose temperature was close to the silicate liquidus. As the magma ocean deepened in proportion to the size of the Earth the metal was continuously extracted to the core without further re-equilibration in the lowermost mantle. In this case the V, Cr and Nb contents of core and mantle can easily reproduce the expected values provided the Earth became more oxidized as it accreted (O'Neill H. S. (1991) The origin of the Moon and the early history of the Earth—a chemical model. 2. The Earth Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 55(4), 1159–1172; Wade J. and Wood B. J.

(1988) Chemical-composition and accretion history of terrestrial planets. Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. A-Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 325(1587), 545–557). Increasing oxidation requires the oxidized Fe content of the mantle to increase from 0.5{\%} to 1.0{\%} to the current value of 6.26{\%} as the Earth grew. This model , with magma ocean thickness corresponding to 35{\%} of mantle depth, reproduces the calculated core–mantle partitioning of Ni, and Co and yields a Si content of the core of approximately 6{\%}, in good agreement with cosmochemical estimates.},

The intrusions are predominantly nepheline syenite, but minor pyroxenite is found at Ilomba and alkali syenite and granite are associated with nepheline syenite at Mphompha. The chemistry and mineralogy of four representative nepheline syenite intrusions (Kasungu, Chipala, Ilomba, and Ulindi) have been investigated. Pyroxenes vary in composition from diopside (pyroxenite) through aegirine-augite to aegirine. Al-rich micas (Ilomba and Ulindi) may reflect primary magmatic compositions. Rocks from three intrusions plot near the minimum in the 1 kbar Nepheline-Albite-Orthoclase-Kalsilite phase diagram, indicating that they represent evolved liquids. Rocks from the fourth intrusion (Ilomba) are apparently cumulates. NbTa, Zr/Hf, and Th/U ratios vary from those typical of ocean-island basalt (OIB) to very high ratios which may reflect a hydrothermal overprint. Rare earth element patterns are steep, slightly to moderately concave upwards, and typically lack Eu anomalies. The Ulindi and Ilomba nepheline syenites were derived by nepheline, pyroxene, and titanite fractionation of a basanite-nephelinite magma, whereas the Kasungu and Chipala nepheline syenites were fractionated from an alkali basalt magma. These magmas originated from a subcontinental OIB-like source.},

Mineralization styles varied across the belt, as well as within different parts of the same deposit. Styles include vein-stockworks, pegmatites, breccias and disseminated REE mineralization. Based on geological, geochemical and inclusion studies, this paper proposes a new model for carbonatite hosted REE mineralization. The results show that ore-forming fluid is derived from carbonatite magma, which has high temperature, pressure and density, and is characterized by high K, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, REE and SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} contents. The supercritical ore fluid underwent a distinctive evolution path including phase separation, exolution of sulfate melt and unmixing between aqueous fluid and liquid CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Rapid geochemical evolution of a dense carbonatite fluid causes REE mineralization and associated alteration to occur within or proximal to the source carbonatite. Veins, pegmatites and carbonatite comprise a continuum of mineralization styles. Veins occur in the outer zone of the upper levels of the deposit. Pegmatites occur in the inner zone of upper levels, whereas disseminated REE ore occurs at the base of the carbonatite. High water solubility in the carbonatite magma and low water, high REE in the exsolved ore-forming fluids, imply that a giant carbonatite body and deep magma chamber are not necessary for the formation of giant REE deposits.},

These samples reveal five different mineral assemblages if classified by the presence of fayalite, aenigmatite, ilmenite, and magnetite: (1) augite + fayalite + ilmenite + magnetite, (2) augite + fayalite + ilmenite, (3) hedenbergite or sodian hedenbergite + fayalite + ilmenite + aenigmatite + quartz, (4) sodian hedenbergite or aegirine-augite + ilmenite + aenigmatite + quartz ± ferrorichterite, and (5) aegirine-augite + aenigmatite + quartz. Alkali feldspar (Or35–37) is present as the dominant phyric phase in each assemblage. Whole-rock silica and peralkalinity correlate strongly with the mineral assemblage: assemblage 1 is found in the sample with the lowest agpaitic index [A.I. = molar (Na + K)/Al] and silica concentration (A.I. {\textless} 1.31, SiO2 {\textless} 64.8 wt{\%}) and equilibrated at 991–888°C at an oxygen fugacity between 0.7 and 1.1 log units below the FMQ buffer (FMQ – 0.7 to FMQ – 1.1). Assemblage 2 is associated with a higher agpaitic index and silica concentration (A.I. = 1.42, SiO2 = 67.1{\%}) and equilibrated at {\~{}}794°C at FMQ – 0.5. Assemblage 3 is associated with a still higher agpaitic index and silica concentration (A.I. in the range 1.55 – 1.63, 66.8 {\textless} SiO2 {\textless} 67.8{\%}) and equilibrated at 764–756°C at FMQ – 0.5 to FMQ – 0.2. Assemblage 4 is associated with a slightly higher agpaitic index and yet higher silica concentration (1.61 {\textless} A.I {\textless} 1.75, 67.6 {\textless} SiO2 {\textless} 72.0{\%}) and equilibrated between 740–700°C at oxygen fugacities at or just below the FMQ buffer. Assemblage 5 is associated with the highest agpaitic index and highest concentration of silica (A.I. = 1.97, SiO2 = 69.7{\%}) and equilibrated at {\textless}700°C at an oxygen fugacity just above the FMQ buffer in a “no-oxide” field. Despite the paucity of two-oxide, two-pyroxene, or two-feldspar pairs, it may be possible to accurately constrain temperature and oxygen fugacity in peralkaline rocks with QUIlF equilibria given an equilibrium assemblage of fayalite, ilmenite, and clinopyroxene.},

abstract = {The Siberian Traps large igneous province is of enormous size ({\~{}} 7 × 106 km2) and volume ({\~{}} 4 × 106 km3). It contains effusive, intrusive and volcanoclastic rocks varying in compositions from ultramafic to felsic, though low-Ti basalts and their intrusive analogs are the predominant rock types. In this paper, we provide new 40Ar/39Ar ages for two lava units of the geographic center of the Siberian Traps, the Central Putorana region (240.9 ± 1.3/2.6/5.5 and 246.6 ± 1.4/2.7/5.6 Ma, where ages are calculated relative to Bern4M with an assigned age of 18.7 (± 0.096) Ma and errors are stated in the form ± x/y/z, where x and y and z are analytical, internal and external errors, respectively), three dolerite sills from the Angara-Taseevskaya syncline of the southeastern Siberian Traps (242.8 ± 1.3/2.6/5.0 Ma, 239.1 ± 1.1/2.5/4.9 Ma and 255.8 ± 4.7/5.3/6.9 Ma) and a lamproite dyke from the Noril'sk region (238.3 ± 1.3/2.6/5.3 Ma). In combination with available geochronologic data our results suggest that voluminous low-Ti basaltic magmatism appeared during different pulses. At least two volcanic pulses are recognized: at the Permo-Triassic boundary ({\~{}} 249 Ma or 252 Ma using the 40Ar/39Ar and U–Pb timescales, respectively) and about 10 Ma later in the Middle Triassic. Granitic magmatism overlapped in time with the two flood basalt pulses, but continued into the Late Triassic ({\~{}} 229 Ma using the U–Pb timescale). Prolonged magmatism of the Siberian Traps province is also supported by geologic observations and paleomagnetic data. New geochronologic findings are discussed in light of the different models for the origin of the Siberian Traps and applied to a Middle Triassic mass extinction event.},

abstract = {The crystal-structures of seven synthetic pyroxenes along the jadeite–hedenbergite (Jd57Hd43, Jd26Hd74, Jd0Hd100) and jadeite–aegirine (Jd100Ae0, Jd76Ae24, Jd35Ae65, Jd0Ae100) joins were refined using data collected by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (space group C2/c, R4$\sigma$ between 2.2 and 3.4{\%}).
The M2 and M1 polyhedral volumes and bond lengths increase with increasing aegirine and heden-bergite content, moreover the Ca for Na substitution along the jadeite–hedenbergite join changes the M2 coordination from 6 + 2 to 4 + 4, with remarkable tilting of the tetrahedral chains. The value of the displacement parameters follows the trend UeqM2 {\textgreater} UeqO2 {\textgreater} UeqO3 {\textgreater} UeqO1 {\textgreater} UeqM1 ≈ UeqT for all samples belonging to the jadeite–aegirine join and for pure hedenbergite; in contrast,, for pyroxenes with intermediate compositions between hedenbergite and jadeite the trend is UeqO1 {\textgreater} UeqO2 {\textgreater} UeqM2 {\textgreater} UeqO3 {\textgreater} UeqM1 ≈ UeqT, with O1 and O2 having anomalously large displacement parameters, probably due to different local structural configuration around the cations with different size and charge.
Cation substitution at the M1 site of Na-pyroxenes gives rise to a different structural deformation with respect of the double substitution at both the M1 and M2 sites in (Na,Ca)(M3+,M2+)Si2O6 pyroxenes as the rigid tetrahedral chains try to accommodate both the increasing size of the M1 site and the different coordination requirement of the M2 site.},

abstract = {The Soldier Meadow Tuff in north-western Nevada is part of a sequence of peralkaline and subalkaline rhyolitic rocks of Miocene age that occupies an area of about 1,600 km2 and has a volume of about 50 km3. The formation is mostly welded tuff containing abundant alkali feldspar and quartz phenocrysts in devitrified groundmass containing minute needles of blue-green alkali amphibole. The rhyolite of Badger Mountain is similar in mineralogy and chemistry, but textures suggest that it is a flow rhyolite. The underlying rhyolite of Catnip Mountain and tuff of Trough Mountain are phenocryst-poor but apparently also peralkaline. Gravity and aeromagnetic anomaly maps show 16- by 24-km anomalies near Badger Mountain. An analysis of these maps suggests that observed anomalies could be caused by a concealed caldera of 2,700-m thickness filled with rocks 0.2 g/cm3 less dense and 0***002 emu/cm3 lower magnetic susceptibility than the surrounding rocks. Distribution of the Soldier Meadow Tuff and the occurrence of numerous vents in the rhyolite of Badger Mountain suggest that the source for both units is associated with the indicated caldera. Possible alternative sources are other calderas whose locations are suggested by a 7- by 11-km gravity minimum near Rock Spring Table and a 12- by 24-km magnetic minimum west of Soldier Meadow.},

@article{Vasyukova2016a,
abstract = {Strange Lake is a mid-Proterozoic peralkaline granite pluton (Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador, Canada) that underwent extreme enrichment in high field strength elements (HFSE), including the rare earth elements (REE). The HFSE mineralisation is confined to highly altered pegmatites and the most altered parts of the granites, implying a genetic association between hydrothermal fluids and HFSE enrichment. This study uses analyses of fluid inclusions to investigate the hydrothermal evolution of the Strange Lake pluton and the role of hydrothermal processes in concentrating the HFSE to potentially exploitable levels. Five groups of inclusions were distinguished. From earliest to latest, these groups are: primary aqueous inclusions ({\~{}} 25 wt{\%} NaCl eq.) associated with melt inclusions (Group 1); primary aqueous inclusions (13–23 wt{\%} NaCl eq.) associated with CH4 inclusions (Groups 2a and b); primary aqueous inclusions ({\~{}} 9 wt{\%} NaCl eq.) associated with CO2 inclusions (Group 3); primary aqueous inclusions ({\~{}} 9 wt{\%} NaCl eq.), which contain no carbonic component (Group 4); and finally, secondary aqueous inclusions (19 wt{\%} NaCl eq.), including inclusions that outline mineral pseudomorphs, also with no detectable carbonic component (Group 5). Most of the inclusions (except those in Group 5) have conspicuous ‘implosion' haloes, evident as numerous tiny voids. This indicates that the inclusions re-equilibrated, most likely during isobaric cooling. Fluid evolution commenced with the exsolution of a saline aqueous liquid ({\~{}} 25 wt{\%} NaCl eq.) and an immiscible CH4 + H2 gas from the pegmatitic melt at temperatures of {\~{}} 450–500 °C and a pressure of {\~{}} 1100 bars. During isobaric cooling, the gas component of the fluid was gradually oxidised, evolving from being CH4-dominant to a CH4 fluid with a significant proportion of higher order hydrocarbons (due to oxidative coupling of methane induced by the consumption of O2 through the alteration of arfvedsonite to aegirine; {\~{}} 325–360 °C), and finally to a CO2-dominated fluid at {\~{}} 300 °C. The apparent salinity of the aqueous fluid decreased from {\~{}} 25 to {\~{}} 4.5 wt{\%} NaCl eq. due to fluid-rock interaction. The latter also caused precipitation of nahcolite (as a result of the reaction of newly formed CO2 with sodium from decomposing minerals), formation of pseudomorphs after primary Na-zirconosilicates and Na-titanosilicates and replacement of primary REE-silicates by bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce). Owing to this interaction, the carbonic component of the fluid was consumed which, together with the consumption of H2O to form Al-, K- and Fe-phyllosilicates, contributed to an increase in the fluid salinity (up to {\~{}} 19 wt{\%} NaCl eq.). Light rare earth elements (LREE) were remobilised over 10s to 100 s of metres by the high temperature high salinity fluid (preserved as Group 1 and 2a inclusions), whereas heavy rare earth elements (HREE) were remobilised on a much smaller scale by a late, low temperature high salinity fluid (trapped as inclusion Group 5). Fluid preserved as inclusion Group 3 may have been responsible for remobilisation of Zr and Ti.},

abstract = {1 The Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research (PCIGR) at the University of British Columbia has undertaken a systematic analysis of the isotopic (Sr, Nd, and Pb) compositions and concentrations of a broad compositional range of U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) reference materials, including basalt (BCR-1, 2; BHVO-1, 2), andesite (AGV-1, 2), rhyolite (RGM-1, 2), syenite (STM-1, 2), granodiorite (GSP-2), and granite (G-2, 3). USGS rock reference materials are geochemically well characterized, but there is neither a systematic methodology nor a database for radiogenic isotopic compositions, even for the widely used BCR-1. This investigation represents the first comprehensive, systematic analysis of the isotopic composition and concentration of USGS reference materials and provides an important database for the isotopic community. In addition, the range of equipment at the PCIGR, including a Nu Instruments Plasma MC-ICP-MS, a Thermo Finnigan Triton TIMS, and a Thermo Finnigan Element2 HR-ICP-MS, permits an assessment and comparison of the precision and accuracy of isotopic analyses determined by both the TIMS and MC-ICP-MS methods e. g., Nd isotopic compositions). For each of the reference materials, 5 to 10 complete replicate analyses provide coherent isotopic results, all with external precision below 30 ppm 2 SD) for Sr and Nd isotopic compositions 27 and 24 ppm for TIMS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively). Our results also show that the first- and second-generation USGS reference materials have homogeneous Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. Nd isotopic compositions by MC-ICP-MS and TIMS agree to within 15 ppm for all reference materials. Interlaboratory MC-ICP-MS comparisons show excellent agreement for Pb isotopic compositions; however, the reproducibility is not as good as for Sr and Nd. A careful, sequential leaching experiment of three first- and second-generation reference materials (BCR, BHVO, AGV) indicates that the heterogeneity in Pb isotopic compositions, and concentrations, could be directly related to contamination by the steel (mortar/pestle) used to process the materials. Contamination also accounts for the high concentrations of certain other trace elements e. g., Li, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, W) in various USGS reference materials},

abstract = {As technical advances have dramatically increased our ability to analyze trace elements, the need for more reliable data on the compositional dependence of trace element partitioning between minerals and melt has become increasingly important. The late-Cretaceous Carmacks Group of south central Yukon comprises a succession of primitive high-Mg ankaramitic lavas characterized by shoshonitic chemical affinities and containing large complexly zoned clinopyroxene phenocrysts. The compositional zonation of the clinopyroxene phenocrysts is characterized by relatively Fe-rich (Mg{\#} = Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0.85), but mottled, cores surrounded by mantles of cyclically-zoned clinopyroxene whose Mg{\#} varies repeatedly between 0.9 and 0.80. These cyclically zoned clinopyroxene mantles appear to record the repeated influx and mixing of batches of primitive with more evolved magma in a deep sub-crustal (∼1.2 GPa) magma chamber(s). Laser ablation ICP-MS was used to analyze the trace element variation in these zoned clinopyroxenes. The results indicate more than a threefold variation in the absolute concentrations of Th, Zr, rare earth elements (REE), and Y within individual clinopyroxene phenocrysts, with no apparent change in the degree of REE or high field strength element (HFSE) fractionation. The variation in absolute abundances of trace elements correlates closely with the major element composition of the clinopyroxene, with the most enriched clinopyroxene having the lowest Mg{\#} and highest Al contents. The problem is that the amount of crystal fractionation required to explain the major element variation (∼20{\%}) in these clinopyroxene phenocrysts cannot explain the increase in the abundance of the incompatible trace elements, which would require more than 70{\%} crystal fractionation, if constant partition coefficients are assumed. The anomalous increase in incompatible trace elements appears to reflect an increase in their partition coefficients with increasing AlIV in the clinopyroxene; with an increase in Al2O3 from 1.5 to 4.0 wt.{\%} during ∼20{\%} crystal fractionation over a temperature decrease of ∼100°C being associated with more that a threefold increase in the partition coefficients of Th, Zr, REE, and Y. The magnitude of these increases may indicate that the substitution of these trace elements into clinopyroxene is better modeled in some natural systems by a local charge balance model, rather than the distributed charge model that better replicates the results of annealed experiments. These findings indicate that the effect of Al on the partition coefficients of incompatible trace elements in clinopyroxene may be under appreciated in natural magmatic systems and that the application of experimentally determined clinopyroxene partition coefficients to natural systems must be done with caution.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic assessment of the uranium-oxygen system is presented. A consistent set of experimental data is selected among the numerous data in the literature on the phase diagram and oxygen chemical potential. The thermodynamic properties of the phases are described using the compound energy model with ionic constituents for the solids and an ionic two-sublattice model for the liquid. For the uranium dioxide, the structure is described using three sublattices, one for the cations U3+, U4+ and U6+, one for the normal site of oxygen ions, and one for the interstitial oxygen ions. Vacancies are included in both oxygen sublattices. In this first approach, the homogeneity ranges of the U4O9-y and U3O8-y compounds are not represented. A set of consistent model parameters that describes both the phase diagram and the oxygen chemical potential data in the whole composition range is thus obtained. The description of this basic binary system will be used to calculate higher order systems such as O-U-Zr and Fe-O-U which are important for simulating severe nuclear accidents. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chromite from massive chromitite follows two compositional trends on the basis of cation ratios: trend A—decreasing Mg/(Mg + Fe) with increasing Cr/(Cr + Al); trend B—decreasing Mg/(Mg + Fe) with decreasing Cr/(Cr + Al). The chromitites are divided into five stages on the basis of which trend they follow and the data of Eales et al. (Chemical Geology 88:261–278, 1990) on the behaviour of the Mg/Fe ratio of the pyroxene and whole rock Sr isotope composition of the environment in which they occur. Following Eales et al. (Chemical Geology 88:261–278, 1990), the different characteristics of the stages are attributed to the rate at which new magma entered the chamber and the effect of this on aAl2O3 and, in the case of stage 5, the appearance of cumulus plagioclase buffering the aAl2O3. The similarity of PGE profiles across the MG-3 and MG-4 chromitites that are separated laterally by up to 300 km and the variation in V in the UG-2 argue that the chromitites have largely developed in situ. Modelling using the programme MELTS shows that increase in pressure, mixing of primitive and fractionated magma, felsic contamination of primitive magma or addition of H2O do not promote crystallization of spinel before orthopyroxene (in general they hinder it) and that the Cr2O3 content of the magma was of the order of 0.25 wt.{\%}. Less than 20{\%} of the chromite in the magma is removed before orthopyroxene joins chromite, which implies a {\textgreater}13-km thickness of magma for the Critical Zone. It is suggested that the large excess of magma has escaped up marginal structures such as the Platreef. The PGE profile of chromitites depends on whether sulphide accumulated or not along with chromite. Modelling shows that contamination of Critical Zone magma with a felsic melt will induce sulphide immiscibility, although not chromite precipitation. The LG-1 to LG-4 chromitites developed without sulphide, whilst those from the LG-5 upwards had associated liquid sulphide. Much of the sulphide originally in the LG-5 and above has been destroyed as a result of reaction with the chromite.},

abstract = {Annite, KFe3AISi3O10(OH)2 a member of the iron biotites and the ferrous analogue of phlogopite, has been synthesized and its phase relations have been determined as functions of temperature, fugacity of oxygen (fo2), and total pressure (Ptotal≈PH2O+PH2). A method for controlling fo2at high total pressures is described, and data for the ‘oxygen buffers' used are given. Buffers range from quartz+iron+fayalite assemblages (low fo2) to magnetite-hematite assemblages (high fo2). Optical properties and unit-cell dimensions of synthetic annites depend on the conditions of synthesis. By recalculating published analyses of natural iron-rich biotites it can be shown that one cannot assume a constant hydrogen content for such biotites. Oxidation may have occurred by drying at 115°C. Octahedral occupancy therefore cannot be calculated from such data. Phase relations of annite are presented in 2,070 and 1,035 bar sections. Depending on fo2-T values annite was found to decompose to one of the following assemblages: hematite+ sanidine, magnetite+sanidine, fayalite+leucite+kalsilite, iron+sanidine. All decompositions are dehydration and redox reactions and are sensitive to changes in fH20 and fo2 (or fH20 and fH2). At 2, 070 bars total pressure annite+magnetite+sanidine can coexist between 425°C and 825° C, depending upon the magnitude of fo2. In the presence of quartz the stability field of annite is more restricted. Phase equilibria in the system KAlSiO4–SiO2–Fe–O2–H2 have been summarized schematically. Wherever possible, thermodynamic extrapolations are made to test the internal consistency of the data. Enthalpies of formation are calculated for both annite and phlogopite. Ranges of fo2 values in nature as well as mechanisms for changes in fo2 are investigated. It is useful to distinguish between assemblages which are internally buffered with respect to fo2changes and those which are not buffered. The applications of individual reactions involving annite to specific geologic problems are discussed with respect to igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Franklin large igneous province on Victoria Island, Canada, is characterized by continental flood basalts and a sill-dominated feeder system. Field relationships indicate that fault-guided transfer zones allowed magma to jump up-section to form higher-level intrusions. Where sills connect to dikes and magmas moved up-section, roof and wall rocks are characterized by wide and intense contact-metamorphic haloes, consistent with throughflow of magma. The geometric constraints suggest that conduits may have opened episodically and then closed when magma pressure waned. The episodic nature of conduit opening events can explain the pulsed ascent of crystal slurries, and may also play a role in the deposition of Ni-sulfides.},

@article{McDonough1990,
abstract = {Major and trace element data for 375 spinel lherzolite and harzburgite xenoliths from continental basalts are used to constrain the nature and composition of the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM). The major and compatible trace elements (e.g., Ni, Co) have similar average and median values, whereas median values of the highly incompatible trace elements (e.g., LREE, Rb) are systematically lower than their average values. Both the average and median compositions have LREE-enriched patterns, with La abundances at about 10 and 3 times C1 chondrites, respectively, and a relatively flat HREE pattern at about 2 times C1 chondrites. Relative to the primitive mantle, highly incompatible trace elements are enriched in the average and median, whereas the mildly incompatible elements (e.g., the middle and heavy REE, Hf, Ti, V, Sc, Al, Ca, etc.) are depleted. The enrichment pattern of incompatible elements in these peridotites is comparable to that in ocean island basalts, although at lower absolute abundances. For most elements the average composition provides an estimate of the bulk composition of the CLM, however for those elements with a strong degree of skewedness in their data the median composition may provide a more reasonable estimate.

A comparison of geochemical data for spinel and garnet peridotites reveals many similarities, however, garnet peridotites have, on average, lower concentrations of elements with bulk distribution coefficients close to 1.0 (eg., HREE, Sc, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cr). These differences may be attributed to regional variation or age of the lithosphere sampled. It is proposed that the values reported here may be best viewed as a compositional estimate of the post-Archaean CLM.

The composition of the CLM is consistent with a growth and stabilization model involving the underplating of refractory peridotite diapirs produced during magmatism, and to a lesser extent by advective thickening of the lithosphere. The incompatible element enriched character of the CLM has been developed in intraplate and/or divergent-margin tectonic environments. The absence of a convergent-margin chemical signature in peridotite xenoliths, as characterized by a Nb depletion or enrichment, argues against incompatible element-enrichment of CLM in this environment.

The incompatible element-enriched character of the CLM does not possess the necessary source composition for continental flood basalts, therefore alternative crustal and/or mantle sources need to be considered for these large volume incompatible element-enriched melts. Although the CLM has an incompatible element-enriched character, it does not appear to represent a significant geochemical reservoir for these elements. Based on the median composition, the CLM has less than or equal to 5{\%} of the highly incompatible elements relative to the primitive mantle, and this is about a factor of 5 less than that in the continental crust for such elements.},

abstract = {The covariant behavior of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopes during most magmatic processes has long been recognized, but the details of this behavior in the depleted mantle reservoir have not been adequately examined. We report new whole-rock Hf and Nd isotope data for 1) juvenile, mantle-derived rocks, mid-Archean to Mesozoic in age, and 2) early Archean gneisses from West Greenland. Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of the juvenile rocks are well correlated, with the best fit corresponding to the equation $\epsilon$(Hf) = 1.40 $\epsilon$(Nd) + 2.1, and is similar to the collective Hf-Nd correlation for terrestrial samples of $\epsilon$(Hf) = 1.36 $\epsilon$(Nd) + 3.0. The early Archean Greenland gneisses, in contrast, have an extreme range in $\epsilon$(Nd) values (-4.4 to +4.2; Bennett et al., 1993) that is not mirrored by the Hf isotopic system. The $\epsilon$(Hf) values for these rocks are consistently positive and have much less variation (0 to +3.4) than their $\epsilon$(Nd) counterparts. The information from the Hf isotopic compositions of the West Greenland gneisses portrays an early Archean mantle that is relatively isotopically homogeneous at 3.8 to 3.6 Ga and moderately depleted in incompatible elements. There is no evidence that any of these gneisses have been derived from an enriched reservoir. The Hf isotopic data are in stark contrast to the Nd isotopic record and strongly imply that the picture of extreme initial isotopic heterogeneity indicated by Nd isotopes is not a real feature of the West Greenland gneisses but is rather an artifact produced by disturbances in the Sm-Nd isotope system of these rocks. Although Hf and Nd isotopic data do not uniquely constrain either the nature of the earliest crust or the timing of crustal growth, the most probable candidate for the enriched reservoir complementary to the depleted mantle in the pre-4.0 Ga Earth is a mafic, oceanic-type crust. In order to explain the predominantly positive $\epsilon$(Hf) and $\epsilon$(Nd) values for the early Archean rocks, this crust must have had a short residence time at the surface of the Earth before returning to the mantle where it was isolated from mixing with the depleted mantle for several hundred million years. The following period from 3.5 to 2.7 Ga may mark a transition during which this early formed mafic crust was mixed progressively back into the depleted mantle reservoir. While a present-day volume of continental crust at 4.0 Ga cannot be excluded on isotopic grounds, we find such a scenario unlikely based on the lack of direct isotopic and physical evidence for its existence. An important aspect of crustal growth and evolution, therefore, may be the transformation of the enriched reservoir from being predominantly mafic in the early Earth to becoming progressively more sialic through time.},

abstract = {The northern Ethiopian rift forms the third arm of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden triple junction, and marks the transition from continental rifting in the East African rift to incipient oceanic spreading in Afar. We determine the P- and S-wave velocity structure beneath the northern Ethiopian rift using independent tomographic inversion of P- and S-wave relative arrival-time residuals from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the Ethiopia Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE) passive experiment using the regularised non-linear least-squares inversion method of VanDecar. Our 79 broad-band instruments covered an area 250 x 350 km centred on the Boset magmatic segment {\~{}}70 km SE of Addis Ababa in the centre of the northern Ethiopian rift. The study area encompasses several rift segments showing increasing degrees of extension and magmatic intrusion moving from south to north into the Afar depression. Analysis of relative arrival-time residuals shows that the rift flanks are asymmetric with arrivals associated with the southeastern Somalian Plate faster ({\~{}}0.65 s for the P waves; {\~{}}2 s for the S waves) than the northwestern Nubian Plate. Our tomographic inversions image a 75 km wide tabular low-velocity zone (dVP=1.5 per cent, dVS=4 per cent) beneath the less-evolved southern part of the rift in the uppermost 200-250 km of the mantle. At depths of {\textgreater}100 km, north of 8.5N, this low-velocity anomaly broadens laterally and appears to be connected to deeper low-velocity structures under the Afar depression. An off-rift low-velocity structure extending perpendicular to the rift axis correlates with the eastern limit of the E-W trending reactivated Precambrian Ambo-Guder fault zone that is delineated by Quaternary eruptive centres. Along axis, the low-velocity upwelling beneath the rift is segmented, with low-velocity material in the uppermost 100 km often offset to the side of the rift with the highest rift flank topography. Our observations from this magmatic rift zone, which is transitional between continental and oceanic rifting, do not support detachment fault models of lithospheric extension but instead point to strain accommodation via magma assisted rifting.},

abstract = {We investigated high-precision Pb isotope ratio analysis by multi-collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) using added thallium as an internal isotopic standard to correct for mass dependent isotopic fractionation. We compared MC-ICP-MS analysis of both an inter-laboratory standard, NBS 981, and geological samples to conventional thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). As expected, we found that analytical error in the latter was dominated by mass fractionation. In MC-ICP-MS, we found that fractionation appears to follow the exponential law, but that the fractionation coefficients, f, of Tl and Pb were not identical. This difference in fractionation coefficients cannot be compensated for by renormalizing to a different Tl isotopic composition as done in other studies. We found, however, that the fPb/fTl ratio was constant over the course of an analytical session, allowing fPb to be calculated from fTl. An exponential law correction was then applied to the Pb isotope measurements which effectively eliminates errors associated with mass fractionation. Precision for the MC-ICP-MS analyses ranged from a factor of 2 to a factor of 6 better than for TIMS analyses for the 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/206Pb ratios respectively. Residual error in the MC-ICP-MS analyses was dominated by error in the analysis of 204Pb, perhaps in part due to random errors introduced by correcting for a 204Hg isobaric interference. We also found systematic errors in the MC-ICP-MS analyses compared to TIMS determinations that may be due to uneven background and collector biases in the instrument used. We found that these systematic errors were the same for both NBS 981 and the geological samples, so accurate correction factors could be generated from the standard analyses to correct the sample analyses. MC-ICP-MS has the additional advantages of requiring less preparative chemistry, less instrument time, and considerably less labor overall.},

Most of the isotopic variation in the marbles is explained in terms of pregranulitic features. Metasomatic transformation of granulites into layered potassic syenitic rocks and emplacement of carbonate veins and breccias occurred during retrogressive granulite facies conditions. The chemistry of these rocks is comparable with that of fenites and carbonatites with high contents of (L)REEs, Th, U, F, C, Ba and Sr but, with respect to these elements, a relative depletion in Nb, Ta, Hf, Zr and Ti. The isotopic compositions of Nd (ɛNd(T)=–6.3 to –9.9), of Sr (87Sr/86Sr(T)= 0.7093–0.7104), and the O isotopic composition of metasomatic clinopyroxene ($\delta$18O = 6.9 to 8‰), all indicate that the fluid had a strong crustal imprint. On the basis of the C isotope ratios ($\delta$13C =–3.5 to –9.7‰), the fluid responsible for the crystallization of carbonates and metasomatic alteration is thought to be derived from the mantle, presumably through degassing of mantle-derived magmas at depth. Intense interaction with the crust during the upward flow of the fluid may explain its chemical and isotopic signatures. The zones of metasomatic alteration in the In Ouzzal granulites may be the deep-seated equivalents of the zones of channelled circulation of carbonated fluids described at shallower levels in the crust.},

abstract = {New Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios and trace clement data for volcanic mafic rocks outcropping along a E-W transect in southern Italy, from Mt. Vulture to Neapolitan volcanoes, are reported. The variation of LILE/HFSE, HFSE/HFSE and radiogenic isotopes along this transect indicates that all of these volcanoes contain both intra-plate and subduction-related signatures, with the former decreasing from Mt. Vulture to Campanian volcanoes. New data Lire also reported for the Paleocene alkaline rocks from Pietre Nere (Apulia foreland), which show isotopic ratios mostly overlapping the values for Mediterranean intra-plate volcanoes as well Lis the Eocene-Oligocene alkaline mafic lavas from the northern Adria plate. Pietre Nere provides evidence for an OIB mantle composition of FOZO-type, free of subduction influences, that is present beneath the Adria plate (Africa) before its collision with Europe. After this collision, and formation of the southern Apennines, westward inflow of mantle from the Adria plate to the Campanian area occured, as a consequence of slab break off. Interaction of subduction components with inflowing Adria mantle generated hybrid sources beneath the Vulture-Campania area, which can explain the compositional features of both Mt. Vulture and the Campanian mafic rocks. Therefore, mafic magmas from these volcanoes represent variable degrees of mixing between different, mantle components.},

abstract = {Variations in the spectral content of volcano seismicity related to changes in volcanic activity are commonly identified manually in spectrograms. However, long time series of monitoring data at volcano observatories require tools to facilitate automated and rapid processing. Techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM) and principal component analysis (PCA) can help to quickly and automatically identify important patterns related to impending eruptions. For the first time, we evaluate the performance of SOM and PCA on synthetic volcano seismic spectra constructed from observations during two well-studied eruptions at Klauea Volcano, Hawai'i, that include features observed in many volcanic settings. In particular, our objective is to test which of the techniques can best retrieve a set of three spectral patterns that we used to compose a synthetic spectrogram. We find that, without a priori knowledge of the given set of patterns, neither SOM nor PCA can directly recover the spectra. We thus test hierarchical clustering, a commonly used method, to investigate whether clustering in the space of the principal components and on the SOM, respectively, can retrieve the known patterns. Our clustering method applied to the SOM fails to detect the correct number and shape of the known input spectra. In contrast, clustering of the data reconstructed by the first three PCA modes reproduces these patterns and their occurrence in time more consistently. This result suggests that PCA in combination with hierarchical clustering is a powerful practical tool for automated identification of characteristic patterns in volcano seismic spectra. Our results indicate that, in contrast to PCA, common clustering algorithms may not be ideal to group patterns on the SOM and that it is crucial to evaluate the performance of these tools on a control dataset prior to their application to real data.},

abstract = {Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands), have undergone several flank and central vent, lava flow and explosive phonolitic eruptions during the last 35 ka, without any apparent structural or petrological control on such a random location of eruption foci. The morphology and size of the volcanic edifices have been changing during that period, but this seems to have not affected the location of new eruptions. In order to investigate what determines the occurrence of either central or flank eruptions at Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, we have performed several numerical experiments considering a wide range of situations in which the main physical conditions (topography, size, depth and shape of the magma chambers, presence of deviatoric stresses, internal structure) of the volcanic system have been changed. The results obtained show that the main control on the pathway that magma will follow to leave the chamber and reach the surface is exerted by the stress field distribution around the chamber, which is a function of the shape of the chamber. This suggests that in the case of Teide–Pico Viejo, where there is not a preferential location for new vents, each new phonolitic eruption is preceded by the modification of the existing magma chamber (or the emplacement of a new batch of magma) that does not necessarily matches the structure of the previous one. The presence of multiple shallow reservoirs containing eruptible magma also influences the stresses distribution around the erupting magma chamber. The numerical results also show that the existence of an extensional stress field plays a significant role in determining the position of the phonolitic feeder dykes.},

abstract = {Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1–4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation. Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting. Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles. We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or ‘wag' against the restoring ‘gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.},

abstract = {The volcanic products of the late Miocene Morron de Villamayor volcano (Calatrava Volcanic Field, central Spain) are known for being one of the few outcrops of leucitites in the entire circum-Mediterranean area. These rocks are important because aragonite of mantle origin has been reported as inclusion in olivine macrocrysts. We use petrographic observations, mineral compositions, as well as oxygen and carbon isotope ratios coupled with experimental petrology to understand the origin of carbonate phase in these olivine-phyric rocks. Groundmass and macrocryst olivines range from $\delta$18OVSMOWof +4.8‰, typical of mantle olivine values, to +7.4‰, indicating contamination by sedimentary carbonate. Carbonates are characterized by heavy oxygen isotope compositions ($\delta$18OVSMOW{\textgreater}+24‰), and relatively light carbon isotopes ($\delta$13CPDB{\textless}−11‰), resembling skarn values, and distinct from typical mantle carbonatite compositions. Petrography, mineral compositions such as low Mg{\#} of clinopyroxene and biotite, low Ca{\#} and low incompatible element abundance of the carbonate, and isotopic ratios of O and C, do not support a mantle origin for the carbonate. Rather, the carbonate inclusions found in the olivine macrocrysts are interpreted as basement limestone fragments entrapped by the rising crystallizing magma. Comparison with experimental carbonatitic and silicate-carbonatitic melts indicates that low-degree partial melts of a carbonated peridotite must have a dolomitic rather than the aragonitic/calcitic composition as those found trapped in the Morron de Villamayor olivine macrocrysts.},

abstract = {This contribution addresses contact metamorphism and fluid flow in calcareous rocks of the Neoproterozoic Shaler Supergroup on Victoria Island, Arctic Canada. These processes occurred due to intrusion of gabbroic sills and dykes at c. 720 Ma during the Franklin magmatic event, which was associated with the break-up of Rodinia. The intrusive sheets (sills and dykes) are a few metres to ∼50 m thick. Metasedimentary rocks were examined in three locations with very good exposures of vertical dykes feeding horizontal sills, the North Feeder Dyke (NFD) complex, the South Feeder Dyke (SFD) complex, and the Uhuk Massif. In the NFD and SFD complexes, protoliths were limestones and dolostones with minor silicates, and at the Uhuk Massif, the protoliths were silty dolostones. At the time of magma emplacement, these locations were at depths of 1-4 km. The widths of contact aureoles are only several decametres wide, commensurate with thicknesses of the dykes and sills. Splays of tremolite mark incipient metamorphism. Highest-grade rocks in the NFD and SFD complexes contain the prograde assemblage diopside + phlogopite whereas at Uhuk they contain the assemblage vesuvianite + garnet + diopside. The assemblages are successfully modelled with T-X(CO2)fluid pseudosections that suggest achievement of CO2-rich fluid compositions due to early decarbonation reactions, followed by influx of aqueous fluids after peak metamorphism. Rapid heating of host rocks and short near-peak temperature intervals are demonstrated by the prevalent morphology of diopside as radial splays of acicular crystals that appear to pseudomorph tremolite and by incomplete recrystallization of calcite in marbles. Calc-silicates in the roof of one sill at Uhuk experienced metasomatic influx of Fe that is evidenced by nearly pure andradite rims on grossular garnet. Vesuvianite, which overgrew the grossular portions of garnet, also contains ferric iron. Vesuvianite was partially consumed during retrograde growth of serpentine and andradite. The occurrence of serpentine in high-grade portions of aureoles is consistent with eventual leveling-off of temperatures between 350 and 400° C, an inference that is supported by modelled conductive heat transfer from the cooling magma sheets.Focused fluid flow near intrusion-wall rock contacts is demonstrated by narrow zones of anomalously low $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values of carbonate minerals. Although the up to 5‰ decrease of both $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values from sedimentary values is much smaller than is typical for calc-silicate aureoles around large plutons, it is greater than what could have been achieved by decarbonation alone. The decrease in $\delta$13C is attributed to fluid-mediated exchange with organic low-13C carbon that is dispersed through the unmetamorphosed rocks and the decrease in $\delta$18O is attributed to fluid-mediated isotopic exchange with the gabbroic intrusive sheets. This study shows that when gabbroic sills and dykes intrude a sedimentary basin, 1) contact aureoles are likely to be narrow, only on the scale of several decametres, 2) short high-temperature regimes prevent achievement of equilibrium metamorphic textures, 3) T-X(CO2)fluid paths in calcareous contact aureoles are likely to be complex, reflecting a transition from prograde decarbonation reactions to influx of aqueous fluids during cooling.{\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

abstract = {Despite the presence of known economic resources in Canada's Arctic archipelago, Victoria Island remains understudied. This study addresses the fluid history and economic potential of two major carbonate units on Victoria Island by integrating fluid inclusion microthermometry with SEM-EDS analysis of evaporate mounds. Three cements containing fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA) occur in the Neoproterozoic Wynniatt Formation: saddle dolomite, brown dolomite and calcite, in paragenetic order. The two dolomite-hosted cements have average homogenisation temperatures (Th) for FIAs (n = 3) of 108°C (saddle) and 101 and 116°C, but metastability precluded determining salinities; most calcite-hosted fluid inclusions are too small and/or necked to obtain Th values, but rare larger inclusions have salinities from 1.7 to 0.4 wt. {\%} NaCl equiv. SEM-EDS analysis of evaporate mounds indicates the fluid changed from an early K-rich (saddle dolomite), to a later K + Na (brown dolomite), and finally Na-rich (calcite), which suggests mixing of two end-member fluids (i.e. Na-rich and K-rich). Dolostone of the lower Paleozoic ‘Victoria Island formation' contains two cements: early quartz and late dolomite. Quartz-hosted FIAs (n = 2) have an average Th value of 126°C, and salinity of 23.2 wt. {\%} NaCl equiv., whereas FIAs (n = 3) in dolomite have average Th values of 109, 116 and 124°C; metastability precluded determining salinity. Evaporate mound analysis for the cements indicates evolution from a Na-rich to a Na + K fluid through interaction with reservoir rocks. A reduced, metal-rich fluid was present during quartz precipitation, as implied by the presence of pyrite framboids along growth zones and nanoparticles of barite and sulphide minerals (Zn, Cu and Pb) in evacuated inclusions, which suggests the area may have potential to host base-metal mineralisation. Importantly, distinguishing different fluid compositions in both of the case studies would not have been possible without evaporate mound analysis and therefore the results emphasise integrating this technique into diagenetic studies.},

abstract = {Nd and Sr isotopic compositions as well as trace element concentrations have been determined on a suite of alkali basalts from the Massif Central, in France. Samples show a typical enrichment in incompatible elements. In particular, the REE patterns exhibit a strong fractionation characterized by a ( La Yb)N ratio of about 20. The YbN content is about 10 times chondrite. The 143Nd 144Nd ratios exhibit a range from 0.512775 to 0.512989, values quite comparable to those from oceanic island basalts. The 87Sr 86Sr ratios vary between 0.70338 and 0.70458 and are anti-correlated with the Nd isotopic ratio. The isotopic and the trace element (in particular REE) data have been used in order to quantitatively model the genesis of the alkali basalts. Among the several types of models tested here, the most likely one appears to be the model of mantle metasomatism. A semi-quantitative approach shows that the source of alkali basalts from the Massif Central was metasomatized prior to melting. In such a model, the basalts could be produced by rather high degrees of partial melting (such as 10 or 15{\%}) of the metasomatically enriched mantle. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated model that explains the magmatic and hydrothermal features of the unique El Laco iron deposit that is located in a Pliocene–Pleistocene volcano of the Chilean Andes. (Sub)volcanic crystallization of an iron-rich melt as massive magnetite promoted the exsolution of a small volume of a hydrosaline melt and of large amounts of vapor that led to the formation of an alkali-calcic hydrothermal assemblage replacing the host andesite; this assemblage is capped and overprinted by a large zone of acid-sulfate steam-heated alteration forming as a whole a protracted shallow-level magmatic-hydrothermal system. Oxygen isotopic data for the massive magnetite ($\delta$18O: 4.3‰–5.0‰) and the alkali-calcic altered rock (diopside $\delta$18O: 7.2‰–8.7‰; magnetite $\delta$18O: 4.4‰–6.7‰) suggest that these rocks are genetically related to the host andesite ($\delta$18O: 7.4‰–9.6‰). The estimated temperature of the mineral assemblage ({\textgreater}∼900 °C) may be the highest recorded in hydrothermal systems, is attributed to exsolution of fluids from the crystallizing iron-rich melts, and is considered unlikely to reflect the convection of surficial fluids.},

abstract = {Here we present a new U-Pb baddeleyite ID-TIMS age of 713.7 ± 0.9 Ma on the shoshonitic Tatonduk Suite near the Yukon-Alaska border in the Proterozoic Tatonduk inlier, which occur as mafic dykes and a sequence of basaltic to intermediate volcanic flows immediately beneath iron formation-bearing Sturtian glacial deposits correlated with the early Cryogenian Rapitan Group. Considering the age overlap with what is inferred to represent the Franklin Large Igneous Province (LIP) of northern Canada, the Tatonduk Suite might logically be considered a far-flung component of the Franklin Large Igneous Province. However, the Tatonduk Suite was emplaced in an actively extending environment {\textgreater}1200 km from the plume head on Melville Island and does not obviously align with the Franklin dyke trend. Furthermore, major, trace and isotopic data on the Tatonduk Suite reveal a composition that is unique from the Franklin LIP and most likely reflects melting of potassic and trace element enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle at pressures of less than 10kb. These volcanics and dykes highlight the complexity in defining what constitutes a LIP. The Tatonduk Suite either represent a non-plume end-member composition of the Franklin LIP, or more likely, rift volcanics associated with extension along the actively extending margin of northwestern Laurentia. Although the plume and rifting may be geodynamically linked, this interpretation suggests that this new age for the Tatonduk Suite does not constrain the timing of Franklin magmatism. The Tatonduk Suite was emplaced during the Sturtian Snowball Earth event and contributes to the growing body of geochronological data that indicates the onset of glaciation at ca. 717 Ma. Furthermore, this age provides direct evidence for the syn-glacial origin of Sturtian iron formation in the Tatonduk inlier and further links iron formation to widespread mafic magmatism at this time.},

abstract = {A detailed study of 43 lava flows comprising two stratigraphic sequences exposed along the north and south walls of Barranco de los Tilos on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands, reveals a complex, temporally segmented record of geodynamo behavior that contains no less than three distinct geomagnetic events. The Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) reversal is recorded in five transitionally magnetized lava flows from the north (TN) section. The isochrons obtained from three of the lower four M-B lavas are defined by 14 incremental heating experiments that, together with a previous age determination, yielded a weighted mean of 798.4 ± 6.2 ka (all uncertainties ±2$\sigma$). In addition, a 780.3 ± 10.3 ka isochron was determined for the overlying transitionally magnetized flow, indicating that it was erupted during a distinctly younger portion of the transition. Near the base of the south (TS) section one finds a sequence of weakly magnetized flows associated with virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) positions in the southwest Indian Ocean between latitudes 56°S and 65°S, suggesting instability of the geomagnetic field beyond that of typical secular variation. 40Ar/39Ar isochrons from three of these flows, defined by 11 separate incremental heating experiments, gave a weighted mean of 822.2 ± 8.7 ka. This anomalous field behavior recorded 24 ± 11 kyr prior to the M-B reversal may coincide with an event featured in several marine sediment records. Directly above two normal polarity flows (40Ar/39Ar isochrons of 751.9 ± 18.1 ka and 675.0 ± 15.7 ka) are nine transitionally magnetized lavas having magnetization directions associated with low to midlatitude VGPs spanning 23°–60°N. These flows are then capped by a single flow possessing normal polarity. Based on 12 incremental heating experiments, 40Ar/39Ar isochrons of five of these nine lavas, along with the uppermost flow, gave a weighted mean age of 580.2 ± 7.8 ka for this period of transitional to normal field behavior. From these same transitional lavas, Quidelleur et al. [1999] reported three unspiked K-Ar ages with a weighted mean of 602 ± 24 ka and proposed a new event called the “La Palma” excursion. However, the 40Ar/39Ar age presented here is three times more precise than the K-Ar age and is indistinguishable at the 95{\%} confidence level from the 40Ar/39Ar age of a lava from the Snake River Plain, Idaho, that originally defined the Big Lost event. Transitional field behavior of similar age observed in astronomically dated marine cores further establishes that the Big Lost event recorded at La Palma was indeed global in extent. Rigorous temporal and geomagnetic constraints for several additional periods of geomagnetic field instability during the last several million years will comprise a geomagnetic instability timescale that can be factored confidently into models of the dynamo process.},

This is established by systematic, rigorous quantum chemistry calculations of the isotopomers BrLBr, where L is an isotope of hydrogen. All the heavier isotopomers of BrHBr, BrDBr, BrTBr, and Br4HBr, the latter indicating the muonic He atom, the heaviest isotope of H, can only be stabilized as van der Waals bound states. In contrast, the lightest isotopomer, BrMuBr, with Mu the muonium atom, alone exhibits vibrational bonding, in accord with its possible observation in a recent experiment on the Mu+Br2 reaction. Accordingly, BrMuBr is stabilized at the saddle point of the potential energy surface due to a net decrease in vibrational zero point energy that overcompensates the increase in potential energy.},

abstract = {Since the onset of their eruptive activity within the Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera, about 180 ka ago, Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes have mainly produced lava flow eruptions of basaltic to phonoltic magmas. The products from these eruptions partially fill the caldera, and the adjacent Icod and La Orotava valleys, to the north. Although less frequent, explosive eruptions have also occurred at these composite volcanoes. In order to assess the possible evolution Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes and their potential for future explosive activity, we have analysed their recent volcanic history, assuming that similar episodes have the highest probability of occurrence in the near future. Explosive activity during the last 35000 years has been associated with the eruption of both, mafic (basalts, tephro–phonolites) and felsic (phono–tephrites and phonolites) magmas and has included strombolian, violent strombolian and sub-plinian magmatic eruptions, as well as phreatomagmatic eruptions of mafic magmas. Explosive eruptions have occurred both from central and flank vents, ranging in size from 0.001 to 0.1 km3 for the mafic eruptions and from 0.01 to {\textless} 1 km3 for the phonolitic ones. Comparison of the Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes with the previous cycles of activity from the central complex reveals that all them follow a similar pattern in the petrological evolution but that there is a significant difference in the eruptive behaviour of these different periods of central volcanism on Tenerife. Pre-Teide central activity is mostly characterised by large-volume (1–{\textgreater} 20 km3, DRE) eruptions of phonolitic magmas while Teide–Pico Viejo is dominated by effusive eruptions. These differences can be explained in terms of the different degree of evolution of Teide–Pico Viejo compared to the preceding cycles and, consequently, in the different pre-eruptive conditions of the corresponding phonolitic magmas. A clear interaction between the basaltic and phonolitic systems is observed from the products of phonolitic eruptions, indicating that basaltic magmatism is the driving force of the phonolitic eruptive activity. The magmatic evolution of Teide–Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes will continue in the future with a probably tendency to produce a major volume of phonolitic magmas, with an increasing explosive potential. Therefore, the explosive potential of Teide–Pico Viejo cannot be neglected and should be considered in hazard assessment on Tenerife.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Geological Society of America. The more than 500 fossil Ca-carbonatite occurrences on Earth are at odds with the only active East African Rift carbonatite volcano, Oldoinyo Lengai (Tanzania), which produces Na-carbonatite magmas. The volcano's recent major explosive eruptions yielded a mix of nephelinitic and carbonatite melts, supporting the hypothesis that carbonatites and spatially associated peralkaline silicate lavas are related through liquid immiscibility. Nevertheless, previous eruption temperatures of Na-carbonatites were 490-595 °C, which is 250-450 °C lower than for any suitable conjugate silicate liquid. This study demonstrates experimentally that moderately alkaline Ca-carbonatite melts evolve to Na-carbonatites through crystal fractionation. The thermal barrier of the synthetic Na-Ca-carbonate system, held to preclude an evolution from Ca-carbonatites to Na-carbonatites, vanishes in the natural system, where continuous fractionation of calcite + apatite leads to Na-carbonatites, as observed at Oldoinyo Lengai. Furthermore, saturating the Na-carbonatite with minerals present in possible conjugate nephelinites yields a parent carbonatite with total alkali contents of 8-9 wt{\%}, i.e., concentrations that are realistic for immiscible separation from nephelinitic liquids at 1000-1050 °C. Modeling the liquid line of descent along the calcite surface requires a total fractionation of {\~{}}48{\%} calcite, {\~{}}12{\%} apatite, and {\~{}}2 wt{\%} clinopyroxene. SiO 2 solubility only increases from 0.2 to 2.9 wt{\%} at 750-1200 °C, leaving little leeway for crystallization of silicates. The experimental results suggest a moderately alkaline parent to the Oldoinyo Lengai carbonatites and therefore a common origin for carbonatites related to alkaline magmatism.},

abstract = {We segregated coexisting gabbroic and granitic melts by centrifuging them at high pressures and temperatures and measured the trace element compositions of the melts by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the effect of melt structure contributes about one order of magnitude to crystal/melt partition coefficients. Partitioning of alkali and alkaline earth elements strongly depends on field strength: Amphoteric and lone pair electron elements partition into the polymerized granitic melt; and rare earth, transition, and high field strength elements coordinated by nonbridging oxygens partition remarkably similar into the gabbroic melt. A regular solution model predicts these effects.},

abstract = {While the geomorphic consequences of Pleistocene megafloods have been known for some time, it has been only in the past 2 decades that hydrogeologists and glaciologists alike have begun to appreciate the important impact that ice sheet-aquifer interactions have had in controlling subsurface flow patterns, recharge rates, and the distribution of fresh water in confined aquifer systems across North America. In this paper, we document the numerous lines of geochemical, isotopic, and geomechanical evidence of ice sheet hydrogeology across North America. We also review the mechanical, thermal, and hydrologic processes that control subsurface fluid migration beneath ice sheets. Finite element models of subsurface fluid flow, permafrost formation, and ice sheet loading are presented to investigate the coupled nature of transport processes during glaciation/ deglaciation. These indicate that recharge rates as high as 10 times modern values occurred as the Laurentide Ice Sheet overran the margins of sedimentary basins. The effects of ice sheet loading and permafrost formation result in complex transient flow patterns within aquifers and confining units alike. Using geochemical and environmental isotopic data, we estimate that the volume of glacial meltwater emplaced at the margins of sedimentary basins overrun by the Laurentide Ice Sheet totals about 3.7 x 10 4 km 3, which is about 0.2{\%} of the volume of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Subglacial infiltration estimates based on continental-scale hydrologic models are even higher (5-10{\%} of meltwater generated). These studies in sum call into question the widely held notion that groundwater flow patterns within confined aquifer systems are controlled primarily by the water table configuration during the Pleistocene. Rather, groundwater flow patterns were likely much more complex and transient in nature than has previously been thought. Because Pleistocene recharge rates are believed to be highly variable, these studies have profound implications for water resource managers charged with determining sustainable pumping rates from confined aquifers that host ice sheet meltwater.},

abstract = {Bulk-rock concentrations of included elements, such as Ni, Cr, and V, decline in a normal fashion from the lowest levels of the Skaergaard Layered Series to the Sandwich Horizon, but their distributions are highly irregular. Only a small part of the scattered bulk-rock abundances of these elements can be attributed to varied proportions of the minerals in which these elements tend to be concentrated; by far the greatest part results from the different concentrations in the individual minerals, even at the same stratigraphic horizon. An inventory of included trace elements in rocks at a given level shows little correlation between bulk-rock concentrations and modal proportions of mafic minerals. For example, rocks with little olivine but abundant pyroxene or oxides have about the same Ni contents as those with much more olivine. As a result, the Ni contents of individual minerals differ from one sample to the next and have no apparent relationship to the crystal–liquid partition coefficients for conventional magmatic compositions and conditions. The bulk-rock concentrations and internal partitioning between minerals appear to be a function of the mobilities of the individual elements and the degree to which they have been altered by subsequent metasomatic changes of the mineral assemblage and major-element compositions. The results show that one cannot safely use magmatic partition coefficients and trace-element compositions of minerals to deduce the compositions of liquids from which coarse-grained mafic rocks crystallized.},

abstract = {The Silurian Vinalhaven intrusive complex (VIC) is dominated by granite with subordinate gabbrodiorite. It was emplaced at a shallow crustal level (1–2 kbar) into pre-Silurian metamorphic rocks and apparently cogenetic basalts and high-silica rhyolite. The main granite body is about 12 km in diameter and includes an ∼1 km thick section of inward-dipping, originally subhorizontal, gabbrodiorite sheets that extends more than 10 km along strike, creating a mafic–silicic layered intrusion (MASLI). Fine-grained granite dikes are probably feeders for the silicic magma chamber, and basaltic dikes are probably feeders for the gabbroic sheets. Gabbroic rocks form the bases of macrorhythmic layers from 10 to 150 m thick that grade upward from chilled gabbro through gabbroic cumulates to hybrid rocks and granite; many layers can be traced for several kilometers. Abundant country rock blocks (up to 100 m) occur at many levels within the MASLI. The granite has widespread arcuate schlieren and settled enclaves, which define aggrading magma chamber floors and suggest a depositional origin for most granite below, within and above the MASLI. Mafic magmas are equivalent to low-K tholeiites, and silicic magmas are comparable with high-silica rhyolites (72–78{\%} SiO2). Compositional variation in the MASLI reflects both hybridization with granite and crystal accumulation at the base of a compositionally zoned magma chamber. Mafic input heated and enhanced convection in the felsic magma chamber and locally rejuvenated older granite, producing a porphyry that crystallized at higher T and lower H2O contents. Thermal arguments suggest that the thickness of the silicic magma chamber was at least hundreds of meters, and perhaps as much as 1 km. Because the extent of the basaltic sheets approached 75 km2, at times the volume of eruptible silicic magma ranged from 10s of km3 to 100 km3. The VIC provides a possible smaller-scale template for the magmatic plumbing system beneath large bimodal volcanic systems such as Yellowstone.},

abstract = {We have investigated trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and silicic melts ranging from 62 to 69 wt{\%} SiO2 in piston-cylinder experiments at 1.1 GPa and 1145-1155 degrees C. Run products consist of diopsidic clinopyroxene (with 3-5 wt{\%} Al2O3 and similar to 1 wt{\%} Na2O) coexisting with silicic, aluminous, and alkaline melts. Clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients for rare earth elemendts (REE) are significantly higher (e.g., D-Sm = 0.76 to 3.1) than previous studies of clinopyroxene-basaltic melt partitioning. The maximum D-REE is also shifted toward middle REE (e.g., Tb). Although the partition coefficients of Sr and Ti (D-Sr = 0.23-0.39, D-Ti = 0.28-1.0) are also elevated relative to clinopyroxene-basaltic melt, partition coefficients for Zr and Li (0.14-0.23 and 0.16-0.25, respectively) are within the range of literature values. The high partition coefficients for REE, Sr, and Ti in this study do not reflect crystal-compositional effects. For instance, no relationship is observed between Al-1V and these partition coefficients. REE and Ti partition coefficients correlate poorly with jadeite component of the clinopyroxene; however, the elevated Na2O contents of both the melt and clinopyroxene make it difficult to discriminate fully the effect of jadeite component from the effect of changes in melt structure. The non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation ratio (NBO/T; Mysen et al. 1985) varies from 0.08 to 0.17 and roughly correlates with D-epx/melt(REE), consistent with a recent study (Gaetani 2004) that concluded that melt structure significantly affects partitioning when NBO/T {\textless} 0.49. Notably, we find a strong correlation between the molar Ca2+/(M+ + M2+) of the melt and the optimum D (D-0) for the REE, indicating that melt structure, and not jadeite content, is the dominant control on clinopyroxene-melt partitioning in these experiments. The partition coefficients for the REE, Ti, Zr, and Sr are in good agreement with observed clinopyroxene-silicic glass partitioning within mantle xenoliths (Chazot et al. 1996; Vannucci et al. 1998), indicating these results may apply to lithospheric melting. Furthermore, the origin of hump-shaped REE patterns observed in residual clinopyroxene from abyssal peridotites could be explained if shallow depleted melts of peridotite are silica-rich. A two-stage fractional melting model assuming clinopyroxene-silicic melt partitioning at shallow mantle depths from 10 to 30 km beneath a mid-ocean ridge can reproduce the observed hump-shaped REE patterns. If so, hump-shaped REE patterns may provide evidence for the existence and extraction of silica-rich melt created in the shallow mantle.},

Both cases illustrate how chromatographic and reaction effects can lead to chromatographic separation of the elements aid the formation of metal alloys and other PGE-rich, S-poor phases beneath sulfide zones. as are observed in many PGE deposits. The principal difference between the "dry" magmatic precipitation Of Sulfide as a cotectic phase and those sulfides arising from fluid migration in a crystallizing "wet" pile of crystals is that the former cannot exceed cotectic proportions of sulfide unless there is preferential settling of sulfide, and the Pd metal zone is ephemeral. In contrast. the latter mechanism can produce sulfide-enriched zones in which Sulfide abundance exceeds expected cotectic levels of saturation.},

Comparison of the pre-edge peak data with those of Fe model compounds with known oxidation state and coordination number allowed for determination of the Fe oxidation state and coordination number for all the glasses analyzed. The Fe3+/(Fe3++Fe2+) ratio varies from 0.44 to 0.93 (+/- 0.05) in the glasses studied. The determined values are in excellent agreement (within 0.03 difference) with those independently measured by the titration method. Moreover, pre-edge peak data clearly indicate that Fe3+ is in fourfold coordination, whereas Fe2+ exists both in fourfold and fivefold coordination for this phonolitic composition, although the presence of minor amounts of sixfold-coordinated Fe cannot be ruled out by XANES data alone. EXAFS data of the most oxidized sample indicate that Fe3+ is in tetrahedral coordination with {\textless} Fe-O {\textgreater} = 1.85 A (+/- 0.01). This value compares well with literature data for Fe-[4](3+) (e.g., in tetra-ferriphlogopite or rodolicoite). Calculated NBO/T ratios decrease with Fe oxidation (from 0.23 to 0.19). For phonolitic glasses of this study, going from reducing to oxidizing conditions results in a higher fraction of network-forming Fe, thus increasing the polymerization of the tetrahedral network and producing shorter (and stronger) {\textless} Fe-O {\textgreater} bond distances. Both the polymerization increase and the structural variations in the Fe local environment can qualitatively explain the strong increase in melt viscosity observed at higher oxygen fugacity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Journal of Science. All rights reserved. Nolans-type ore deposits contain REE and Th mineralization hosted in fluorapatite veins. These veins intrude granulite facies rocks and are surrounded by a diopside selvage. Nolans-type deposits are thought to form by REE, F and P-rich hydrothermal fluids derived from alkali or carbonatitic intrusions. However, REE are not effectively transported in F and P-rich systems. REE ore deposits are commonly hydrothermally overprinted, possibly obscuring the igneous nature of the primary mineralization. We conducted a series of piston cylinder “sandwich” experiments, testing the hydrothermal fluid hypothesis, and a newly suggested process of carbonatite metasomatism. Our results confirm theoretical predictions that REE are hydrothermally immobile in these systems and the experimental phase assemblage is not compatible with the natural rocks. Our results show that fluorapatite can only host several weight percent levels of REE at temperatures higher than 600 °C. Below that temperature, a miscibility gap exists between REE-poor fluorapatite and REE-rich silicates such as britholite or cerite. In contrast, experiments reacting P and REE-rich carbonatite with silicate rock above 700 °C closely resemble natural rocks from Nolans-type deposits. Selvage mineralogy is sensitive to the MgO content of the carbonatite. A diopside selvage formed at carbonatite MgO/(CaOMgO) 0.2 while wollastonite and forsterite formed at lower and higher ratios, respectively. Phosphate solubility in carbonatites decreases with decreasing MgO contents. As diopside formed, REE-rich fluorapatite preferentially crystallized from the selvage inwards. Thus, carbonatites are effective at simultaneously mobilizing REE, F and P to the site of deposition. Nolans-type deposits are the cumulate residue of this reaction, with the carbonatite liquid migrating elsewhere. At temperatures below 700 °C the carbonatite–silicate reaction additionally formed monticellite, cuspidine and magnesioferrite, resembling a skarn assemblage. Whereas skarns form by infiltration of silicate magmas or related fluids to carbonate rocks, our experiments are the opposite: intrusion of carbonatite into silicate rock. These mid-crustal skarn-like rocks may host elevated ore elements of carbonatitic affinity, such as F, P, Y, REE, Th, Ba, Sr, and Nb. We propose the term “antiskarn” to describe such systems, and suggest they trace the migration of carbonatite liquids through the crust. Hydrothermal reworking, retrogression, or metamorphism of antiskarns may obscure the carbonatitic genesis of the rocks. These metasomatic zones are the crustal equivalent of wehrlites that form by peridotite–carbonatite reaction at mantle depths.},

@article{VanAcken2013,
abstract = {The bimodal Naivasha complex (central Kenya) comprises 2 suites of transitional basalts and 7 chemostratigraphic groups of comendites. The early basalt series (EBS) predates the Group 1 comendites with the later series (LBS) erupted between Groups 5 and 6. Basalts from both suites are notable for their relatively radiogenic 207Pb/204Pb isotope ratios which are higher than in the majority of ocean island basalt (OIB, Zindler {\&} Hart, 1986), and 87Sr/86Sr ratios more radiogenic than basalts from northern Kenya. Both basalt suites exhibit systematic trace element and isotopic variations which appear related to greater assimilation of Proterozoic amphibolite facies crust by the chemically more evolved rock types. Their mantle source regions show evidence of residual plagioclase and have a ‘Dupal'-like OIB trace element and Pb-Sr-Nd isotope signature (Hart, 1984). A contribution from the sub-continental lithosphere is proposed in basalt genesis. The seven comendite groups have distinct trace element and isotope systematics. Hydration of comendite glass causes significant changes in Sr and Pb isotope ratios. In terms of their Sr-Nd isotope relationships the unaltered comendites could be derived from the basalts by an assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process dominated by the fractional crystallization of feldspars. However, the Pb systematics clearly demonstrate that the basalts and comendites are not part of a cogenetic suite. Chemical variations within individual comendite groups are predominantly the result of fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst assemblages (i.e. alkali feldspar dominated) and minor crustal interaction. The majority of the chemical and isotopic differences between Groups 1–7 cannot be explained by fractional crystallization and appear to represent crustal melts derived from close to the interface between Pan African basement and the overlying Miocene-Holocene volcanoclastic rocks, at approximately 6 km depth (KRISP working group, 1987). Halogens play a fundamental role in the petrogenesis of the comendites (Cl+F{\textless}1{\textperiodcentered}7 per cent) permitting small degree melts of low viscosity to be extracted from the crust and causing the breakdown of minor phases e.g, zircon. These factors explain the extreme enrichment of certain incompatible trace elements (Zr{\textless}2500, Nb{\textless}700) in the comendites and coupled with the retention of zircon in the source of the halogen poor comendites (Group 1{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}6 per cent Cl+F) result in notable fractionation among the HFSE (Zr/Nb 1{\textperiodcentered}5–5{\textperiodcentered}5). Halogens may be concentrated in the source region from the surrounding crust by the presently active hydrothermal system. Each of the chemostratigraphic comendite groups is chemically distinct, implying that partial melting of the heterogeneous crust is on a limited scale and that no extensive magma chambers exist beneath Naivasha.},

abstract = {Plate tectonic processes introduce basaltic crust (as eclogite) into the peridotitic mantle. The proportions of these two sources in mantle melts are poorly understood. Silica-rich melts formed from eclogite react with peridotite, converting it to olivine-free pyroxenite. Partial melts of this hybrid pyroxenite are higher in nickel and silicon but poorer in manganese, calcium, and magnesium than melts of peridotite. Olivine phenocrysts' compositions record these differences and were used to quantify the contributions of pyroxenite-derived melts in mid-ocean ridge basalts (10 to 30{\%}), ocean island and continental basalts (many {\textgreater}60{\%}), and komatiites (20 to 30{\%}). These results imply involvement of 2 to 20{\%} (up to 28{\%}) of recycled crust in mantle melting.},

abstract = {Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions were determined for a suite of Archean garnet peridotite and garnet pyroxenite xenoliths and their host Nikos kimberlite (100 Ma) from Somerset Island to constrain the isotopic character of the mantle root beneath the northern Canadian craton. The Nikos peridotites are enriched in highly incompatible trace elements (La/SmN = 4-6), and show 143Nd/144Nd(1) (0.51249-0.51276) and a large range in 87Sr/86Sr(1) (0.7047-0.7085) and Pb (206Pb/204Pb(1) = 17.18 to 19.03) isotope ratios that are distinct from those estimated for "depleted mantle" compositions at the time of kimberlite emplacement. The Nd isotopic compositions of the peridotites overlap those of the Nikos kimberlite, suggesting that the xenoliths were contaminated with kimberlite or a kimberlite-related accessory phase (i.e., apatite). The highly variable Sr and Pb isotopic compositions of the peridotites, however, indicate that kimberlite contribution was restricted to very small amounts (???1 wt {\%} or less). The high-temperature peridotites ({\textgreater}1100??C) that sample the deep Somerset lithosphere trend toward more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr(1) (0.7085) and unradiogenic 206Pb/204Pb(1) (17.18) isotopic ratios than those of the low-temperature peridotites ({\textless}1100??C). This is in agreement with Sr isotopic compositions of clinopyroxene from the low-temperature peridotites (87Sr/86Sr(1) = 0.7038-0.7046) that are significantly less radiogenic than those of clinopyroxene from the high-temperature peridotites (87Sr/86Sr(1) = 0.7052-0.7091). The depth correlation of Sr isotopes for clinopyroxene and Sr and Pb isotopic compositions for the Nikos whole-rocks indicate that the deep Somerset lithosphere ({\textgreater}160 km) is isotopically distinct from the shallow lithospheric mantle. The isotopic stratification with depth suggests that the lower lithosphere is probably younger and may have been added to the existing Archean shallow mantle in a Phanerozoic magmatic event. The radiogenic Sr isotope ratios of the high-temperature peridotites and their clinopyroxenes suggest that the underplated deep lithosphere contained recycled (altered oceanic crust and sedimentary component?) material introduced during earlier subduction.

The rare-earth deposits have been formed at the magmatic stage during the process of crystal differentiation, jointly with convection in the magmatic system.

abstract = {The Moine Thrust Zone in the Scottish Highlands developed during the Scandian Event of the Caledonian Orogeny, and now forms the boundary between the Caledonian orogenic belt and the undeformed foreland. The Scandian Event, and the formation of the Moine Thrust Zone, have previously been dated by a range of isotopic methods, and relatively imprecise ages on a suite of alkaline intrusions localized along the thrust zone have provided the best age constraints for deformation. Recent British Geological Survey mapping has improved our understanding of the structural relationships of some of these intrusions, and this work is combined with new U–Pb dates in this paper to provide significantly improved ages for the Moine Thrust Zone. Our work shows that a single early intrusion (the Glen Dessarry Pluton) was emplaced within the orogenic belt to the east of the Moine Thrust Zone at 447.9 ± 2.9 Ma. A more significant pulse of magmatism centred in the Assynt area, which temporally overlapped movement in the thrust zone, occurred at 430.7 ± 0.5 Ma. Movement in the thrust zone had largely ceased by the time of emplacement of the youngest intrusions, the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at 429.2 ± 0.5 Ma, and the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex.},

abstract = {A Pliocene submarine series of alkali basaltic pillow lavas, hyaloclastites, and breccias (A), a sheeted dike swarm (B), and a basal suite of gabbro and ultramafic rocks (C) from La Palma (Canary Islands) is interpreted as a cross section through an uplifted seamount. This series has been tilted to its present orientation of 50°/230° (plunge and azimuth), probably by upwarping due to intrusions in the central portion of the island. The basal plutonic complex (C) also includes intrusives coeval with up to 2000 m of younger subaerial alkali basaltic lavas unconformably overlying the submarine series. The plutonic suite (C) is overlain abruptly by more than 1800 m of sills (B), 0.4–1 m thick on average, with minor screens of lavas and breccias. Extrusives (A) form a 1750 m thick sequence of pillow lavas, breccias, and hyaloclastites. The clastic rocks increase in abundance upward and are of four main types: (1) breccias, consisting of partly broken pillows, formed nearly in situ, (2) heterolithologic pillow fragment breccias, (3) hyaloclastites composed dominantly of highly vesicular lapilli and ash sized shards, the latter thought to have formed by near surface explosive eruptions and been subsequently transported downslope by mass flows, (2) and (3) being interpreted to have been resedimented, and (4) pillow scoria breccias from the upper 700 m of the extrusive section consisting of amoeboidal, highly vesicular “pillows” and lava stringers and local bombs, probably formed by cracking and “bleeding” of gas-rich expanding pillow lava and some shallow submarine/subaerial lava fountaining. The extrusive series is chemically and mineralogically crudely zoned, with the most differentiated rocks (metatrachytes and mugearites) at the base and most picritic lavas occurring near the top of the series. Subsequent to emplacement, the entire extrusive and intrusive series has been hydrothermally altered, the lower part to greenschist and the upper part to smectite—zeolite facies mineral assemblages. The La Palma succession, combined with evidence from surface studies of seamounts, suggests that seamounts are formed by intrusive and extrusive processes in approximately equal portions. The nature of eruptive clastic and depositional mechanisms changes drastically during growth of a seamount if the critical depth for major magmatic degassing is surpassed and especially if magmatic explosive processes can occur at very shallow water depth, the critical depth depending on magma and thus volatile composition. Changes in slopes of a seamount influence depositional processes. Based on these factors, at least three major depositional sites develop as a seamount grows: summit, flank, and apron facies. Nonexplosive, extrusive processes prevail in the Deep Water Stage, dominantly producing pillow lavas (75{\%}). These consist of individual pillow volcanoes up to 200 m high, with large pillows near the base and decreasing pillow size toward the top of a volcano. Pillow breccias, and pillow fragment breccias comprise approximately 20{\%} of this facies. The deep water flank and apron facies are characterized by debris flow deposits with possibjy rather dense matrix material. The Shallow Water (shoaling) Stage is reached when the seamount top reaches the critical depth for drastic increase in exsolution of magmatic volatiles, about 800 m for the alkali basaltic seamount of La Palma, resulting in formation of mainly clastic rocks (70{\%}): in situ pillow rind breccias and scoriaceous amoeboidal breccias and pillows are formed in the summit regions of the seamount, by repeated expansion and leaking of frothy pillow lava possibly by lava fountaining. Resedimented, heterolithologic pillow fragment breccias, lapilli breccias, and hyaloclastites are deposited on the flanks and aprons of the seamount. Pillow lavas comprise {\textless} 30{\%} of these deposits.},

abstract = {The Soldier Meadow Tuff of late Miocene age was erupted from a linear vent area in northwestern Nevada. Numerous ash flows representing about 50 cu km of magma were erupted, followed by less energetic eruption of a small volume of air-fall tuff, which is welded near the vents. The vents then served as feeders for lava flows unquestionably comagmatic with the tuffs. Flow foliation in the lava flows defines four vents aligned in a north-south direction, and part of the internal structure of one of the vents has been exposed by faulting and erosion. The distribution pattern of the ash-flow sheet, the distribution and size variation of xenoliths, and the absence of a cooling break between tuff and lava all support this interpretation. The tuff and lava consist of peralkaline rhyolite (comendite) and are virtually identical in mineralogy and chemistry. Neither caldera collapse nor local subsidence occurred after eruption of the Soldier Meadow Tuff. The arrangement of vents parallel to a range-front fault trend implies control of alignment by extensional Basin-Range faults.
The tuff of Trough Mountain, an earlier unit of phenocryst-poor, comendite ash-flow tuff of more limited volume and extent, appears to have erupted from a vent area which is elongate northward and nearly coincident with that of the Soldier Meadow Tuff, as indicated by thickness, areal distribution, welding of air-fall tuff, and distribution of xenoliths.},

abstract = {Although numerous questions still surround the topic of Henry's law (HL) as it applies to trace element partitioning, there now exist sufficient experimental data to make some generalizations regarding HL behavior in minerals. The most important of these is that the commonly-observed failure of HL at low concentration occurs at distinctly different levels even for chemically-similar elements in a single mineral. This observation in turn provides a basis for discerning effects of HL failure in natural systems: through examination of element ratios in minerals and rocks, it is possible, in principle, to distinguish HL effects from changes in partition coefficients due to variations in other magmatic parameters such as temperature and the compositions of phases. Initial applications of this approach to plagioclase/ liquid partitioning of REE and to the general behavior of ￼ and ￼ during basalt production suggest that HL usually does hold in nature.},

Partition coefficient calculations, equilibrium mineral assemblages, glass compositions and texture were used to reconstruct compositional, thermal and pressure gradients in the pre-eruptive reservoir as well as timing and mechanisms of evolution towards magma chamber overpressure and eruption. Our petrologic data indicate that a wide sill-like trachytic magma chamber was active under the Campanian Plain at 2.5 kbar before CI eruption. Thermal exchange between high liquidus (1199°C) trachytic sill and cool country rocks caused intense undercooling, driving a catastrophic and fast (102 years) in situ fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation that produced a water oversaturated phonolitic cap and an overpressure in the chamber that triggered the super eruption. This process culminated in an abrupt reservoir opening and in a fast single-step high decompression. Sanidine phenocrysts crystal size distributions reveal high differentiation rate, thus suggesting that such a sill-like magmatic system is capable of evolving in a very short time and erupting suddenly with only short-term warning.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive major and trace element data for {\~{}} 130 abyssal peridotite samples from the Pacific and Indian ocean ridge-transforms systems. The data reveal important features about the petrogenesis of these rocks, mantle melting and melt extraction processes beneath ocean ridges, and elemental behaviours. While abyssal peridotite are serpentinized and have also experienced seafloor weathering, magmatic signatures remain well preserved in the bulk-rock compositions. The better inverse correlation of MgO with progressively heavier rare earth elements (REEs) reflects varying amounts of melt depletion. This melt depletion may result from recent sub-ridge mantle melting, but could also be inherited from fertile source histories. Light REEs in bulk-rock samples are more enriched, not more depleted, than in the constituent clinopyroxene (cpx) of the same sample suites previously studied. If the cpx light REEs record sub-ridge mantle melting processes, then the bulk-rock light REEs must reflect post-melting refertilization. The significant correlations of light REEs (e.g., La, Ce, Pr, Nd) with immobile high field strength elements (HFSEs, e.g., Nb and Zr) suggest that enrichments of both light REEs and HFSEs resulted from a common magmatic process. The refertilization takes place in the “cold” thermal boundary layer (TBL) beneath ridges where the ascending melts migrate through and interact with the advanced residues. The refertilization apparently did not affect cpx relics analyzed for trace elements. This observation suggests grain-boundary porous melt migration in the TBL. The ascending melts may not be thermally “reactive”, and thus may have only affected cpx rims, which, together with precipitated olivine, entrapped melt, and the rest of the rock, were subsequently serpentinized. The very large variations in bulk-rock Zr/Hf and Nb/Ta ratios are unexpected. The correlation between the two ratios is consistent with the observations in basalts that DZr/DHf {\textless}1 and DNb/DTa {\textless}1. Given the identical charges (5+ for Nb and Ta; 4+ for Zr and Hf) and essentially the same ionic radii (RNb/RTa = 1.000 and RZr/RHf = 1.006 {\~{}} 1.026), yet a factor of {\~{}} 2 mass differences (MZr/MHf = 0.511 and MNb/MTa = 0.513), it is hypothesized that mass-dependent Ds or diffusion/mass-transfer rates may be important in causing elemental fractionations during porous melt ascent in the TBL. It is also possible that some “exotic” phases with highly fractionated Zr/Hf and Nb/Ta ratios may exist in these rocks, thus having “nugget” effects on the bulk-rock analyses. All these hypotheses need testing by constraining the storage and distributions of all the incompatible trace elements. As serpentine contains up to 13 wt {\%} H2O, and is stable up to 7 GPa before transformed to dense hydrous magnesium silicate phases that are stable at pressures of {\~{}} 5 to 50 GPa, it is possible that the serpentinized peridotites may survive, at least partly, subduction-zone dehydration, and transport large amounts of H2O (also Ba, Rb, Cs, K, U, Sr, Pb etc. with elevated U/Pb ratios) into the deep mantle. The latter may contribute to the HIMU component in the source regions of oceanic basalts.},

Based on the composition of coexisting aegirines and Ti-minerals it is suggested that the formation of Mg-NAT is favoured by high f O2 and high Nds- and TiO2-activity. The instability of ilmenite at a late magmatic stage leads to the breakdown of a peralkaline acmite-ilmenite oxygen-buffer. Lack of buffering results in strong enrichment of aegirines in Fe2+-NAT. Up to 8{\%} TiO2 and 20{\%} Mg-NAT and 20{\%} Fe2+-NAT is recorded from these aegirines. The most evolved compositions show decreasing NAT and increasing Ac. The breakdown of sphene at a late magmatic to subsolidus stage results in increasing Wo in coexisting aegirines. Based on comparison with other occurrences it is concluded that NAT endmembers form at low pressure, but not necessarilly at low T., and that high f O2 favors Mg-NAT formation and low f O2 Fe2+-NAT formation.},

abstract = {The saturation surface of pseudobrookite (Fe2TiO5) was determined for melts in the system SiO2-Al2O3-K2O-FeO-Fe2O3-TiO2 at 1400° C and 1 atm. The variation in concentrations of Fe2O3, TiO2 and Fe2TiO5 in liquids can be used to infer relative changes in activity coefficients of these components with changing K2O/(K2O+Al2O3) of the melts. Saturation concentrations of these components are low and relatively constant in the peraluminous melts and increase with increasing K2O/(K2O+Al2O3) in peralkaline liquids. The activity coefficients of Fe2O3 and TiO2 and Fe2TiO5, therefore, are higher in peraluminous liquids than in peralkaline liquids in this system. In addition, the iron redox ratio was measured as a function of K2O/(K2O+Al2O3) for liquids just below the saturation surface; fO2f{\_}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}O{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}2{\}}{\}} {\}} was fixed so all variations in redox ratio are entirely due to changes in melt composition. The redox ratio from unsaturated liquids was applied to saturated liquids where redox analysis of the glass is impossible. The homogeneous equilibrium experiments indicate that the activity coefficient of Fe2O3 relative to that of FeO is significantly greater in peraluminous melts than peralkaline melts. Both the heterogeneous and homogeneous equilibria suggest that in peralkaline liquids K+in excess of that required to charge balance tetrahedral Al+3 is used to stabilize both Fe+3 and Ti+4. Calculations show that ferric iron and titanium compete equally effectively for charge-balancing potassium but neither can outcompete aluminum. The observed changes in solution properties of Fe2O3 and TiO2 in the synthetic melts are used to explain variations in Fe-Ti oxide stabilities in natural peraluminous and peralkaline rhyolites and granites. Since the activity coefficients of both ferric iron and titanium are significantly higher in peraluminous liquids than in peralkaline liquids, Fe-Ti oxides should occur earlier in the crystallization sequence in peraluminous rhyolites than in peralkaline rhyolites. In addition, iron will be reduced in peraluminous granites and rhyolites relative to peralkaline ones under comparable P, T, and fO2f{\_}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}O{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}2{\}}{\}} {\}} . Finally, observed crystallization patterns for minerals containing highly charged cations other than ferric iron and titanium are evaluated in the context of this and other experimental studies.},

abstract = {Ratios of elements with similar incompatibilities in the mantle can be used to characterize magma sources through time. Nb/Y and Zr/Y distributions in oceanic basalts support the existence of a long-lived, deep depleted source in mantle. Zr/Y, Nb/Y, Zr/Nb, and Nb/Th ratios in oceanic basalts and komatiites suggest that depleted and recycled components, together probably with an enriched component, were present in the deep mantle by 3.5 Ga. Low Zr/Nb and Hf/Sm ratios and high La/Yb and Nb/Y ratios in some plume basalts and Al-depleted komatiites may reflect majorite fractionation. High Zr/Nb ratios and low Nb/Y ratios in Archean Al-undepleted komatiites may record partial melting of a Mg-perovskite source in deep mantle plumes in which Mg-perovskite crystallizes and accumulates in komatiite melts during ascent. Oceanic greenstone basalts show a gradual increase in the Nb/Th ratio with time with a relatively sudden increase at about 2 Ga. This trend is consistent with gradual continental growth and with a major episode of continental growth at 2.7 Ga. Nb/Th ratios in some Early Archean basalts may record extraction of up to 25{\%} of the present volume of continental crust from the early upper mantle. An alternative explanation for the rapid increase in Nb/Th in oceanic basalts at 2 Ga is that a catastrophic 2.7-Ga event in the mantle changed the composition or/and location of the primary volume of mantle from which continental crust was extracted.},

abstract = {One metamorphic and four magmatic aegirines, together with two end-member aegirines synthesized at atmospheric pressure and different temperatures, were investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The limited compositional differences allow the polyhedral volumes to be almost constant in all the aegirines investigated (VM1 ≈ 11.0 {\AA}3; VM2 ≈ 26.3 {\AA}3; VT ≈ 2.21 {\AA}3). However, differences in polyhedral distortions are responsible for the cell-volume variations, reflected mainly in the change of a and $\beta$ cell parameters. Cell volume is only partly related to the composition of these aegirines: with increasing formation temperature, an increase in the unit-cell volume of {\~{}}1.2 {\AA}3 is observed, while a significant contraction of the cell volume occurs during high-pressure formation. As the difference in cell volume between the two synthetic aegirines is ascribed to the different conditions of synthesis temperature, the same interpretation could be adopted for the differences observed in natural aegirines.},

abstract = {We report the first 39Ar-40Ar ages from the three early basic shield-like massifs of Tenerife, Canary islands, and couple these with detailed major and trace element chemistry to constrain the nature and timing of the mantle melting processes. The massifs have chemically different sources, and independent evolutionary histories. The Teno and Roque del Conde massifs appear chemically to represent the products of single mantle melting cycles, with progressive decrease in mean melt fraction and increase in mean melting depth in younger rocks. The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0-6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar-40Ar ages ranging from 8.0-4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599-626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6-7{\%}. The fractionation sequence is olivine-clinopyroxene-magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Marti, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089-1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction.},

abstract = {The Himalayan Mianning-Dechang REE belt, western Sichuan, SW China, is approximately 270 km long and 15 km wide, and contains total reserves of {\textgreater} 3 Mt of LREE, including one giant (Maoniuping), one large (Dalucao) and a number of small-medium REE deposits (Muluozhai, Lizhuang) and occurrences. The belt is tectonically located within a continental collision zone, i.e., the eastern Indo-Asian collision zone. REE mineralization is associated with Himalayan carbonatite-alkaline complexes, which consist of carbonatitic sills or dykes and associated alkaline syenite stocks. Available dating data define a Himalayan metallogenic epoch (40-10 Ma). The magmatic-hydrothermal REE systems were controlled by Cenozoic large-scale strike-slip faulting and the resultant tensional fissure zones, developed in a transform phase from a transpressional to a transtensional regime. Alteration is characterized by fenitization, which formed fenite halos enveloping the REE orebodies. Associated REE mineralization occurs as complex vein systems consisting of various veinlets, stringer and stockwork zones, and breccia-pipe systems. The REE orebodies show various shapes from plate-like, lenticular to pipe-like in different districts. Ore types are dominated by pegmatitic, carbonatitic, breccia, and stringer (stockwork), and disseminated ores, mainly composed of barite + fluorite + aegirine-augite + calcite + bastnaesite assemblages. Bastnaesite precipitation (275-325 °C) appears in three assemblages: early clastics-bearing barite + arfvedsonite + calcite + bastnaesite; intermediate quartz + fluorite + barite + bastnaesite; and late fluorite + barite + bastnaesite assemblages. These were followed by low-temperature pyrite + galena + sphalerite assemblages. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that gangue quartz and fluorite hosts numerous melt/fluid inclusions with a large proportion of sulfate (i.e., BaSO4, K2SO4, and CaSO4), in addition to CaCO3and CaF2, yielding abnormally high (up to 750 °C) but wide-ranging homogenization temperatures (750-125 °C). The similarity of Sr-Nd isotopic compositions for gangue minerals with those of the host carbonatite-syenite suggests that ore-forming fluids, especially the F-, HCO32-, SO42-components, were derived from carbonatite-syenite magmas. The O-D-C isotopic data from gangue calcite, fluorite and quartz indicate that the fluids were of orthomagmatic origin, but also involved mixing with an external fluid. On the basis of our synthesis, we propose a possible genetic model for REE mineralization, in which the hydrothermal system temporally underwent a complicated evolution from separation of high-T sulfate-bearing NaCl-KCl brine resulting in effective precipitation of REE-fluorocarbonate and sulfate, to subsequent mixing with low-temperature meteoric water precipitating minor sulfide assemblages. Spatially, this sequence of events generated a three-tier REE mineralized architecture, in which pipe-like breccia orebodies grade downwards from shallow to deep structural levels into large veinlet ore systems, and veinlet-disseminated orebodies. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {The noble gases are geochemical tracers 'par excellence' in that they are chemically inert, highly incompatible during mantle melting, so are depleted in the silicate Earth, and wide ranging in their isotopic characteristics giving clear indications of their origins and provenance in various terrestrial reservoirs. This chapter presents an update on the utility of noble gases as tracers of mantle processes, starting with a thorough review of advances in our understanding of noble gas behavior under mantle conditions. This is followed by focusing on the systematics of all five noble gases in a variety of mantle-derived materials, including mid-ocean ridge and ocean island lavas, paying particular attention to the published record of the past decade. These results are discussed in the context of three key themes of mantle evolution: recycling of material between exospheric and internal reservoirs via subduction zones, the significance of high helium isotope signatures with respect to primitive/depleted sources within the mantle, including their locations and mixing properties, and finally the case of low helium isotope signatures and the origin and significance of high-??

abstract = {The rover Spirit has now performed a series of whole-rock chemical analyses on rock outcrops and boulders along its traverse across the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. The wide-spread consensus that the Columbia Hills represent a mafic volcanic pyroclastic sequence has problems, however, explaining the compositional variation observed within the Columbia Hills analyses. The positive trend in Fe-Mg space exhibited by the rocks of the Columbia Hills contrasts markedly with volcanic trends controlled by crystal fractionation and no plausible crystal fractionation scheme can explain the co-variation of Fe and Mg, if the analyzed rocks are assumed to represent volcanic compositions defining a liquid line of descent.Positive arrays in Fe-Mg space are, however, common features in whole-rock data collected across cyclically-layered igneous intrusions. The repeated alteration of feldspar-rich versus mafic-rich cumulates in such intrusions results in whole-rock compositions that scatter along mixing lines between feldspar, near the origin, and the mafic cumulate phases, reflecting the magmatic sorting of cumulus crystals as opposed to crystal-liquid equilibria. There is a striking correspondence between the Fe-Mg trends observed in the Columbia Hills data and the cumulate stratigraphy of a number of terrestrial layered intrusions. This raises the possibility that stratification seen at many localities along Spirit's traverse may reflect magmatic sedimentation in a large layered igneous intrusion. According to this interpretation, the most magnesium rocks are harzburgite to olivine norite cumulates without cumulus magnetite. The majority of the rocks of the Columbia Hills, however, appear to be olivine norites to gabbronorites with cumulus magnetite, which are characterized by variable proportions of feldspar versus mafic silicates plus magnetite. Furthermore, phosphorus-rich rocks, which have previously been interpreted to be alkaline basalts, are better explained as leucocratic norites with cumulus apatite. The sequence of crystallization of the magma responsible for the Columbia Hills is therefore interpreted to be: olivine, followed by orthopyroxene and plagioclase, then magnetite, and finally apatite. Ca-rich clinopyroxene appears to have been a late post-cumulus phase. If this interpretation is correct, then the Columbia Hills likely represent a Noachian-age layered intrusion that was exhumed by rebound following the meteorite impact that formed Gusev crater in the Hesperian. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The partitioning of a number of trace elements (LILE, HFSE, REE, Cu, Pb, Co, Ni) between mantle minerals (olivine, pyroxenes and garnet) and silico-carbonate melts was experimentally studied at 6-12GPa and 1300-1700??C. The starting compositions were model kimberlitic with {\~{}}30wt.{\%} SiO2, which differentiated to carbonatite-like melts with {\textless}10wt.{\%} SiO2 depending on the degree of crystallization. The melts were rich in CO2 (up to {\~{}}30wt.{\%}) and contained 0 to 30wt.{\%} H2O. Trace elements were added to the starting mixtures to levels of {\~{}}100ppm. They were analyzed by LA ICP MS in the products of 18 experiments. The partition coefficients of Ba, La, Ta, and Nb are very low for all phases ({\textless}0.01). These elements are especially susceptible to contamination in the experimental products. We suspect that some relatively high values obtained for these elements in previous studies are overestimated. Generally, the partition coefficients (Ds/l) of the moderately incompatible and compatible elements increase in the sequence olivine-low-Ca pyroxene-high-Ca pyroxene. Garnet shows maximum fractionation of the trace elements, such that D values for the highly incompatible elements are lower than those for pyroxenes and highest for the HREE, Sc, and V. The partition coefficients of a number of incompatible elements are rather insensitive to pressure, temperature, and melt composition. There is no correlation between the partition coefficients and the content of H2O, CO2 and the overall content of trace elements. They are predominantly controlled by the composition of the crystalline phases. In particular, garnet-liquid partitioning is very sensitive to Ca in garnet, and pyroxene-liquid partitioning to Al in pyroxene.The comparison of the obtained partition coefficients with the compositions of likely kimberlite magmas shows that depleted and refertilized harzburgite from the continental lithospheric mantle is a viable candidate as the source material of kimberlites. The estimation of trace element characteristics of near-solidus mantle melts indicates that the most reliable indicator of carbonate melt metasomatism is depletion of Zr and Hf relative to Sm and Nd. Criteria based on the ratios of more incompatible elements (e.g. Nb/La) are very sensitive to the melting conditions and can be misleading. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phase diagrams of hydrous mid-ocean ridge (MOR) basalts to 330 km depth and of hydrous peridotites to 250 km depth are compiled for conditions characteristic for subduction zones. A synthesis of our experimentally determined phase relations of chlorite, lawsonite, epidote-zoisite, amphibole, paragonite, chloritoid, talc, and phengite in basalts and of phase relations from the literature of serpentine, talc, chlorite, amphibole, and phase A in ultramafics permits calculation of H2O contents in hydrous phase assemblages that occur in natural compositions. This yields the information necessary to calculate water budgets for descending slabs. Starting from low-grade blueschist conditions (10–20 km depth) with H2O contents between 5 and 6 wt{\%} for hydrated oceanic crust, complete dehydration is achieved between 70 and {\textgreater}300 km depth as a function of individual slab geotherms. Hydrous phases which decompose at depth below volcanic arcs are lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, and talc (± phengite) in mafic compositions and chlorite and serpentine in peridotite. Approximately 15–35{\%} of the initially subducted H2O are released below volcanic arcs. The contribution of amphibole dehydration to the water budget is small (5–20{\%}) and occurs at relatively shallow depth (65–90 km). In any predicted thermal structure, dehydration is a combination of a stepwise and a continuous process through many different reactions which occur simultaneously in the different portions of the descending slab. Such a dehydration characteristic is incompatible with `single phase dehydration models' which focus fluid flow through a unique major dehydration event in order to explain volcanic fronts. As a consequence of continuously progressing dehydration, water ascending from the slab will be generally available to depth of ca. 150–200 km. The fluid rising from the subducting lithosphere will cause partial melting in the hot portion of the mantle wedge. We propose that the volcanic front simply forms above the mantle wedge isotherm where the extent of melting is sufficient to allow for the mechanical extraction of parental arc magmas. Thermal models show that such an isotherm (ca. 1300°C) locates below volcanic fronts, slab surface depths below such an isotherm are compatible with the observed depths of the slab surface below volcanic fronts.},

@article{Rehr1992,
abstract = {The French Massif Central (FMC) represents the whole West European Variscan (WEV) belt, in terms of both the geodynamic evolution and the metallic content. Thus, a study of the metallogenic evolution of the FMC may elucidate the conditions that allow the mineralisation of a collision belt, since recent collision belts, e.g. the Himalayas or the Alps show that mineralisation does not necessarily result from the collision process. The Palaeozoic history of the FMC is divided into three geodynamic stages unevenly involved from the metallogenic view point. The Eo-Variscan stage (Cambrian to Silurian) was not important; the Meso-Variscan stage (Devonian-Early Carboniferous) was of limited importance; and most of the mineralisations formed during the Neo-Variscan stage (Late Carboniferous-Early Permian). In addition, some more mineralisation was produced during the Mesozoic because of the thermal reactivation linked with the Alpine orogenies. The Eo-Variscan stage (Cambrian-Silurian) corresponded to the pre-collision history, marked at the WEV belt scale by a fragmentation of the northern Gondwana (immature crust evolved from the Late Proterozoic Cadomian orogeny), up to the break-up of the crust and the formation of oceanic basins (Cambrian-Ordovician), followed by their resorption by subduction during the Silurian. In the FMC, no subduction-related magmatism is known (being rare at the WEV belt scale), and consequently subduction-related mineralisation, e.g. porphyry copper, is unknown in the WEV belt. Although some ophiolitic remnants are known, they never display Cyprus-type VMS deposits, nor massive podiform chromitites. Beside platformal sedimentary deposits on passive margins, the only deposits formed during the Eo-Variscan stage were of the SEDEX type, linked with the early rifting of the Gondwanian crust. The Meso-Variscan stage (Devonian-Early Carboniferous) corresponded to the collision proper, with the formation of crustal-scale nappe structures and the intrusion of collision-related peraluminous granites. Although these granites were enriched in rare metals they did not yield significant hydrothermal mineralisation, due to the great depth of their emplacement, as the similar granites in the Himalayas. However, they were a source of rare metals (in particular, uranium) for later mineralisation events. At the WEV belt scale Devonian distensive events are coeval with the collision. They were recorded by the formation of sedimentary basins of limited time and space extent, corresponding to the splitting of the continental crust (up to formation of oceanic domains in many cases), and were characterised by a bi-modal (“spilite-keratophyre”) volcanism. These basins formed in transtensional (or pull-apart) settings along major strike-slip faults, a peculiarity of the Variscan collision belt (which may conveniently be described as a “strike-slip orogen”). In such basins, many deposits linked with the volcanic thermal energy were formed: SEDEX deposits of the Meggen-type, iron deposits of the Lahn-Dill-type and VMS base metal deposits, the latter being the only ones known in the FMC (Br{\'{e}}venne deposits). The Neo-Variscan stage corresponded to the “hypercollision” and was characterised by a shift from compressional tectonics (late thickening of the crust during the Sudetian event and long-lasting dextral strike-slip tectonics along NW-SE to NE-SW fault zones) towards extensional tectonics (“basin and range” of the Late Stephanian-Early Permian), as well as by high heat flows, recorded by LP-HT metamorphism, extensive granitisation and granulitisation of the lower crust. These characteristics record the development of a lithospheric delamination process. In response to the energetic input released by this process, numerous hydrothermal deposits were formed in the FMC, as well as in the whole WEV belt, during the Neo-Variscan stage. These are mainly: (1) high-temperature granite-centered tungsten deposits, mainly associated with cordierite-bearing high level intrusions of Namurian-Westphalian age; (2) rare metal granites (and the associated hydrothermal tin mineralisations), resulting from fluid-induced low-degree partial melting of the middle crust in relation with the devolatilisation of the granulitised lower crust; (3) shear-zone hosted gold and antimony deposits, related to crustal-scale hydrothermal circulation, triggered by the transition to extensional tectonics at about 300 Ma; and (4) uranium deposition in extensional settings related to the Early Permian distension. The Post-Variscan mineralising events recorded the renewal of thermal flows in the lithosphere linked with early Alpine events (mainly the Trias-Lias distension in the Tethyan realm and the middle Cretaceous opening of the Bay of Biscay in the Pyrenean realm). They resulted in low-enthalpy geothermal systems, leading to a variety of deposits, mainly: (1) F-Ba districts, reworking F and Ba from Late Variscan granites and ignimbrites; (2) a major uranium deposit (Lod{\`{e}}ve), reworking uranium from the Permian Lod{\`{e}}ve basin; and (3) Zn-Pb districts of the MVT-type. Finally, the mineralisation of the Variscan collision belt is mainly the consequence of the Neo-Variscan lithospheric delamination process. By contrast, the absence of such a process in collision belts like the Himalayas or the Alps is the key of them being devoid of mineralisation. It appears that the mechanical energy released by the collision itself is not sufficient to mobilise and concentrate the trace elements involved in the metallogenic processes.},

abstract = {The southeastern margin of the anorthositic Kunene Intrusive Complex, NW Namibia, has been subsequently invaded by Mesoproterozoic syenite, nepheline syenite and ferrocarbonatite dykes along NE- and SE-trending faults. The first generation of carbonatite intrusions frequently contains fenitized anorthositic wall-rock fragments set in a ferrocarbonatite matrix; later, subordinate veins of massive ferrocarbonatite are almost xenolith-free and cut through the main carbonatite dykes. A mantle source for both carbonatite generations is constrained by their respective oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of ankerite ({\{}delta{\}}18OSMOW 8{\{}middle dot{\}}91-9{\{}middle dot{\}}73{\{}per thousand{\}}; {\{}delta{\}}13CPDB -6{\{}middle dot{\}}98 to -6{\{}middle dot{\}}76{\{}per thousand{\}}). Na-rich fluids, released from the melt parental to the ferrocarbonatites, caused the fenitization of both the incorporated anorthosite xenoliths and the bordering anorthosite, syenite and nepheline syenite. This process is mainly characterized by the progressive transformation of Ca-rich plagioclase, K-feldspar and nepheline into albite and/or sodalite. The changing mineral modes indicate that the fenitizing fluids were sodium-rich and strongly Si-deficient solutions, which also contained significant amounts of Sr, Ba, Nb and the light rare earth elements. On the basis of mineral equilibria studies, it is possible to reconstruct the temperature conditions for carbonatite emplacement (c. 830 {\{}+/-{\}} 200{\{}degrees{\}}C) and recrystallization (c. 480 {\{}+/-{\}} 130{\{}degrees{\}}C), and for the metasomatic formation of sodalite (c. 700 {\{}+/-{\}} 70{\{}degrees{\}}C).},

abstract = {Barium, lanthanum, ytterbium, and yttrium partitioning experiments between fluid-saturated haplogranitic melts and aqueous solutions were conducted at 750 to 950 °C and 0.2 to 1 GPa to investigate the effects of melt and fluid composition, pressure, and temperature. Partition coefficients were determined using different experimental methods. On one hand quenched experiments were performed, and on the other hand, trace element contents in the aqueous fluid were determined directly using a hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis of K-lines. The latter required a high excitation energy of 50 keV due to the high energies necessary to excite the K-lines of the studied elements. The data from these two techniques showed good agreement for chloridic solutions, whereas quenching had a significant effect on results of the experiments with only water in the case of Ba. In Cl-free experiments, lanthanum and yttrium, trace element contents were even below detection limit in the quenched fluids, whereas small concentrations were detected in comparable in-situ experiments. This distinct difference is likely due to back reactions between fluid and melt upon cooling.

The partitioning data of all elements show no dependence on the temperature and only small dependence on pressure. In contrast, the partitioning is strongly influenced by the composition of the starting fluid and melt. For chloridic fluids, there was a sharp increase in the Ba, La, Y and Yb partition coefficients with the alumina saturation index (ASI). The Ba partition coefficient increased from 0.002 at an ASI of 0.8 to 0.55 at an ASI of 1.07. At higher ASI, it decreased slightly to 0.2 at an ASI of ∼ 1.3. Likewise, it was one to two orders of magnitude higher in chloridic fluids compared to those found in H2O experiments. Fluid–melt partition coefficients of La and Y increased from 0.002 at an ASI of ∼ 0.8 to ∼ 0.1 at an ASI of 1.2. In the same ASI range, the Yb partition coefficient increased to a maximum value of 0.02. Even at high salinities all elements fractionate into the melt. The compositional dependence of the partitioning data imply that both melt composition and fluid composition have a strong influence on trace element behavior and that complexation of Ba, REE and Y tin the fluid is not only controlled by the presence of Cl− in the fluid. Instead, interaction of these elements with major melt components dissolved in the fluid is very likely.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal experiments were carried out at 2 kbar water pressure, 700 °–800 ° C, with the objective of determining the level of dissolved Zr required for precipitation of zircon from melts in the system SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O. The saturation level depends strongly upon molar (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 of the melts, with remarkably little sensitivity to temperature, SiO2 concentration, or melt Na2O/ K2O. For peraluminous melts and melts lying in the quartz-orthoclase-albite composition plane, less than 100 ppm Zr is required for zircon saturation. In peralkaline melts, however, zircon solubility shows pronounced, apparently linear, dependence upon (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3, with the amount of dissolvable Zr ranging up to 3.9 wt.{\%} at (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 = 2.0. Small amounts (1 wt.{\%} each) of dissolved CaO and Fe2O3 cause a 25{\%} relative reduction of zircon solubility in peralkaline melts. The main conclusion regarding zirconium/zircon behavior in nature is that any felsic, non-peralkaline magma is likely to contain zircon crystals, because the saturation level is so low for these compositions. Zircon fractionation, and its consequences to REE, Th, and Ta abundances must, therefore, be considered in modelling the evolution of these magmas. Partial melting in any region of the Earth's crust that contains more than ∼ 100 ppm Zr will produce granitic magmas whose Zr contents are buffered at constant low ({\textless} 100 ppm) values; unmelted zircon in the residual rock of such a melting event will impart to the residue a characteristic U- or V-shaped REE abundance pattern. In peralkaline, felsic magmas such as those that form pantellerites and comendites, extreme Zr (and REE, Ta) enrichment is possible because the feldspar fractionation that produces these magmas from non-peralkaline predecessors does not drive the melt toward saturation in zircon. Zircon solubility in felsic melts appears to be controlled by the formation of alkali-zirconosilicate complexes of simple (2:1) alkali oxide: ZrO2 stoichiometry.},

abstract = {Many carbonatites are associated both spatially and temporally with large igneous provinces (LIPs), and considered to originate from a mantle plume source lacking any contribution from recycled crustal materials. Here, we report an occurrence of carbonatite enriched in rare-earth elements (REE) and associated with the Tarim LIP in northwestern China. The Tarim LIP comprises intrusive and volcanic products of mantle plume activity spanning from {\~{}} 300 to 280 Ma. The carbonatites at Wajilitage in the northwestern part of Tarim are dominated by calcite and dolomite varieties, and contain abundant REE minerals (principally, monazite and REE-fluorcarbonates). Th–Pb age determination of monazite yielded an emplacement age of 266 ± 5.3 Ma, i.e. appreciably younger than the eruption age of flood basalts at {\~{}} 290 Ma. The carbonatites show low initial87Sr/86Sr (0.7037–0.7041) and high $\epsilon$Nd(t)(1.2–4) values, which depart from the isotopic characteristics of plume-derived basalts and high-Mg picrites from the same area. This indicates that the Wajilitage carbonatites derived from a mantle source isotopically distinct from the one responsible for the voluminous (ultra)mafic volcanism at Tarim. The carbonatites show $\delta$26MgDSM3values (− 0.99 to − 0.65‰) that are significantly lower than those in typical mantle-derived rocks and rift carbonatites, but close to marine sediments and orogenic carbonatites. We propose that the carbonatites in the Tarim LIP formed by decompressional melting of recycled sediments mixed with the ambient mantle peridotite. The enriched components in the Tarim plume could be accounted for by the presence of recycled sedimentary components in the subcontinental mantle.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces form with massive flood basalts being erupted over a large region within a few million years. A prevailing model for their formation is a mantle plume model in which a plume head originates from the core–mantle boundary, ascends through the mantle, and produces topographic uplift and eventually massive melting at the surface. However, many geological observations indicate surface subsidence in the central region before or during flood basalt eruptions. In this study, we demonstrate that a plume head temporarily ponding below the 660-km phase change boundary causes significant subsidence at the Earth's surface over an extended period before the eruption, and that the loading from erupted basalts causes surface subsidence at the periphery of the eruption area that affects the environment for subsequent episodes of basalt eruptions. Our studies therefore demonstrate that the observed subsidence history in many flood basalt provinces is characteristic of the dynamics of mantle plumes and may be used as diagnostics for identifying plume-induced flood basalt events.},

Later, closed system fractionation produced nepheline-bearing assemblages with aSiO2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}4 and log fO2 = FMQ – 3 to FMQ – 5. Assimilation of wall rocks produced local variations of melt composition. Four traverses through the unit were sampled parallel to the assumed direction of crystallization.

abstract = {Teide Volcano has many different meanings: For the Guanche aborigines, who endured several of its eruptions, it was Echeide (Hell). Early navigators had in Teide, a lifesaving widely visible landmark that was towering over the clouds. For the first explorers, Teide was a challenging and dangerous climb, since it was thought that Teide's peak was so high that from its summit the sun was too close and far too hot to survive. Teide was considered the highest mountain in the world at that time and measuring its height precisely was a great undertaking and at the time of global scientific significance. For von Buch, von Humboldt, Lyell and other great 18th and19th century naturalists, Teide helped to shape a new and now increasingly 'volcanic' picture, where the origin of volcanic rocks (from solidified magma) slowly casted aside Neptunism and removed some of the last barriers for the development of modern Geology and Volcanology as the sciences we know today. For the present day population of Tenerife, living on top of the world's third tallest volcanic structure on the planet, Teide has actually become "Padre Teide", a fatherly protector and an emblematic icon of Tenerife, not to say of the Canaries as a whole. The UNESCO acknowledged this iconic and complex volcano, as "of global importance in providing evidence of the geological processes that underpin the evolution of oceanic islands". Today, 'Teide National Park' boasts 4 Million annual visitors including many 'volcano spotters' and is a spectacular natural environment which most keep as an impression to treasure and to never forget. For us, the editors of this book, Teide is all of the above; a 'hell of a job', a navigation point on cloudy days, a challenge beyond imagination, a breakthrough in our understanding of oceanic volcanism that has shaped our way of thinking about volcanoes, and lastly, Teide provides us with a reference point from where to start exploring other oceanic volcanoes in the Canaries and beyond. Here we have compiled the different aspects and the current understanding of this natural wonder.},

abstract = {North Motzfeldt is an intrusive igneous centre within the Igaliku (formerly spelt Igaliko) complex, Gardar Province, South Greenland. A detailed field description of the centre is given, with preliminary geochemical and isotopic data. The North Motzfeldt centre is intruded into Ketilidian granitoid basement rocks, and current exposure retains parts of the original roof against earlier Gardar eruptives and elastic sediments of the Eriksfjord formation. The unconformity between the Ketilidian and the overlying Eriksfjord is believed to have been crucial in the siting of the centre. The centre is subdivided into two major units, NM1 and NM2. This was followed by significant peralkaline nepheline microsyenite in sheets, characterized by rare element-rich accessory minerals including rinkite-m{\~{A}}¸andrite, pyrochlore and l{\~{A}}¥venite. A significant microsyenite body is called NM3. A preliminary Rb-Sr isochron of 1226{\^{A}}±27 Ma indicates a far younger age for the centre than previously thought ({\^{a}}ˆ¼ 1350 Ma). Cross-cutting relationships between North Motzfeldt and rocks of the adjacent Motzfeldt centre require a reappraisal of the chronology of Motzfeldt magmatism. We suggest that rocks previously believed to comprise the Motzfeldt centre represent the products of multiple phases of magmatism from Early- to Mid-Gardar times.},

With increasing fluorine content the position of the quartz-alkali feldspar field boundary moves away from the quartz apex. The position of the minimum melting composition and the minimum liquidus temperature change progressively from Qz37Ab34Or29 and 730{\~{}} for the fluorine free system (Tuttle and Bowen 1958) to QzasAb58Or27 and 630 {\~{}} C for the system with 4 wt.{\%} added fluorine. Exploratory experiments have been carried out below the liquidus, and have indicated that for certain bulk compositions an assemblage consisting of two alkali feldspars, quartz, melt and vapour can exist at temperatures as low as 550{\~{}} at 1 kb. The experimental results suggest that there may be an interaction between fluorine and aluminosilicate complexes present within the melt, to produce aluminofluoride (A1F63-) complex anions (Manning et al. 1980). The observed changes in liquidus phase relationships with increasing fluorine content indicate that the compositions of certain fluorine-rich granitic rocks are consistent with an origin by crystallisation of residual melts enriched in fluorine by magmatic differentiation. Such residual melts may exist at relatively low temperatures, and may form part of a continuum between granite magmatism and associated hydro-thermal activity. Because of the observed preference of fluorine for aluminosilicate phases at the magmatic stage, the presence of fluorine alone is not considered to play a direct part in the generation of residual mineralising hydrothermal fluids.},

The effects of increasing the concentration of dissolved H2O on the major element compositions of melts in equilibrium with a spinel lherzolite mineral assemblage are to decrease the concentrations of SiO2, FeO, MgO, and CaO. The concentration of Al2O3 is unaffected. The lower SiO2 contents of the hydrous melts result from an increase in the activity coefficient for SiO2 with increasing dissolved H2O. The lower concentrations of FeO and MgO result from the lower temperatures at which H2O-bearing melts coexist with mantle minerals as compared to anhydrous melts. These compositional changes produce an elevated SiO2/(MgO+FeO) ratio in hydrous peridotite partial melts, making them relatively SiO2 rich when compared to anhydrous melts on a volatile-free basis. Hydrous peridotite melting reactions are affected primarily by the lowered mantle solidus. Temperature-induced compositional variations in coexisting pyroxenes lower the proportion of clinopyroxene entering the melt relative to orthopyroxene. Isobaric batch melting calculations indicate that fluid-undersaturated peridotite melting is characterized by significantly lower melt productivity than anhydrous peridotite melting, and that the peridotite melting process in subduction zones is strongly influenced by the composition of the H2O-rich component introduced into the mantle wedge from the subducted slab.},

XANES spectra of basaltic samples from the Galapagos spreading center, the Juan de Fuca ridge and the Lau Basin showed a dominant broad peak at 2476.8 eV, similar to the spectra obtained from synthetic sulfide-saturated basalts and pyrrhotite. An additional sharp peak at 2469.8 eV, similar to that of crystalline sulfides, was present in synthetic glasses quenched from hydrous melts but absent in anhydrous glasses and may indicate differences in sulfide species with hydration or presence of minute sulfide inclusions exsolved during quenching. The XANES spectra of a basalt from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, and absarokitic basalts from the Cascades Range, Oregon, USA, showed a sharp peak at 2482.8 eV, characteristic of synthetic sulfate-saturated basaltic glasses and crystalline sulfate-bearing minerals such as hauyne. Basaltic samples from the Lamont Seamount, the early submarine phase of Kilauea volcano and the Loihi Seamount showed unequivocal evidence of the coexistence of S2− and S6+ species, emphasizing the relevance of S6+ to these systems. XANES spectra of basaltic glasses synthesized in internally-heated pressure vessels and equilibrated at fO2 ranging from FMQ − 1.4 to FMQ + 2.7 showed systematic changes in the features related to S2− and S6+ with changes in fO2. No significant features related to sulfite (S4+) species were observed. These results were used to construct a function that allows estimates of S6+/$\Sigma$S from XANES data. Comparison of S6+/$\Sigma$S data obtained by S K$\alpha$ shifts measured with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), S6+/$\Sigma$S obtained from XANES spectra, and theoretical considerations show that data obtained from EPMA measurements underestimate S6+/$\Sigma$S in samples that are sulfate-dominated (most likely because of photo-reduction effects during analysis) whereas S6+/$\Sigma$S from XANES provide a close match to the expected theoretical values. The XANES-derived relationship for S6+/$\Sigma$S as a function of fO2 indicates that the transition from S2− to S6− with increasing fO2 occurs over a narrower interval than what is predicted by the EPMA-derived relationship. The implications for natural systems is that small variation of fO2 above FMQ + 1 will have a large effect on S behavior in basaltic systems, in particular regarding the amount of S that can be transported by basaltic melts before sulfide saturation can occur.},

abstract = {The formation of peralkaline melts is generally recognized to be related to enrichment of the mantle in sodium or potassium during a metasomatic event that predated magma generation. The wide range in mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, and fluid compositions in peralkaline melts are, to a large extent, a function of the sodium/potassium content of these mantle-metasomatizing fluids, which also governs redox conditions. We propose that sodic fluids will reduce the mantle assemblage by depleting ferric iron from garnet to form the aegirine component in pyroxene. In contrast, potassic fluids would oxidize the mantle assemblage by extracting Al2O3 from the garnet to make phlogopite. We suggest that during differentiation of peralkaline melts, once Fe–Ti oxides have been depleted from the assemblage, simple crystallization reactions of common solid phases such as aegirine or arfvedsonite control the oxygen fugacity by equilibria such as Hence, the more persodic a melt is, the more aegirine will be crystallized and the more reduced this melt will be. This is because without a mineral donor for ferric iron, the crystal chemical forcing of the coupled crystallization of Na with Fe3+ drives oxidation of the dominant Fe2+ in the melt and thereby reduction of the C–H–S–O-bearing fluid and/or melt phase. This is in convincing agreement with observations from a variety of silica-undersaturated peralkaline complexes such as Ilimaussaq in Greenland, Mt. St. Hilaire in Canada, Lovozero and Khibina in Russia, and Tamazeght in Morocco, and explains the occurrence of magmatic methane in the most sodic of these complexes. In silica-oversaturated peralkaline melts such as comendites and pantellerites, however, this equilibrium appears to be less influential and these melts are accordingly less reduced. In perpotassic melts, in contrast, no K–Fe3+ pyroxene is stable and K can only be incorporated into dominantly Fe2+-bearing phases such as biotite or K-amphibole, if no K-feldspar is stable. Here, redox conditions in the coexisting fluid and/or melt are either unaffected or even driven to more oxidized values by the crystallization reactions, which is in accordance with observations on the ultrapotassic rocks of the Roman Province (Italy) or the kalsilite-bearing Murun complex in Siberia. We conclude that peralkalinity in magmatic rocks is tightly connected to oxygen fugacity, that both the generation and the evolution and crystallization of peralkaline melts are governed by redox equilibria, and that these depend strongly on the Na/K ratio as well as on the (Na + K)/Al ratio of the melt. The specific features of peralkaline rocks, such as the difference between agpaitic and miaskitic rocks, the unusual enrichment of high field strength elements and the occurrence of magmatic hydrocarbons in some of them, can all be explained by the oxygen fugacity-controlling model reactions discussed in this study.},

abstract = {We present new experimental apatite/melt trace element partition coefficients for a large number of trace elements (Cs, Rb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Lu, Y, Sr, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, U, Pb, and Th). The experiments were conducted at pressures of 1.0 GPa and temperatures of 1250 °C. The rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, and Lu), Y, and Sr are compatible in apatite, whereas the larger lithophile elements (Cs, Rb, and Ba) are strongly incompatible. Other trace elements such as U, Th, and Pb have partition coefficients close to unity. In all experiments we found DHf {\textgreater} DZr, DTa ≈ DNb, and DBa {\textgreater} DRb {\textgreater} DCs. The experiments reveal a strong influence of melt composition on REE partition coefficients. With increasing polymerisation of the melt, apatite/melt partition coefficients for the rare earth elements increase for about an order of magnitude. We also present some results in fluorine-rich and water-rich systems, respectively, but no significant influence of either H2O or F on the partitioning was found. Furthermore, we also present experimentally determined partition coefficients in close-to natural compositions which should be directly applicable to magmatic processes.},

abstract = {The Upper Rhine Graben has two Plio-Quaternary depocentres usually interpreted as resulting from tectonic reactivation. The southern basin, near Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), contains up to 250 m of sediments. Beneath the younger alluvial deposits related to the current drainage system, a former river network deeply entrenched in the substratum reveals a very low regional base level of early Pleistocene age. The offset of channels at faults allows us to infer a Pleistocene reactivation of the syn-rift fault pattern and the estimation of slip rates. Maximum vertical movements along the faults have not exceeded 0.1 mm/yr since the middle Pleistocene. Current activity is concentrated along the westernmost faults. Morphologic markers indicate late Pleistocene reactivation of the Rhine River fault, and geophysical prospecting suggests a near-surface offset of young sedimentary deposits. The size of the fault segments potentially reactivated suggests that earthquakes with magnitude larger than Mw = 6.3 could be expected in the area with a return interval of about 8000 years. Extrapolated to the duration of the Plio-Pleistocene, the strain rate estimates reveal that the tectonic forcing may account for only one-third to one-half of the whole thickness of the Plio-Pleistocene sediments of the basin fill. Thus other processes must be invoked to understand the growth of the Plio-Pleistocene basin. Especially the piracy of the Rhine River to the north during the early Pleistocene could explain these effects. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes our current understanding of the formation of porphyrystyle Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits, in the light of data obtained by direct analysis of the ore metals in individual fluid and melt inclusions using laser-ablation ICP mass spectrometry. An integrated study of the evolution of the calcalkaline Farall{\'{o}}n Negro Volcanic Complex hosting the Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry Cu-Au deposit (Argentina), and supplementary fluid-chemical data from Bingham (Utah) and other examples, permit a quantitative re-assessment of the fundamental processes controlling the key economic parameters of porphyry-style ore deposits. Deposit size (total metal content) is optimized by exsolution of a relatively dense ({\textgreater}0.3 g cm-3) single-phase fluid or a two-phase brine + vapour mixture from a moderately large hydrous pluton, possibly with an intermediate step involving the scavenging of the ore-forming elements in a magmatic sulphide melt. Emplacement mechanism, magma-chamber dynamics and possibly an additional source of sulphur are probably more decisive for the formation of a large deposit than sheer pluton volume and elevated Cu contents in the melts. Primary bulk ore grade is determined by temperature-controlled precipitation of ore minerals, which is optimized where a large magmatic fluid flux is cooled through 420-320 °C over a restricted vertical flow distance. Bulk metal ratios of the deposits, exemplified by the economically important Au/Cu ratio in the ore, are primarily controlled by the magmatic source defining the composition of the fluids before they reach the deposit site, although selective precipitation may contribute to metal zoning within orebodies. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2005.},

abstract = {Zircon and rutile are common accessory minerals whose essential structural constituents, Zr, Ti, and Si can replace one another to a limited extent. Here we present the combined results of high pressure–temperature experiments and analyses of natural zircons and rutile crystals that reveal systematic changes with temperature in the uptake of Ti in zircon and Zr in rutile. Detailed calibrations of the temperature dependencies are presented as two geothermometers—Ti content of zircon and Zr content of rutile—that may find wide application in crustal petrology. Synthetic zircons were crystallized in the presence of rutile at 1–2 GPa and 1,025–1,450°C from both silicate melts and hydrothermal solutions, and the resulting crystals were analyzed for Ti by electron microprobe (EMP). To augment and extend the experimental results, zircons hosted by five natural rocks of well-constrained but diverse origin (0.7–3 GPa; 580–1,070°C) were analyzed for Ti, in most cases by ion microprobe (IMP). The combined experimental and natural results define a log-linear dependence of equilibrium Ti content (expressed in ppm by weight) upon reciprocal temperature: log(Tizircon)=(6.01±0.03)−5080±30T(K).$\backslash$log ({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Ti{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}zircon{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}) = (6.01 $\backslash$pm 0.03) - $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}5080 $\backslash$pm 30{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}T$\backslash$;($\backslash$hbox{\{}K{\}}){\}}{\}}. In a strategy similar to that used for zircon, rutile crystals were grown in the presence of zircon and quartz (or hydrous silicic melt) at 1–1.4 GPa and 675–1,450°C and analyzed for Zr by EMP. The experimental results were complemented by EMP analyses of rutile grains from six natural rocks of diverse origin spanning 0.35–3 GPa and 470–1,070°C. The concentration of Zr (ppm by weight) in the synthetic and natural rutiles also varies in log-linear fashion with T −1: log(Zrrutile)=(7.36±0.10)−4470±120T(K).$\backslash$log ({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Zr{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}rutile{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}) = (7.36 $\backslash$pm 0.10) - $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}4470 $\backslash$pm 120{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}T$\backslash$;($\backslash$hbox{\{}K{\}}){\}}{\}}. The zircon and rutile calibrations are consistent with one another across both the synthetic and natural samples, and are relatively insensitive to changes in pressure, particularly in the case of Ti in zircon. Applied to natural zircons and rutiles of unknown provenance and/or growth conditions, the thermometers have the potential to return temperatures with an estimated uncertainty of ±10 ° or better in the case of zircon and ±20° or better in the case of rutile over most of the temperature range of interest (∼400–1,000°C). Estimates of relative temperature or changes in temperature (e.g., from zoning profiles in a single mineral grain) made with these thermometers are subject to analytical uncertainty only, which can be better than ±5° depending on Ti or Zr concentration (i.e., temperature), and also upon the analytical instrument (e.g., IMP or EMP) and operating conditions.},

abstract = {Equilibrium and dynamic crystallization experiments were used to determine distribution coefficients (D-values) for the REE and the trace elements Sc, V, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, Hf, Th, and U between Ti-Al-clinopyroxene and melt. Equilibrium values for D correlate well with previous studies where values have been determined. The D-values were also studied as a function of cooling rate. Increased cooling rates produce higher growth rates. At growth rates that exceed the diffusion rates in the crystals, the D-values increase to near unity and the HREE D-values exceed unity only at the most rapid crystal growth rates. The increase in D-values is the result of the inclusion of components into the growing pyroxene from the boundary layer that develops at the crystal-melt interface because of the disparity between the growth and diffusion rates. The origin of sector zoning is best explained as an interplay of primarily crystallographic control with kinetic effects.},

Spectra of Ti-bearing glasses show a significant difference between the Cl-free and the Cl-bearing composition. The Cl-free glass spectrum contains a strong, asymmetric peak at 900 cm−1 which is associated with Ti in fivefold coordination. This peak is shifted to higher frequency and becomes more symmetric with the addition of 0.3 wt{\%} Cl. Deconvolution of the high-frequency waveband indicates differences between spectra are the result of a contribution from a peak at 945 cm−1 resulting from Ti–O vibrations in fully polymerized titanate tetrahedra. It is proposed that addition of Cl destabilizes [5]Ti in favor of tetrahedral coordination as a result of competition between Cl and titanate groups for alkalis. The spectra of Zr-bearing glasses show a strong peak at 980 cm−1 which is not seen in spectra of the base glass, indicating a vibrational mode associated with a zirconosilicate structure. There is no discernible difference between the Raman spectra of Zr-bearing glasses with and without added Cl, indicating that the local structure around Zr is insensitive to the presence of Cl.},

abstract = {The redox sensitivity of Ce and Eu anomalies in zircon has been clearly demonstrated by experimental studies, and these may represent an important tool in the exploration for porphyry Cu deposits which are thought to be derived from oxidised magmas. These deposits are significant because they are the source of much of the world's copper and almost all of the molybdenum and rhenium, key elements in many modern technologies. However, Ce and Eu anomalies in zircon are also affected by the co-crystallisation of REE bearing phases, such as titanite. Here, we report the trace element chemistry of zircons from titanite-bearing intrusions associated with mineralisation at the world class Oyu Tolgoi porphyry Cu–Au deposit (Mongolia). Based on these data, we suggest that neither zircon Eu/Eu⁎, nor Ce4+/Ce3+ are robust proxies for melt redox conditions, because they are both too strongly dependent on melt REE concentrations, which are usually poorly constrained and controlled by the crystallisation of titanite and other REE-bearing phases. In spite of this, Eu/Eu⁎ can broadly distinguish between fertile and barren systems, so may still be an indicator of porphyry magma fertility, and a useful tool for exploration.},

LF events and very-long-period (VLP) events have been recorded at many volcanoes, and models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Deep long-period (LP) events are fairly common, but may represent several processes. Acoustic sensors have greatly improved the study of volcanic explosions. Volcanic tremor is stronger for fissure eruptions, phreatic eruptions, and higher gas contents. Path and site effects can be extreme at volcanoes. Seismicity at volcanoes is triggered by large earthquakes, although mechanisms are still uncertain. A number of volcanoes have significant deformation with very little seismicity. Tomography has benefited from improved techniques and better instrumental arrays.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal experiments in the temperature range 750–1020°C have defined the saturation behavior of zircon in crustal anatectic melts as a function of both temperature and composition. The results provide a model of zircon solubility given by: In DZrzircon/melt= −3.80−[0.85(M−1)]+12900/T where DZrzircon/melt is the concentration ratio of Zr in the stoichiometric zircon to that in the melt, T is the absolute temperature, and M is the cation ratio (Na + K + 2Ca)/(Al {\textperiodcentered} Si). This solubility model is based principally upon experiments at 860°, 930°, and 1020°C, but has also been confirmed at temperatures up to 1500°C for M = 1.3. The lowest temperature experiments (750° and 800°C) yielded relatively imprecise, low solubilities, but the measured values (with assigned errors) are nevertheless in agreement with the predictions of the model. For M = 1.3 (a normal peraluminous granite), these results predict zircon solubilities ranging from ∼ 100 ppm dissolved Zr at 750°C to 1330 ppm at 1020°C. Thus, in view of the substantial range of bulk Zr concentrations observed in crustal granitoids (∼ 50–350 ppm), it is clear that anatectic magmas can show contrasting behavior toward zircon in the source rock. Those melts containing insufficient Zr for saturation in zircon during melting can have achieved that condition only by consuming all zircon in the source. On the other hand, melts with higher Zr contents (appropriate to saturation in zircon) must be regarded as incapable of dissolving additional zircon, whether it be located in the residual rocks or as crystals entrained in the departing melt fraction. This latter possibility is particularly interesting, inasmuch as the inability of a melt to consume zircon means that critical geochemical “indicators” contained in the undissolved zircon (e.g. heavy rare earths, Hf, U, Th, and radiogenic Pb) can equilibrate with the contacting melt only by solid-state diffusion, which may be slow relative to the time scale of the melting event.},

abstract = {Phase equilibrium experiments were performed to determine the pre-eruptive conditions of the phonolitic magma responsible for the last eruption (about 1,150 yr B.P.) of Teide volcano. The Lavas Negras phonolite contains 30 to 40 wt{\%} of phenocrysts, mainly anorthoclase, diopside, and magnetite. We have investigated pressures from 100 to 250 MPa, temperatures from 750 to 925°C, water contents from 1.3 to 10 wt{\%}, at an oxygen fugacity (fO2) of 1 log unit above the Ni-NiO solid buffer. Comparison of the natural and experimental phase proportions and compositions indicates that the phonolite was stored at 900 ± 20°C, 150 ± 50 MPa, 3 ± 0.5 wt{\%} dissolved H2O in the melt. The fO2 was probably close to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz solid buffer judging from results of other experimental studies. These conditions constrain the magma storage depth at about 5 ± 1 km below current summit of Teide volcano. Given that the island has not suffered any major structural or topographic changes since the Lavas Negras eruption, any remaining magma from this event should still be stored at such depth and probably with a similar thermal and rheological state.},

abstract = {Based on the investigation of olivine phenocrysts and melt and spinel inclusions in them from the picrites of the Gudchikhinsky Formation and olivine phenocrysts and the whole-rock geochemistry from the Tuklonsky and Nadezhdinsky formations of the Noril'sk region, the compositions and conditions of formation and evolution of the parental melts and mantle sources of Siberian trap magmatism were evaluated. Olivine phenocrysts from the samples studied are enriched in Ni and depleted in Mn compared with olivines equilibrated with the products of peridotite melting, which suggests a considerable role of a nonperidotitic component (olivine-free pyroxenite) in their mantle source. The onset of Siberian trap magmatism (Gudchikhinsky Formation) was related to the melting of pyroxenite produced by the interaction of ancient recycled oceanic crust with mantle peridotite. During the subsequent evolution of the magmatic system (development of the Tuklonsky and Nadezhdinsky formations), the fraction of the pyroxenite component in the source region decreased rapidly (to 40 and 60{\%}, respectively) owing to the entrainment of peridotite material into the melting zone. The formation of magmas was significantly affected by the contamination by continental crustal material. The primitive magmas of the Gudchikhinsky Formation crystallized under near-surface conditions at temperatures of 1250–1170°C and oxygen fugacities 2.5–3.0 orders of magnitude below the Ni-NiO buffer. Simultaneously, the magmas were contaminated by continental silicic rocks and evaporites. The parental magmas of the Gudchikhinsky rocks corresponded to tholeiitic picrites with 11–14 wt {\%} MgO. They were strongly undersaturated in sulfur, contained less than 0.25 wt {\%} water and carbon dioxide, and were chemically similar to the Hawaiian tholeiites. They were produced by melting of a pyroxenite source at depths of 130–180 km in a mantle plume with a potential temperature of 1500–1580°C. The presence of low melting temperature pyroxenite material in the source of Siberian trap magmas promoted the formation of considerable volumes of melt under the thick continental lithosphere, which could trigger its catastrophic collapse. The contribution of pyroxenite-derived melt to the magmas of the Siberian trap province was no less than 40–50{\%}. This component, whose solid residue was free of sulfides and olivine, played a key role in the origin of high contents of Ni, Cu, and Pt-group elements and low sulfur contents in the parental trap magmas and prevented the early dispersion of these elements at the expense of sulfide melt fractionation. The high contents of Cl in the magmas resulted in considerable HCl emission into the atmosphere and could be responsible for the mass extinction at the Paleozoic-Mesozoic boundary.},

abstract = {Liquid-liquid partitioning of 42 elements between synthetic silicate melts and immiscible fluoride, chloride, carbonate, phosphate and sulfate liquids was studied at temperatures of 650-1100°C, pressures 72-100MPa, with 0-11wt.{\%} H 2O. One series of experiments was performed in a rotating internally-heated autoclave where separation of the immiscible liquids was assisted by centrifugal forces. An analogous series of experiments was done in static rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels. The experimentally determined liquid-liquid distribution coefficients (D's) vary over several orders of magnitude, as a result of variable Coulombic interactions between cations and anions. For alkaline, alkaline earth and rare earth elements ther is a strong and systematic dependence of the liquid/liquid D values on the ionic potential Z/r for all the examined systems. In contrast, highly charged cations (e.g., HFSE) show no systematic relationships between the D's and Z/r.New experimental constraints on the carbonate/silicate liquid-liquid D values presented here confirm that rare metals such as Nb, Zr, REE, Th and U concentrate in silicate liquids, and therefore carbonatites that carry economical rare metal mineralization are not likely to have formed by liquid immiscibility. The comparison between experimentally-determined carbonate-silicate liquid-liquid D values and bulk-rock natrocarbonatite vs. nephelinite compositions at the Oldoinyo Lengai in Tanzania reveals significant discrepancies for Cs, Rb, Ba, Be, Zn, heavy REE, Ti, Mo and W, thus rendering a simple, one-stage immiscibility model for Oldoinyo Lengai questionable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

At 10-20 GPa, near-solidus (ACP: 1,400-1,630 degrees C) carbonatitic melts with {\textless} 10 wt {\%} SiO2 and {\textgreater} 40 wt {\%} CO2 gradually change to carbonated silicate melts with {\textgreater} 25 wt {\%} SiO2 and {\textless} 25 wt {\%} CO2 between 1,480 and 1,670 degrees C in the presence of residual majorite garnet, olivine/wadsleyite, and clinoenstatite/clinopyroxene. With increasing degrees of melting, the melt composition changes to an alkali- and CO2-rich silicate melt (Mg{\#} = 83.7-91.6; similar to 26-36 wt {\%} MgO; similar to 24-43 wt {\%} SiO2; similar to 4-13 wt {\%} CaO; similar to 0.6-3.1 wt {\%} Na2O; and similar to 0.5-3.2 wt {\%} K2O; similar to 6.4-38.4 wt {\%} CO2). The temperature of the first appearance of CO2-rich silicate melt at 10-20 GPa is similar to 440-470 degrees C lower than the solidus of volatile-free peridotite. Garnet ? wadsleyite ? clinoenstatite + carbonatitic melt controls initial carbonated silicate melting at a pressure {\textless} 15 GPa, whereas garnet + wadsleyite/ ringwoodite + carbonatitic melt dominates at pressure {\textgreater} 15 GPa. Similar to hydrous peridotite, majorite garnet is a liquidus phase in carbonated peridotites (ACP and PERC) at 10-20 GPa. The liquidus is likely to be at similar to 2,050 degrees C or higher at pressures of the present study, which gives amelting interval of more than 670 degrees C in carbonated peridotite systems. Alkali-rich carbonated silicate melts may thus be produced through partial melting of carbonated peridotite to 20 GPa at near mantle adiabat or even at plume temperature. These alkali- and CO2-rich silicate melts can percolate upward and may react with volatile-rich materials accumulate at the top of transition zone near 410-km depth. If these refertilized domains migrate upward and convect out of the zone of metal saturation, CO2 and H2O flux melting can take place and kimberlite parental magmas can be generated. These mechanisms might be important for mantle dynamics and are potentially effective metasomatic processes in the deep mantle.},

abstract = {Rocks of two distinctly different magma series are found in a ∼4000-m-thick sequence of lavas and tuffs in the Maymecha River basin which is part of the Siberian flood-volcanic province. The tholeiites are typical low-Ti continental flood basalts with remarkably restricted, petrologically evolved compositions. They have basaltic MgO contents, moderate concentrations of incompatible trace elements, moderate fractionation of incompatible from compatible elements, distinct negative Ta(Nb) anomalies, and Nd values of 0 to +2. The primary magmas were derived from a relatively shallow mantle source, and evolved in large crustal magma chambers where they acquired their relatively uniform compositions and became contaminated with continental crust. An alkaline series, in contrast, contains a wide range of rock types, from meymechite and picrite to trachytes, with a wide range of compositions (MgO from 0.7 to 38 wt{\%}, SiO2 from 40 to 69 wt{\%}, Ce from 14 to 320 ppm), high concentrations of incompatible elements and extreme fractionation of incompatible from compatible elements (Al2O3/TiO2∼1; Sm/Yb up to 11). These rocks lack Ta(Nb) anomalies and have a broad range of Nd values, from −2 to +5. The parental magmas are believed to have formed by low-degree melting at extreme mantle depths ({\textgreater}200 km). They bypassed the large crustal magma chambers and ascended rapidly to the surface, a consequence, perhaps, of high volatile contents in the primary magmas. The tholeiitic series dominates the lower part of the sequence and the alkaline series the upper part; at the interface, the two types are interlayered. The succession thus provides evidence of a radical change in the site of mantle melting, and the simultaneous operation of two very different crustal plumbing systems, during the evolution of this flood-volcanic province.},

abstract = {The two world's largest complexes of highly alkaline nepheline syenites and related rare metal loparite and eudialyte deposits, the Khibina and Lovozero massifs, occur in the central part of the Kola Peninsula. We measured for the first time in situ the trace element concentrations and the Sr, Nd and Hf isotope ratios by LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer) in loparite, eudialyte an in some other pegmatitic minerals. The results are in aggreement with the whole rock Sr and Nd isotope which suggests the formation of these superlarge rare metal deposits in a magmatic closed system. The initial Hf, Sr, Nd isotope ratios are similar to the isotopic signatures of OIB indicating depleted mantle as a source. This leads to the suggestion that the origin of these gigantic alkaline intrusions is connected to a deep seated mantle source—possibly to a lower mantle plume. The required combination of a depleted mantle and high rare metal enrichment in the source can be explained by the input of incompatible elements by metasomatising melts/fluids into the zones of alkaline magma generation shortly before the partial melting event (to avoid ingrowth of radiogenic isotopes). The minerals belovite and pyrochlore from the pegmatites are abnormally high in 87Sr /86Sr ratios. This may be explained by closed system isotope evolution as a result of a significant increase in Rb/Sr during the evolution of the peralkaline magma.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates glaciovolcanism in the Mount Cayley volcanic field (MCVF) of southwestern British Columbia's Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB). The MCVF is dominated by intermediate magma compositions, has been intermittently glaciated, and has extreme topography. No study to date has focused on intermediate composition glaciovolcanic deposits in a similar setting. The core of this thesis is a 1:20,000 volcanological map, which was used in conjunction with field observations, geochemical data, and petrographic examinations to investigate the volcanological history of the MCVF, to investigate the eruptive processes that produce specific glaciovolcanic landforms, and to make predictions about paleo-ice thicknesses and distributions. The MCVF (and the entire GVB) has three dominant intermediate composition glaciovolcanic landform types: subglacial domes, flow-dominated tuyas, and impoundment features. Subglacial domes are irregularly-shaped piles of lava flows representing subglacial eruptions that commenced beneath 100-650 m of ice and did not breach the surface; in many cases, the subglacial domes grew to within 150 m of the ice surface. Flow-dominated tuyas are steep-sided, flat-topped stacks of lava flows representing subglacial eruptions that ultimately breached the ice surface. Subglacial domes and flow-dominated tuyas represent the same eruptive process, the primary difference being whether or not the ice was breached. Impoundment features are subaerial lava flows with steep flanks or termini representing channeling or ponding of lava by ice. All three landforms have intense fine-scale jointing that indicates cooling surfaces inconsistent with apparent paleotopography. Additionally, all lack features recording eruption into water (pillows and hyaloclastite), indicating efficient and continuous meltwater drainage during eruptions. This is different from glaciovolcanic deposits in most other settings. It also makes these deposits distinct from basaltic glaciovolcanic deposits in the GVB. A combination of ice geometry, topography, and magma composition is responsible; thin ice promotes the formation of drainage pathways around subglacial vents, while thin ice coupled with steep bedrock topography creates hydraulic gradients away from vents. Magma composition probably also plays a role, due to its effect on quantities of ice melted and the pressure in subglacial vent cavities and drainage conduits.},

abstract = {Trace element compositions of clinopyroxene and amphibole from three rift-related alkaline to peralkaline igneous complexes (syenites and granites) in South Greenland reflect evolving magma composition as well as crystal-chemical control on partitioning. Clinopyroxenes and amphiboles evolve from Ca–Mg-dominated members via intermediate to Na–Fe3+-dominated members. Most trace elements are highly enriched compared to primitive mantle values, consistent with the highly fractionated character of the host rocks. High field strength element (HFSE; Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Nb, Ta) abundances appear to be mainly controlled by the major element composition of the host crystal, which in turn determines the crystal site parameters. A crystal-chemical control is also indicated for the REE, since clinopyroxenes and amphiboles show continuous change from LREE-enriched patterns in the calcic minerals via wave-shaped pattern in the Ca–Na minerals towards a more pronounced HREE enrichment in the most Na-rich minerals. The low absolute abundances of large ion lithophile elements (Ba, Sr, Pb, Eu2+) are interpreted to reflect both a crystal-chemical aversion to incorporate these elements and the effects of prolonged feldspar fractionation on the melt composition. Eu and Pb abundances are also affected by oxygen fugacity and crustal assimilation, respectively. The partitioning of most trace elements between clinopyroxene and co-genetic amphibole is independent of melt composition or major element composition of the crystals. Most incompatible trace elements (particularly Nb, Ta, U, Th, Rb, Ba and Li) show a slight preference for amphibole. Exceptions to this general trend occur in rocks affected by late-stage fluid circulation resulting in the redistribution of some mobile elements. Calculation of trace-element compositions of coexisting melts using published partition coefficients for alkaline systems shows that melt compositions similar to whole-rock compositions are obtained for clinopyroxenes with broadly augitic to diopsidic compositions. There is a considerable mismatch between calculated melt and whole-rock data for various elements, i.e., Zr, Hf and the HREE, when melt compositions are calculated from NaFe3+-rich aegirine–augites and aegirines. Melt compositions from amphiboles also show only limited overlap with whole-rock data. The reasons for these differences may include the following: (1) The crystallization history of the rocks is very complex so that trace element partitioning cannot be expressed with a single partition coefficient. (2) Published mineral–melt partition coefficients cannot generally be applied due to compositional differences between the alkaline to peralkaline systems of this study and the previous studies. (3) Whole-rocks do not reflect melt compositions. Using a theoretical model of clinopyroxene–melt trace element partitioning based on the crystal chemistry alone, we show that absolute values of DREE decrease but the relative preference for HREE increases as the crystal becomes more aegirine-rich, which is in qualitative accordance with the observed REE patterns. Melts calculated from the theoretically determined partition coefficients show a good overlap with whole-rock data for relatively Fe3+-poor clinopyroxene compositions. Melts calculated from aegirines do not agree with whole-rock compositions, suggesting that the theoretical model needs refinements for the previously not considered incorporation of the NaFe3+Si2O6 component.},

abstract = {Investigations of a variety of continental rifts and margins worldwide have revealed that a considerable volume of melt can intrude into the crust during continental breakup, modifying its composition and thermal structure. However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning. Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin.},

It was erupted from the northeastern sector of the multicyclic Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera, the summit caldera complex of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Edifice. We present new stratigraphic data which allow the evolution of the eruption to be divided into six main stages: (1) an initial surge-producing phreatomagmatic phase. (2) Generation of a buoyant plinian column culminating in vent-wall collapse and temporary vent blockage. (3) A resumption of phreatomagmatic activity, producing accretionary lapilli-bearing ash surges and a phreatomagmatic ignimbrite. (4) Sustained column collapse, resulting in the progressive aggradation of a complex, compositionally layered ignimbrite sequence. (5) A late plinian phase marked by sharp chemical zonation. (6) Final vent destruction and the generation of multiple surges and pyroclastic flows. Volume calculations indicate a total erupted volume in the order of 13-14 km3 (3-4 km3 dense rock equivalent), which together with facies and lithic analysis implies that a small-scale caldera collapse, occured, contributing to the incremental enlargement of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera. The geochemistry and mingling inter-relationships of four magmatic endmembers, ranging from alkaline mafic to evolved phonolitic liquids, indicate that two magma chambers fed stages 4 and 5 of the eruption sequence. The eruption was triggered when mafic magma intruded the two-chamber system. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

These range from leucitite and picritic basalt to high-silica and peralkaline rhyolites. Data for pigeonite, aenigmatite, allanite and leucite are included, where these occur as additional phases. Coefficients have also been Rayleigh fractionation corrected, this correction being significant for those elements with high coefficients in specific mineral phases, and where pronounced crystallisation has occurred. Partition coefficients are presented as plots vs. NBO/T ratios of coexisting glasses (=melts). Negative correlations are observed, based on log-transformed data, for Mn, Zn, Fe and Y (pyroxenes), Mn, Zn and Fe (olivines), Mn and Zn (Fe-Ti-oxides), Nb, Y, Sr and Zr (hornblendes), Sr (plagioclase), and Ba, Cu, Zn and Fe (feldspars). These element partition coefficients are not correlated with bulk mineral compositions. Zr and Ga are not correlated with either glass or mineral compositions (except Zr in hornblende). The correlations support the role of melt polymerisation in controlling element partitioning, at least for those elements listed, although possible effects of temperature cannot be uniquely isolated in the present data set. The coefficients presented here are generally consistent with published values for equivalent rock compositions, one difference being that some of the higher published coefficients (e.g., Sr in plagioclase) are not matched in the present data set. From a practical viewpoint, the relative regularity of the coefficient data presented does facilitate choice of relevant coefficient values that are required for petrogenetic modelling procedures.},

abstract = {Rare earth element (REE) resources are commonly found associated with alkaline igneous complexes or carbonatites, or as secondary deposits derived from igneous rocks. Globally, many REE deposits occur around the margins of Archaean cratons, most in continental rift zones. Europe contains many such rift zones, which are generally younger in the south. Many of these rifts are intracontinental, whereas others are associated with the opening of oceans such as the Atlantic. All these rift systems have the potential to host REE resources, but whereas the older provinces of northern Europe are deeply exposed, exposures in southern Europe are largely at the supracrustal level. This paper considers how an understanding of the tectonic setting of Europe's REE resources is vital to guide future exploration.},

This enrichment in Ni is driven by the difference between the temperature of low-pressure crystallization and the temperature of melt extraction from the residue. The average observed enrichment of Ni in forsteritic olivine phenocrysts from Hawaii--relative to the typical olivines from mantle peridotites--is consistent with a simple scenario of high-temperature partial melting of an olivine-bearing source at the base of the lithosphere followed by low-temperature crystallization of olivine. The most extreme enrichments of Ni in Hawaiian olivine phenocrysts and the lower Ni contents of some olivines can also be explained by the known variability of Ni contents of olivines from mantle peridotites via the same simple scenario. Although we cannot rule out alternative hypotheses for producing the high-Ni olivines observed in Hawaii and elsewhere, these processes or materials are unnecessary to account for NiO enrichments in olivine. The absolute temperature, in addition to the difference between the temperature of melt segregation from the residue and the temperature of low-pressure crystallization, is a significant factor in determining the degree of Ni enrichment in olivine phenocrysts relative to the olivines in the mantle source. The moderate Ni enrichment observed in most komatiitic olivines compared with those of Hawaii may result from the higher absolute temperatures required to generate MgO-rich komatiitic melts. Observed NiO enrichments in early crystallizing komatiitic olivine are consistent with their high temperatures of crystallization and with a deep origin for the komatiite parental melts.},

The uncommon chemistry of the synthesized nontronites, notably the high level of Fe-for-Si substitution, induced particular XRD, FTIR, and differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetric analysis data. The ethylene glycol expandability of the synthetic nontronites was linked to their crystallinity and depended on the nature of the interlayer cation, moving from smectite to vermiculite-like behavior. As the synthesis temperature increased, the crystallinity of the synthesized clays increased. The nontronite obtained at 150°C had the ‘best crystallinity', which cannot be improved by increasing synthesis time or temperature.},

abstract = {Holistic mineral systems approaches are being increasingly adopted in the study of ore deposits but application in industry has been suboptimal, because of the lack of a conceptual framework to help translate the mineral system understanding to practical application. A four-step process is proposed for linking the conceptual mineral system with data available to support exploration targeting. These steps include translation from (1) critical processes of the mineral system, to (2) constituent processes of the mineral system, to (3) targeting elements reflected in geology, and (4) targeting criteria used to detect the targeting elements directly or by proxy. This translation process is illustrated using examples from komatiite-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE and orogenic Au mineral systems. Ranking of targets must be at the critical process level, rather than the current practice of mixing processes, elements and proxies.The significance of targeting elements and their mappable criteria changes as a function of the scale at which the critical processes operate and the availability of relevant geoscience datasets. This scale dependence is rarely recognised in current practice.Sources of uncertainty when translating the mineral system understanding into an effective exploration targeting system include: (1) resolution of a mappable criterion in a dataset, (2) how well the targeting criterion reflects the targeting element, (3) how well the targeting element reflects the critical process and (4) whether the process being mapped is critical for the genesis of a mineral deposit. The first three sources of uncertainty collectively are termed the representativeness of the targeting criteria (i.e., how representative is a mappable criterion of the constituent process for which it is a proxy). The last source of uncertainty reflects our lack of understanding of the processes that control mineralisation, and highlights areas for further research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Canary plume is one of the few plumes that can be traced to the core–mantle boundary, making it an excellent location for studying mantle melting dynamics. We performed a comprehensive study of the subaerial shield stage lavas erupted on Gran Canaria, Tenerife, La Gomera and La Palma because these rocks are believed to have been formed by the greatest degree of partial melting of the source and thus can provide direct insights into the origin of plume material and deep crustal recycling. The most primitive picritic to alkali basaltic and basanitic shield stage lavas are moderately enriched in light rare earth elements ([La/Sm]n = 2.1–4.6), strongly enriched in Nb and Ta ([Nb/La]n = 0.8–1.5, [Ta/La]n = 1.3–1.8) and depleted in K and Pb ([K/La]n = 0.2–0.7; [Pb/La]n = 0.2–0.3), resembling HIMU-type magmas. Fractional crystallization and phenocryst accumulation are processes affecting the compositions of parental magmas. The Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data (87Sr/86Sr = 0.702966–0.703312, 143Nd/144Nd = 0.512884–0.512929, 206Pb/204Pb = 19.49–20.27, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.59–15.66, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.21–39.81) and the relationship between Sr isotopes in whole rocks and O isotopes in olivine phenocrysts ($\delta$18O = 4.3–5.8 ± 0.3‰) argue against extensive magma contamination at crustal depths. Varying, but relatively low, degrees of partial melting (1–10{\%}) of a peridotite source containing 2–20{\%} garnet can explain the Zr/Y range between 6.7 and 10.3 but require unrealistically high amount of garnet (up to 30{\%}) to account for higher (up to 11.8) Zr/Y ratios in the lavas from Gran Canaria. This observation, as well as systematically lower CaO/Al2O3 ratios, higher SiO2 and NiO contents at a given MgO in the Gran Canaria lavas, as compared with those from other Canary Islands, imply melting of a plume probably containing garnet-bearing recycled component in a form of eclogite. The presence of amphibole and/or phlogopite is essential to produce variations in Ba/Nb (3.6–7.7), Ba/Th (51–108), K/La (65–295) and Nb/U (42–85) ratios in the shield stage magmas. We propose a scenario in which the magmas are derived through partial melting of a plume probably containing a recycled component with “ghost” amphibole and/or phlogopite signature; fluid-mobile elements compatible in amphibole and phlogopite could be preferentially lost to the subarc mantle during subduction-related breakdown of these phases. The relationships between He (3He/4He = 5.7–9.3 RA), Nd, Sr and Pb isotope ratios support the presence of a recycled component in the source of the Canary shield stage magmas. The observed relatively low 40Ar/36Ar isotopic ratios between ∼ 310 and ∼ 450 indicate contamination of plume-derived magmas by atmospheric air.},

These occur as pockets of granular dolomite (Mg{\#} 0.95-0.99) accompanied by fine-grained olivine and Al,Cr,Ti-rich clinopyroxene apparently produced by reaction of carbonate-rich fluids with the primary mineral assemblage of coarse spinel peridotites. Accessory apatite occurs in one sample. Most commonly, however, the Spitsbergen xenoliths contain patches and veins of quenched carbonate and silicate melts [1,2]. Our observations suggest that the mantle carbonates melted shortly before or during the transport of the xenoliths to the surface, which also triggered local melting in the peridotites to produce a Na,Al-rich silicate glass. Four carbonate-bearing peridotite xenoliths were acid leached and the leachates, the residues after leaching and the bulk rocks were analysed for 25 trace elements by ICP-MS. The trace element inventory of the leachates is dominated by dissolved carbonate material. The leachates, and the bulk peridotites, show marked enrichment in LREE, Sr, Ba and Rb and are relatively depleted in Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta. In-situ analyses by proton microprobe show very high contents of Sr in clinopyroxenes, primary carbonates and accessory apatite; the apatite is also very rich in LREE, U, Th and Br. Relative enrichment in LREE and Sr over HREE and HFSE appears to be characteristic of mantle carbonates and carbonate-bearing peridotites. High Sr Sm, Sm Hf, La Nb, Zr Hf and Nb Ta ratios in mantle peridotites (including basalt source regions) may be a signature of carbonate-related metasomatism. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Seamounts formed adjacent to mid-ocean ridges are the most abundant on Earth, numbering several orders of magnitude higher than hotspot-related seamounts. The Taney Seamounts are a linear NW–SE-trending, near mid-ocean ridge chain consisting of five volcanoes located on the Pacific plate 300 km west of San Francisco, California. Taney Seamount-A, the largest and oldest in the chain, has four well-defined calderas. These calderas have clear cross-cutting relationships, creating a relative chronology. The caldera walls and intracaldera pillow mounds were sampled systematically by a remotely operated vehicle to obtain stratigraphically controlled samples, a unique aspect of this study. Changes in lava geochemistry are consistent with an open-system sub-caldera reservoir that undergoes periodic collapse, replenishment, shallow crystallization, and eruption. Replenishing magmas contain large, anorthite-rich plagioclase crystals that exhibit sieve textures and zoning indicating interaction with percolating melt. The enrichment of elements in the lavas that are incorporated in plagioclase (e.g. aluminum, strontium) provides chemical evidence for the interaction between mantle-derived melts and plagioclase cumulates in the lower oceanic crust or upper mantle (8–12 km), prior to magmas entering the sub-caldera plumbing system. Based on trace element variations, the erupted lavas vary from typical peridotite-derived normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) compositions to those with an apparent residual garnet signature. Geochemical and thermodynamic modeling shows that decompression melting of a MORB mantle peridotite re-fertilized by garnet pyroxenite partial melts can reproduce the garnet signature observed in the Taney-A edifice lavas. Hence the magmatic architecture of Taney Seamount-A is characterized by the melting of a mixed lithology mantle, melt–rock interaction in the upper mantle to lower oceanic crust, and open-system evolution in a sub-caldera magma reservoir.},

abstract = {The Talbot Sub-basin is one of several bimodal volcanic depositional centres of the Mesoproterozoic Bentley Basin in central Australia. It is dominated by rocks of rhyolitic composition and includes ignimbrites, some forming large to super-eruption size deposits. Ferroan, incompatible trace element enriched, A-type compositions, anhydrous mineralogy and clear evidence for local rheomorphism indicate high eruption temperatures, with apparent zircon-saturation temperatures suggesting crystallization at {\textgreater}900°C. Comagmatic basalt is of mantle origin with minor Proterozoic basement contamination. The rhyolites cover the same range of Nd isotope compositions ($\epsilon$Nd(1070) +1{\textperiodcentered}24 to –0{\textperiodcentered}96) and La/Nb ratios (1{\textperiodcentered}2–2{\textperiodcentered}1) as the basalts ($\epsilon$Nd(1070) +2{\textperiodcentered}1 to –1{\textperiodcentered}1: La/Nb 1{\textperiodcentered}2–2{\textperiodcentered}3) and are compositionally far removed from all older basement and country-rock components (average $\epsilon$Nd(1070) = –4, La/Nb = 10). The rhyolites and basalts are cogenetic through a process probably involving both fractional crystallization of mafic magmas and partial melting of recently crystallized mafic rock in a lower crustal intraplate, extraction of dacitic magmas to a voluminous upper crustal chamber system, and separation of rhyolite by processes involving rejuvenation and cannibalization of earlier chamber material. More than 230 000 km3 of parental basalt is required to form the {\textgreater}22 000 km3 of preserved juvenile rhyolite in the Talbot Sub-basin alone, which represents one of the most voluminous known felsic juvenile additions to intracontinental crust. Zircon U–Pb age components are complex and distinct from those of basement and country rock and contain antecrystic components reflecting dissolution–regrowth processes during periodic rejuvenation of earlier-emplaced chamber material without any significant interaction with country rock. The overall duration of magmatism was {\textgreater}30 Myr but can be divided into between two and four separate intervals, each probably of a few hundred thousand years' duration and each probably reflecting one of the distinct lithostratigraphic groups defined in the sub-basin. Neither the composition nor style of felsic and mafic volcanism changes in any significant way from one volcanic event to the next and the range of zircon U–Pb ages indicates that each period utilized and cannibalized the same magma chamber. This volcanism forms a component of the 1090–1040 Ma Giles Event in central Australia, associated with magma-dominated extension at the nexus of the cratonic elements of Proterozoic Australia. This event cannot be reasonably reconciled with any putative plume activity but rather reflects the {\textgreater}200 Myr legacy of enhanced crustal geotherms that followed the final cratonic amalgamation of central Australia.},

abstract = {The K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t Complex (1275±1.8 Ma) in the Gardar Alkaline Province, South Greenland, cuts Archaean gneisses and comprises two intersecting syenitic stocks and a gabbroic ring-dyke. The magmas, with increasingly more primitive compositions, were emplaced successively by ring-faulting and roof stoping. The syenites are orthocumulates (cumulus alkali feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, titanomagnetite and apatite; intercumulus phases include alkali amphibole, biotite, quartz and calcite). In the well dissected earlier stock, a 2.2 km-thick layered sequence displays graded modal layering, feldspar lamination and cryptic layering. Modal layering in both stocks is directed mainly inwards at 35°–50°. Heterogeneous nucleation of the cumulus assemblage, close to steep thermal boundary layers, is inferred. The modal layering is ascribed primarily to gravitational sorting aided by the large density differential between a) feldspar and b) Fe-rich silicates and oxides. Episodic collapse of cumulus + melt slurries contributed to inward-dipping crystal pediments on the chamber floors. The Ring-Dyke (up to 100 m wide) is nearly continuous through 360°. K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t exhibits a compositional near-continuum from olivine gabbro through syenite intermediaries to alkali granite, ascribed to protracted assimilation/fractional crystallization processes. The most radiogenic Nd isotope data from K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t ($\epsilon$Ndi values between −3.3 and −1.0) point to a lithospheric mantle source, whereas the most unradiogenic values imply enrichment in LREE by crustal contamination of the magmas.},

abstract = {Accessory phases and minor components in minerals are commonly ignored in thermodynamic modelling. Such an approach seems unwarranted, as accessory phases can represent a significant element reservoir and minor components can substantially change their host mineral's stability field. However, a lack of thermodynamic data prohibits assessment of these effects. In this contribution, the polyhedron method is used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of tourmaline, a common and widespread accessory phase, stable over a range of P–T–X conditions. The polyhedron method allows $\Delta$H, S, V, CP and Vm(T,P) properties to be estimated from a linear stoichiometric summation over the fractional properties of its polyhedron constituents. To allow for estimates of tourmaline, fractional thermodynamic properties for BIII and BIV polyhedra were derived. Mixing contributions to molar volume were evaluated and symmetrical mixing parameters derived for Al-Mg, Al-Fe and Al-Li interaction on tourmaline's Y-site and T-site Al-Si interaction. Evaluation of the estimated properties using experimental and natural equilibria between tourmaline and melts, minerals and hydrothermal fluids, shows that reliable semi-quantitative results are obtained. The boron contents in fluids coexisting with tourmaline are calculated to within an order of magnitude of measured content, and where anchor-points are available, agreement improves to within a factor of 2. Including tourmaline in petrogenetic modelling of metamorphic rocks indicates that its presence leads to disappearance of staurolite and garnet, among others, and modifies the XMg of coexisting phases, in line with observations on natural rocks.},

abstract = {Eclogites are a comparatively rare but petrologically important member of kimberlite xenolith suites. Their broadly basaltic chemistry has led many authors to propose that they represent ancient, subducted ocean crust. Recent studies, however, have suggested an alternative origin and propose that kimberlitic eclogites are residues from the process of Archaean granitoid crust formation. Geochemical arguments in support of this new model were previously based on the trace-element chemistry of eclogitic minerals. Here I report that the major-element chemistry of eclogite xenoliths also supports a crustal residue model. I examine eclogite xenoliths from kimberlite pipes at Koidu, Sierra Leone, which sample the lithospheric mantle underlying the Archaean (2.8 Gyr) granitoid crust of the West African craton. Geochemical plots of major elements measured in unaltered, whole-rock samples of low-silica eclogite demonstrate that they are complementary to the granitoids of the West African craton and have compositions which indicate that both were derived from a common basaltic parent rock.},

The Scandian Event, and the formation of the Moine Thrust Zone, have previously been dated by a range of isotopic methods, and relatively imprecise ages on a suite of alkaline intrusions localized along the thrust zone have provided the best age constraints for deformation. Recent British Geological Survey mapping has improved our understanding of the structural relationships of some of these intrusions, and this work is combined with new U–Pb dates in this paper to provide significantly improved ages for the Moine Thrust Zone. Our work shows that a single early intrusion (the Glen Dessarry Pluton) was emplaced within the orogenic belt to the east of the Moine Thrust Zone at 447.9 ± 2.9 Ma. A more significant pulse of magmatism centred in the Assynt area, which temporally overlapped movement in the thrust zone, occurred at 430.7 ± 0.5 Ma. Movement in the thrust zone had largely ceased by the time of emplacement of the youngest intrusions, the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at 429.2 ± 0.5 Ma, and the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex.},

abstract = {Abstract —Based on the investigation of olivine phenocrysts and melt and spinel inclusions in them from the picrites of the Gudchikhinsky Formation and olivine phenocrysts and the whole-rock geochemistry from the Tuklonsky and Nadezhdinsky formations of the Noril'sk region, the compositions and conditions of formation and evolution of the parental melts and mantle sources of Siberian trap magmatism were evaluated. Olivine phenocrysts from the samples studied are enriched in Ni and depleted in Mn compared with olivines equilibrated with the products of peridotite melting, which suggests a considerable role of a nonperidotitic component (olivine- free pyroxenite) in their mantle source. The onset of Siberian trap magmatism (Gudchikhinsky Formation) was related to the melting of pyroxenite produced by the interaction of ancient recycled oceanic crust with mantle peridotite. During the subsequent evolution of the magmatic system (development of the Tuklonsky and Nadezhdinsky formations), the fraction of the pyroxenite component in the source region decreased rapidly (to 40 and 60{\%}, respectively) owing to the entrainment of peridotite material into the melting zone. The formation of magmas was significantly affected by the contamination by continental crustal material. The primitive magmas of the Gudchikhinsky Formation crystallized under near-surface conditions at temperatures of 1250– 1170 ° C and oxygen fugacities 2.5–3.0 orders of magnitude below the Ni–NiO buffer. Simultaneously, the magmas were contaminated by continental silicic rocks and evaporites. The parental magmas of the Gudchikhinsky rocks corresponded to tholeiitic picrites with 11–14 wt {\%} MgO. They were strongly undersaturated in sulfur, contained less than 0.25 wt {\%} water and carbon dioxide, and were chemically similar to the Hawaiian tholeiites. They were produced by melting of a pyroxenite source at depths of 130–180 km in a mantle plume with a potential temperature of 1500–1580 ° C. The presence of low melting temperature pyroxenite material in the source of Siberian trap magmas promoted the formation of considerable volumes of melt under the thick continental lithosphere, which could trigger its catastrophic collapse. The contribution of pyroxenite-derived melt to the magmas of the Siberian trap province was no less than 40–50{\%}. This component, whose solid residue was free of sulfides and olivine, played a key role in the origin of high contents of Ni, Cu, and Pt-group elements and low sulfur contents in the parental trap magmas and prevented the early dispersion of these elements at the expense of sulfide melt fractionation. The high contents of Cl in the magmas resulted in considerable HCl emission into the atmosphere and could be responsible for the mass extinction at the Paleozoic–Mesozoic boundary.},

abstract = {The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is among the largest igneous provinces on Earth, emplaced synchronously with or just prior to the Triassic–Jurassic (T–J) boundary ca. 200 Ma. In great part due to the controversial connection between the occurrence of CAMP and the events of the T–J boundary, the demand for better constraints on the duration and eruptive chronology of this province has increased. More than 100 new 40Ar/39Ar ages have been published in the last 15 years, with more than half of these in the last 3 years. A careful review and selection of available ages, as well as the publication of 16 new ages from the Carolinas, Newark Basin (USA), French Guyana and Morocco are presented. Judicious selection yields a total of 58 accepted age determinations for CAMP magmatism, ranging from 202 to 190 Ma covering every part of the CAMP. A more complete picture develops with intrusive CAMP magmatism commencing as early as 202 Ma. Extrusive activity initiated abruptly ∼ 200 Ma, reaching peak volume and intensity around 199 Ma on the African margin. The main period of CAMP magmatism is confirmed as brief, but is suggested to consist of at least two phases over ∼ 1.5 Ma, with magmatism commencing along the Africa–North American margins and slightly later along the South American margin. Two volumetrically minor, but distinctive magmatic peaks centered at 195 and 192 Ma are mirrored in data from all three continents and highlighted by our statistical approach. Models describing rifting and thermal input and magma production on these timescales are explored. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the chronology of CAMP, more data of better quality and broader geographical coverage are needed to completely characterize the evolution of the CAMP and infer its geodynamic origin. In addition, lack of a well-defined T–J boundary age, as well as the absence of a relevant basis for comparison between U/Pb and 40Ar/39Ar data for this time period remain limiting factors to unambiguously linking CAMP in time with the events of the T–J boundary.},

abstract = {The Kuboos-Bremen Igneous Province comprises a linear zone of alkaline complexes that intrude Proterozoic and Pan-African rocks and trends in a northeast direction from the northwest of the Cape Province in South Africa into southern Namibia. Of the three most southerly complexes in Namibia. two comprise silicate rocks ranging from nepheline syenite to alkali-granite and are called the Grootpenseiland and Marinkas Kwela Complexes (GPC and MKC). The Marinkas Kwela Carbonatite Complex is the third and most northerly of the complexes. Isotopic age determinations on a number of rock types from both the silicate complexes yield ages around 520Ma and are consistent with published Pan-African ages for the Province. Each silicate complex shows a migrating locus of intrusion from Si- undersaturated rocks in the southwest to Si-oversaturated rocks in the northeast. The complexes overlap in outcrop. The rocks are moderately to highly felsiC and none reflects primary magma compositions. The Si-undersaturated rocks from both complexes include side-wall cumulates formed from magmas that fractionated alkali-feldspar, clinopyroxene and amphibole. Foyaites also occur in the MKC and have a compositional range reflecting alkali-feldspar fractionation and, probably, some interaction with dolomite country rocks. Major and trace element data suggest that critically saturated alkali syenites occurring in both complexes evolved via protracted feldspar fractionation, and that critically saturated alkali-feldspar syenite occurring only in the GPC is a cumulate. The two rock types cannot be related genetically. Of the SI-oversaturated rocks in both complexes, those in the compositional range monzonite to granite were intruded before alkali-granites. Compositional diversity amongst the former reflects fractionation of feldspar and of mafic phases, but that process cannot genetically link the rocks to the alkali-granites. Isotopic compositions of Sr and Nd indicate that the silicate magmas were derived from an upper mantle source region characterised by low time-integrated Rb/Sr ratios and high time-Integrated Sm/Nd ratios, However, the evidence of Sr and 0 isotopic data is that the Si-oversaturated melts possibly interacted with a crustal component. presumably the Proterowlc rocks of the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. This interaction may explain the occurrence of apparently co-genetic rock series that evolved on opposite sides of the feldspar join in Petrogeny's Residua System. The Marinkas Kwela Carbonatite Complex was emplaced before the final intrusive phases of the MKC and exhibits unusually pronounced late-stage enrichment in manganese. The earliest intrusive rocks in the complex were nepheline syenites which were fenitised by later intrusions of sovites. Although the commonly occurring magmatic sequence of sovite-beforsite-ferrocarbonatite is observed at Marinkas Kwela. sovites do not appear to have been parental to beforsites. Removal of apatite and early crystallisation of magnetite distinguish magnetite-rich beforsite from co-genetic apatite-rich beforsite. Two further magmatic sequences. the first from apatite-rich beforsite through ferrocarbonatite to Mn-rich ferrocarbonatite (high Fe/Mn) and the second from magnetite-rich beforsite to Mn-rich ferrocarbonatite (low Fe/Mn). reflect fractionation of dolomite and of dolomite+magnetite respectively.},

abstract = {XRF analyses of 152 magmatic dyke samples from a broad area (150 × 60 km) of the Gardar Province in Southern Greenland span the time 1280 to 1163 Ma and represent a wide compositional range (transitional olivine basalts to trachytes, alkalinity index of 0.3 to 1.5). Among those, 16 dyke samples were additionally analysed for Cl and Br. Generally, the dykes represent a continuous fractionation trend from relatively unfractionated basalts to more highly fractionated trachytes. Dykes from different areas exhibit a diverse geochemistry suggesting a heterogeneous and metasomatised mantle source. Enrichment in LILE, LREE and Sr and depletion in HFSE, Nb and Ti suggest that some of the metasomatism may have been associated with subduction processes pre-dating Gardar activity by some 600 Ma (Ketilidian orogeny). The dykes are characterised by high F contents up to 1.2 wt.{\%}, particularly in the vicinity of the Ivigtut fluoride deposit. F was probably derived from partial melting of lithospheric mantle enriched in F-apatite and F-phlogopite. High Cl/Br ({\textgreater}500) and low Cl/F ({\textless}1) ratios of the dykes point to a fluid degassing/separation process which is supported by mineral/rock and fluid inclusion data from the Il{\'{i}}maussaq and Ivigtut intrusions. There, the analysed rocks and minerals generally show high Cl/Br ({\textgreater}300) and low Cl/F ({\textless}1) weight ratios whereas the fluid inclusions have complementary low ratios (Cl/Br ±100; Cl/F {\textgreater}10). Our investigations are in accordance with experimental data which show that F is preferentially enriched in the melt whereas Cl and especially Br are lost with the fluid phase. Accordingly, the halogens show an increase in incompatible behaviour in the magma in the order of F {\textless} Cl {\textless} Br. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experiments from 640 to 680 °C, 200 MPa H2O at␣f O2 ≈ NNO, employing a natural␣F-rich␣vitrophyric rhyolite from Spor Mountain, Utah, assessed the effect of variable Mg′ [100Mg/(Mg + Mn + Fe)] on the partitioning of fluorine and chlorine between biotite (Bt) and melt. Over this temperature interval, Bt ( ± fluorite, ± quartz) is the sole liquidus phase. Partition coefficients for fluorine between biotite and glass (DF Bt/melt) show a strong dependence on the Mg′ of Bt.␣DF Bt/melt varies from ˜ 1.5 to 7.2 over the range of Mg′ from 21 to 76. A strong linear correlation between␣DF Bt/melt␣and Mg′ has a slope of 9.4 and extrapolates through the origin (i.e., DF Bt/melt ≈ 0 at Mg′ = 0, an annite-siderophyllite solid solution in these experiments). DCl Bt/melt values ( ˜ 1 to 6) in the same experiments vary inversely with Mg′. The Al-content of biotite does not vary with the aluminum saturation index (ASI = molar Al2O3/$\Sigma$ alkali and alkaline earth oxides) of melt, but two exchange mechanisms involving Al appear to operate in these micas: (1) Alvi + Aliv ? Siiv + Mgiv, and Mgiv + 2Aliv? 2Siiv + □iv. The effects of other components such as Li or other intensive parameters including f O2 have yet to be evaluated␣systematically. At comparable Mg′ of Bt, however, the Spor Mountain rhyolite yields higher DF Bt/melt values than an Li-rich, strongly peraluminous melt previously investigated. The results indicate that the Mg′ of Bt exerts the principal control on halogen partitioning, with ASI and T as second-order variables. The experimental partition coefficients compare well with other experimental results but not with most volcanic rocks. Magmatic Bt from most rhyolites records higher DF Bt/melt due to reequilibration with degassed (H2O-depleted) magma and perhaps with F2O−1 exchange that may accompany oxidation ([Fe3+O] [Fe2+OH]−1). This behavior is evident in magmatic biotite from a zoned peraluminous rhyolite complex near Morococala, Bolivia: Bt is sharply zoned with F-rich rims, but Bt(core)-melt inclusion pairs fall on our experimental curve for DF Bt/melt. These experimental data can be used in part to assess the preservation of magmatic volatile contents in plutonic or volcanic silicic rocks. For plutonic rocks, the actual F-content of melt, not a relative activity ratio involving HF species, can be reasonably estimated if the mica has not undergone subsolidus reequilibration. This information is potentially useful for some shallow-level Ca-poor magmas that are thought to be rich in F (e.g., A- and S-type granites) but do not conserve F well as rocks.},

abstract = {An experimental study of the effect of boron in the water saturated Q-Or-Ab-B2O3-H2O system has been performed at P=1 Kbar to provide experimental data and explain the role of boron in some late magmatic and early hydrothermal events. Experiments were conducted between 500° C and 800° starting from a gel, or a previously crystallized gel, and variable amounts of boron (0 to 18{\%} B2O3) added to water. The phases obtained were: quartz, sanidine, albite, silicate liquid quenched to glass, and aqueous vapour phase. Boric acids, borates and isotropic low index materials were found in the quenched vapour phase. An aluminium silicate-like mineral, not yet fully identified, is also present. The solidus temperature of the Q-Or-Ab composition is lowered by 60° C when 5 wt. {\%} B2O3 is added and by more than 130° C when 17wt. {\%} B2O3 is added. Compositions of equilibrated silicate melts and vapours were obtained between 780° C and 750° C for various B2O3 concentrations. The vapour phase is B and Si rich. It is also enriched in Na with respect to K, and in alkalis with respect to Al. Its silicate solute content is higher than in experiments with pure water. The solubility of water is increased by the addition of boron in Q-Or-Ab melts. Microprobe data show that the melts equilibrated with vapour phases become hyperaluminous and more potassic than sodic. The partition coefficient of boron is in favour of the vapour (k D=B2O3{\%} in melt/B2O3{\%} in vapour=0.33±0.02). The effect of the interaction between the silicate phases and the vapour is discussed. Comparison is made between the behaviour of boron and that of chlorine and fluorine. Geological applications are also provided, which concern the influence of boron on minimum melting, on muscovite stability and on the hypersolvus-subsolvus transition.},

abstract = {The Canary plume is one of the few plumes that can be traced to the core-mantle boundary, making it an excellent location for studying mantle melting dynamics. We performed a comprehensive study of the subaerial shield stage lavas erupted on Gran Canaria, Tenerife, La Gomera and La Palma because these rocks are believed to have been formed by the greatest degree of partial melting of the source and thus can provide direct insights into the origin of plume material and deep crustal recycling. The most primitive picritic to alkali basaltic and basanitic shield stage lavas are moderately enriched in light rare earth elements ([La/Sm]n = 2.1-4.6), strongly enriched in Nb and Ta ([Nb/La]n = 0.8-1.5, [Ta/La]n = 1.3-1.8) and depleted in K and Pb ([K/La]n = 0.2-0.7; [Pb/La]n = 0.2-0.3), resembling HIMU-type magmas. Fractional crystallization and phenocryst accumulation are processes affecting the compositions of parental magmas. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data (87Sr/86Sr = 0.702966-0.703312, 143Nd/144Nd = 0.512884-0.512929, 206Pb/204Pb = 19.49-20.27, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.59-15.66, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.21-39.81) and the relationship between Sr isotopes in whole rocks and O isotopes in olivine phenocrysts (??18O = 4.3-5.8 ?? 0.3???) argue against extensive magma contamination at crustal depths. Varying, but relatively low, degrees of partial melting (1-10{\%}) of a peridotite source containing 2-20{\%} garnet can explain the Zr/Y range between 6.7 and 10.3 but require unrealistically high amount of garnet (up to 30{\%}) to account for higher (up to 11.8) Zr/Y ratios in the lavas from Gran Canaria. This observation, as well as systematically lower CaO/Al2O3 ratios, higher SiO2 and NiO contents at a given MgO in the Gran Canaria lavas, as compared with those from other Canary Islands, imply melting of a plume probably containing garnet-bearing recycled component in a form of eclogite. The presence of amphibole and/or phlogopite is essential to produce variations in Ba/Nb (3.6-7.7), Ba/Th (51-108), K/La (65-295) and Nb/U (42-85) ratios in the shield stage magmas. We propose a scenario in which the magmas are derived through partial melting of a plume probably containing a recycled component with "ghost" amphibole and/or phlogopite signature; fluid-mobile elements compatible in amphibole and phlogopite could be preferentially lost to the subarc mantle during subduction-related breakdown of these phases. The relationships between He (3He/4He = 5.7-9.3 RA), Nd, Sr and Pb isotope ratios support the presence of a recycled component in the source of the Canary shield stage magmas. The observed relatively low 40Ar/36Ar isotopic ratios between ??? 310 and ??? 450 indicate contamination of plume-derived magmas by atmospheric air. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Collapse calderas can be attributed to subsidence of the magma chamber roof along bounding sub-vertical normal faults (ring-faults) after a decompression of the magma chamber. It has previously been shown that for ring-faults to initiate, and thus facilitate collapse, the stress field both at the surface and around the magma chamber must satisfy specific critical conditions. Here, we present new numerical models that use a Finite Element Method to investigate the effects of crustal layering on local stress field distribution. Results are compared with existing criteria for ring-fault initiation. Different subsurface scenarios were simulated by varying the stiffness (Young's modulus) of layers placed above the magma chamber, and the host rock in which the chamber is seated. We consider depressurisation of a magma chamber, so as to simulate magma withdrawal. Results indicate that mechanical layering is a further first-order variable in the rare achievement of stress conditions required for ring-fault formation, and may be influential in facilitating or inhibiting caldera collapse. We show that for a given geometrical set-up, the magnitude and position of maximum tensional stress at the Earth's surface are influenced by the occurrence and relative distribution of mechanically stiff or soft lithologies above the magma chamber. For example, tensional stress at surface may be reduced by the presence of stiff layers (e.g. lavas), or increased by soft layers (e.g. pyroclastic units) compared to generic simulations using a homogeneous background medium. Overall we find that the presence of mechanically soft material promotes surface fracture initiation. In addition we suggest that the position of peak tensional stress at surface derived by the numerical models does not represent that related to the position of the bounding ring-fault, but is instead related to the position of initial tensional fractures appearing prior to the collapse faults.},

Remarkably coherent systematics are present among major and trace element concentrations and ratios, with the exception of three arcs influenced by mantle plumes and Peru/N. Chile, which is built on exceptionally thick crust. Chemical parameters also correlate with the thickness of the overlying arc crust. In addition to previously established correlations of Na6.0 with Ca6.0 and crustal thickness, correlations are observed among major elements, trace elements, and trace element ratios (e.g. La/Yb, Dy/Yb, Zr/Sm, Zr/Ti). Positive correlations include “fluid mobile,” “high field strength,” and “large ion lithophile” element groups, with concentrations that vary by a factor of five in all groups. Incompatible element enrichments also correlate well with crustal thickness, with the greatest enrichment found at arcs with the thickest crust. Intra-crustal processes, however, do not reproduce the global variations. High pressure fractionation produces intermediate magmas enriched in aluminum, but such magmas are rare. Furthermore, differences among magma compositions at various volcanic arcs persist from primitive to evolved compositions, which is inconsistent with the possibility that global variations are produced by crystal fractionation at any pressure. Linear relationships among elements appear to be consistent with mixing between depleted primary magma and an enriched contaminant, but the required composition of the theoretical enriched end-member is not similar to compositions expected in the deep crust or to any known rock composition. The large-scale chemical variations among volcanic arcs are therefore likely to be generated by processes in the subducting slab or mantle wedge, rather than the crust. While crustal processes are important in the differentiation of convergent margin magmas, they do not account for the systematics presented here. Models that attribute the chemical variability of arc magmas to slab or wedge processes are also constrained to be consistent with the global chemical systematics, and are discussed in Turner and Langmuir (2015).},

abstract = {Elemental and isotopic (Sr, Nd and Pb) analyses of silicate and carbonatite rocks from Brava, the southernmost island of the Cape Verde archipelago, are reported here to assess the nature, origin and location of the main contributors to magma composition and to evaluate the chemical evolution of magma through time. In contrast to other islands of the archipelago where a continuous range is usually observed, Brava is clearly characterized by two groups of distinct isotopic compositions. Rocks from the Upper Unit ({\textless}. 0.5. Ma) are less Nd- and Pb-radiogenic and more Sr-radiogenic than rocks belonging to the Basal Complex ({\~{}}. 3 to 1.4. Ma), which are also characterized by more unradiogenic He signatures. Here, the chemistry of the Basal Complex is mainly explained by the mixing of a high-$\mu$ (HIMU)-type local end-member, which represents an ancient ({\~{}}. 1.3. Ga) recycled oceanic crust, with the lower mantle. For the Upper Unit, elemental and isotopic signatures suggest the involvement of an additional local end-member akin to the EM1-type. Such differences in the contributing end-members to the Upper Unit and Basal Complex sources mirror those usually assigned to the southern and northern Cape Verde islands, respectively. This temporal evolution is discussed in light of plume interaction with a shallow EM1-type domain, which is considered to represent the subcontinental lithosphere floating in the asthenosphere. Brava carbonatites define two distinct groups with similar isotopic ranges as those observed for the coeval alkaline silicate rocks. This observation suggests that, in each of the volcano-stratigraphic units, carbonatite and silicate magmas are ultimately derived from the same sources. We propose that calciocarbonatites from either the Basal Complex or the Upper Unit resulted from nephelinite-carbonatite liquid immiscibility, while the subordinate Basal Complex magnesiocarbonatites represent residual liquids after calcite fractionation from carbonatite magma. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sulfur partitioning between melt and fluid phase largely controls the environmental impact of volcanic eruptions. Fluid/melt partitioning data also provide the physical basis for interpreting changes in volcanic gas compositions that are used in eruption forecasts. In order to better constrain some variables that control the behavior of sulfur in felsic systems, in particular the interaction between different volatiles, we studied the partitioning of sulfur between aqueous fluids and haplogranitic melts at 200 MPa and 750 – 85C as a function of oxygen fugacity (Ni-NiO or Re-ReO2 buffer), melt composition (Al/(Na+K) ratio), and fluid composition (NaCl and CO2 content). The data confirm a first-order influence of oxygen fugacity on the partitioning of sulfur. Under " reducing conditions " (Ni-NiO buffer), D fluid/melt is nearly one order of magnitude larger (323 ± 14 for a metaluminous melt) than under " oxidizing conditions " (Re-ReO2 buffer; 74 ± 5 for a metaluminous melt). This effect is likely related to a major change in sulfur speciation in both melt and fluid. Raman spectra of the quenched fluids show the presence of H2S and HS -under reducing conditions and of SO4 2-and HSO4 -under oxidizing conditions, while SO2 is undetectable. The latter observation suggests that already at the Re-ReO2 buffer, sulfur in the fluid is almost completely in the S 6+ state and therefore more oxidized than expected according to current models. CO2 in the fluid (up to xCO2 = 0.3) has no effect on the fluid/melt partitioning of sulfur, neither under oxidizing nor under reducing conditions. However, the effect of NaCl depends on redox state. While at oxidizing conditions, D fluid/melt is independent of xNaCl, the fluid/melt partition coefficient strongly decreases with NaCl content under reducing conditions, probably due to a change from H2S to NaSH as dominant sulfur species in the fluid. A decrease of D fluid/melt with alkali content in the melt is observed over the entire compositional range under reducing conditions, while it is prominent only between the peraluminous and metaluminous composition in oxidizing experiments. Overall, the experimental results suggest that for typical oxidized subduction zone magmas, the degassing of sulfur is not influenced by the presence of other volatiles, while under reducing conditions, strong interactions with chlorine are observed. If the sulfur oxidation state is preserved during an explosive eruption, a large fraction of the sulfur released from oxidized magmas may be in the S 6+ state and may remain undetected by conventional methods that only measure SO2. Accordingly, the sulfur yield and the possible climatic impact of some eruptions may be severely underestimated.},

The mica-melt partition coefficients of Cl and F also behave differently. The Cl partition coefficient gradually increases from 0.17 to 0.33 with increasing Cl content in the system, whereas the partition coefficient of F sharply decreases from 3.0 to 1.0 with increasing total F content. The apparent partition coefficients of F between biotite and groundmass (melt) in various magmatic rocks are usually significantly higher than the experimental values.

abstract = {Cooling rate and fO2 are each varied over several orders of magnitude in a matrix of 1-atm constant-rate cooling experiments using synthetic basalt. The modes and compositions of olivine, pyroxene and titanomagnetite are sensitive to oxygen fugacity (ranging from QFM - 4 to QFM + 5??log units), whereas their textures respond to the degree of undercooling as modulated by cooling rate (ranging from 2.8 to 231????C h- 1). Key results pertain to the trends in mineral composition, melt differentiation, and crystal texture development: (1) The degree of pyroxene compositional zoning in a given experiment increases with decreasing cooling rate. For a given cooling rate, the Ti/Al ratio and MgO crystal-melt partitioning coefficients for pyroxene are inversely correlated with fO2, and the Mg contents of Ca-rich pyroxene and titanomagnetite increase with increasing fO2. Both trends are inferred to result from the fO2 control over melt Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio. (2) Reducing conditions lead to greater crystal contents than do oxidizing conditions, yet for any given cooling rate the compositions of matrix glasses are progressively more evolved as fO2 increases. The liquid lines of descent followed by residual melts are tholeiitic at reducing conditions and calc-alkaline at oxidizing conditions. The greater viscosities of residual liquids evolving toward silica enrichment at high fO2 may be responsible for declining solidification efficiency with increasing fO2. (3) Up to three distinct crystal populations of titanomagnetite, olivine, and pyroxene crystals, identified in each charge using qualitative morphologic criteria, are quantified in terms of volume fraction and the surface area per unit volume, Sv
P [mm- 1]. The presence of distinct populations suggests that nucleation of given mineral phases occurs episodically. The balance between thermodynamic driving force and kinetic inhibiting factors is optimized for the greatest number of pyroxene nucleation events at intermediate cooling rates. Anhedral crystals possess large surface area to volume (Sv
P) ratios, and these ratios are relatively insensitive to cooling rate. In contrast, the Sv
P ratios of euhedral crystal populations, as well as the weighted population averages, steadily decline with decreasing cooling rate. These trends are consistent with the energetics of 2D and 3D nucleation processes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The viscosity of pantelleritic melts from the Khaggiar lava flow (5.5 ka — Pantelleria Island) was investigated as a function of temperature and water content. High (1673–1323 K) and low (973–613 K) temperature dry and hydrous liquid viscosities were determined by a combination of concentric cylinder (102.44 to 104.56 Pa s) and micropenetration (108.67 to 1011.37) viscometric techniques. The effect of water, from 0.02 to 3.55 wt.{\%} H2O, was explored in the temperature range of 973–613 K. Liquid viscosities have been parameterized by means of a modified Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann equation (VFT) which describes viscosities and derivative properties (glass transition temperature Tg, fragility m) of silicic liquids as a function of T–X (H2O). The results yield the expected strong decrease of viscosity with temperature and water content. Fragility, as a measure of the deviation from Arrhenian behavior, increases with H2O content from m = 23 to m = 28. The peralkalinity (molar alkali excess over alumina), which characterizes the pantelleritic magmas, exerts a primary control over the rheological behavior of these melts. The excess of alkalies over alumina content is responsible for the peculiarly low viscosities of pantelleritic liquids compared to their metaluminous counterpart in the high temperature range, and leads to an even more dramatic decrease in the viscosities of these rhyolites in the low temperature range. Comparison with available models shows substantial differences between the measured and calculated viscosities. Based on our new viscosity results combined with existing literature data, we propose a new parameterization based on a modified Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann equation, accounting for the effect of water and composition, which can be used to determine the viscosity of pantelleritic melts. The derived relationship reproduces the experimental data (58 in total) in the viscosity range from 102.44 to 1011.37 Pa s and in the temperature range from 613 to 1673 K within a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.12 log units. Application of this calculation model for high temperature low viscosity hydrous melt is limited by the lack of experimental data and needs verification by additional measurements. Volcanological implications for welding and rheomorphic processes as well as conduit dynamic modeling are also discussed in light of the results presented in this work.},

abstract = {The isotopic diversity of oceanic island basalts (OIB) is usually attributed to the influence, in their sources, of ancient material recycled into the mantle, although the nature, age, and quantities of this material remain controversial. The unradiogenic Pb isotope signature of the enriched mantle I (EM I) source of basalts from, for example, Pitcairn or Walvis Ridge has been variously attributed to recycled pelagic sediments, lower continental crust, or recycled subcontinental lithosphere. Our study helps resolve this debate by showing that Pitcairn lavas contain sulfides whose sulfur isotopic compositions are affected by mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF down to $\Delta$33S = −0.8), something which is thought to have occurred on Earth only before 2.45 Ga, constraining the youngest possible age of the EM I source component. With this independent age constraint and a Monte Carlo refinement modeling of lead isotopes, we place the likely Pitcairn source age at 2.5 Ga to 2.6 Ga. The Pb, Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic mixing arrays show that the Archean EM I material was poor in trace elements, resembling Archean sediment. After subduction, this Archean sediment apparently remained stored in the deep Earth for billions of years before returning to the surface as Pitcairn´s characteristic EM I signature. The presence of negative S-MIF in the deep mantle may also help resolve the problem of an apparent deficit of negative $\Delta$33S anomalies so far found in surface reservoirs. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Amphibole has been discussed to potentially represent an important phase during early chemical evolution of arc magmas, but is not commonly observed in eruptive arc rocks. Here, we present an in-depth study of metastable calcic amphibole megacrysts in basaltic andesites of Merapi volcano, Indonesia. Radiogenic Sr and Nd isotope compositions of the amphibole megacrysts overlap with the host rock range, indicating that they represent antecrysts to the host magmas rather than xenocrysts. Amphibole-based barometry suggests that the megacrysts crystallised at pressures of {\textgreater}500 MPa, i.e., in the mid- to lower crust beneath Merapi. Rare-earth element concentrations, in turn, require the absence of magmatic garnet in the Merapi feeding system and, therefore, place an uppermost limit for the pressure of amphibole crystallisation at ca. 800 MPa. The host magmas of the megacrysts seem to have fractionated significant amounts of amphibole and/or clinopyroxene, because of their low Dy/Yb ratios relative to the estimated compositions of the parent magmas to the megacrysts. The megacrysts' parent magmas at depth may thus have evolved by amphibole fractionation, in line with apparently coupled variations of trace element ratios in the megacrysts, such as e.g., decreasing Zr/Hf with Dy/Yb. Moreover, the Th/U ratios of the amphibole megacrysts decrease with increasing Dy/Yb and are lower than Th/U ratios in the basaltic andesite host rocks. Uranium in the megacrysts' parent magmas, therefore, may have occurred predominantly in the tetravalent state, suggesting that magmatic fO2 in the Merapi plumbing system increased from below the FMQ buffer in the mid-to-lower crust to 0.6–2.2 log units above it in the near surface environment. In addition, some of the amphibole megacrysts experienced dehydrogenation (H2 loss) and/or dehydration (H2O loss), as recorded by their variable H2O contents and D/H and Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and the release of these volatile species into the shallow plumbing system may facilitate Merapi's often erratic eruptive behaviour.},

abstract = {The Siberian Traps flood basalts transferred a large mass of volatiles from the Earth's mantle and crust to the atmosphere. The eruption of the large igneous province temporally overlapped with the end-Permian mass extinction. Constraints on the sources of Siberian Traps volatiles are critical for determining the overall volatile budget, the role of crustal assimilation, the genesis of Noril'sk ore deposits, and the environmental effects of magmatism. We measure sulfur isotopic ratios ranging from −10.8‰ to +25.3‰ Vienna Ca{\~{n}}on Diablo Troilite (V-CDT) in melt inclusions from Siberian Traps basaltic rocks. Our measurements, which offer a snapshot of sulfur cycling far from mid-ocean ridge and arc settings, suggest the $\delta$34S of the Siberian Traps mantle melt source was close to that of mid-ocean ridge basalts. In conjunction with previously published whole rock measurements from Noril'sk, our sulfur isotopic data indicate that crustal contamination was widespread and heterogeneous—though not universal—during the emplacement of the Siberian Traps. Incorporation of crustal materials likely increased the total volatile budget of the large igneous province, thereby contributing to Permian–Triassic environmental deterioration.},

abstract = {High-pressure (HP) metamorphic blocks enclosed in a mafic to ultramafic matrix from a m{\'{e}}lange on the island of Syros are rimmed by tourmaline-bearing reaction zones (blackwalls). The B isotopic composition of dravitic tourmaline within these blackwalls was investigated in situ by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Boron in these tourmalines is unusually heavy, with $\delta$11B values exceeding +18‰ in all investigated samples and reaching an extreme value of +28{\textperiodcentered}4‰ in one sample. Blackwalls formed during exhumation of the HP m{\'{e}}lange at a depth of 20–25 km at temperatures of 400–430°C, by influx of external hydrous fluids. The compositions of the fluids are estimated to be in the range of 100–300 $\mu$g/g B with $\delta$11B values of +18 to +28‰. The high $\delta$11B values cannot be explained by tourmaline formation from unmodified slab-derived fluids. However, such fluids could interact with the material in the exhumation channel on their way from the dehydrating slab to the site of tourmaline formation in the blackwalls. This could produce exceptionally high $\delta$11B values in the fluids, a case that is modelled in this study. The model demonstrates that subduction fluids may be effectively modified in both trace element and isotopic composition during their migration through the material overlying the subducting slab. Blackwall tourmaline from Syros has a large grain size (several centimetres), high abundance, and an exceptionally high $\delta$11B value. The formation of tourmaline at the contact between mafic or felsic HP blocks and their ultramafic matrix involved fluids released during dehydration reactions in the subducting slab. It forms a heavy-boron reservoir in hybrid rocks overlying the subducting slab, and may, thus, have a significant impact on the geochemical cycle of B and its isotopes in subduction zones.},

abstract = {The Teide and Pico Viejo stratocones and the Northwest and Northeast Rifts are products of the latest eruptive phase of the island of Tenerife, initiated with the lateral collapse of its northern flank that formed the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera and the Icod–La Guancha Valley ca. 200 ka. The eruptive and structural evolution of this volcanic complex has been reconstructed after detailed geological mapping and radioisotopic dating of the significant eruptive events. A set of 54 new 14C and K/Ar ages provides precise age control of the recent eruptive history of Tenerife, particularly Teide Volcano, the third-highest volcanic feature on Earth (3718 m above sea level, {\textgreater}7 km high), and unique in terms of its intraplate setting. The development of the Teide–Pico Viejo Volcanoes may be related to the activity of the Northwest and Northeast Rifts. Volcanic and intrusive activity along both rift zones may have played an important role in activating the gravitational landslide and in the subsequent growth, nested within the collapse embayment, of an increasingly higher central volcano with progressively differentiated magmas. The coeval growth of the central volcano with sustained activity along the rifts led to a clear bimodal distribution in composition of eruptive products, with the basaltic eruptions in the distal part of the rifts and phonolitic and more explosive eruptions in the central area, where the differentiated stratocones developed. Current volcanic hazard in Tenerife is considered to be moderate, because eruptive frequency is low, explosivity is modest, and the eruptive activity of the Teide stratocone seems to have declined over the past 30 k.y., with only one eruption in this period (1150 yr B.P.).},

Despite its importance there remains uncertainty as to its origin and the source of the magmas that formed it. The lower Bushveld series, made up of the Basal Ultramafic Sequence (BUS), the Marginal Zone and Lower Zone, is of particular importance because it allows detailed in-sight into the reservoirs that multiply contributed to the formation and modification of the initial magmas. This sequence is represented by three overlapping drill cores (2100 m of stratigraphy) in the eastern Bushveld Complex for which we present the first comprehensive study on intercumu-lus mineral assemblages, incompatible trace elements and in situ Sr isotopes in plagioclase from over 130 core samples for this section (Clapham area).

At 845–865 °C, the maximum Cl concentration in the melt (mCl) coexisting with Cl-rich ({\~{}} 35.5 wt.{\%}; flCl) and F-free fluid is about 0.5 wt.{\%}. An addition of F to the system increases the Cl content of the melt up to 0.7 wt.{\%} at {\~{}} 39 wt.{\%} Cl and {\~{}} 13 wt.{\%} F in the fluid(s). The relationship between mCl and flCl indicates that low-density vapor and dense brine phases might have coexisted in some experiments. The relationship between mCl and flCl at 1000 °C is similar to that determined at 845–865 °C, implying that variations of temperature in the range 850–1000 °C have no significant effect on the partitioning of Cl between fluid and phonolitic melt.

The concentration of F in phonolitic melt coexisting with F-rich fluid(s) reaches at least 0.9 wt.{\%} at 845–865 °C and 1.3 wt.{\%} at 1000 °C. The comparison of data from experiments conducted in Au and Pt capsules indicates that F may react with Au, which influences the quality of the experimental results. The partition coefficients of F between bulk fluid and melt (fl/mDF) are higher than 1 in all experiments, indicating that fluorine is preferentially incorporated into the fluid phase in phonolitic systems, in contrast to fl/mDF values determined in rhyolitic systems. The influence of Cl on fl/mDF is not detectable at the conditions of our experiments. The experimental data imply that Mt. Somma–Vesuvius phonolitic magmas from the eruptions between A.D. 79 and A.D. 1944 may have coexisted with Cl-rich and F-rich fluid phase(s) prior to eruption.},

abstract = {The mineralogy and petrology of banded pumice clasts from a mixed-magma non-welded ignimbrite on Tenerife, Canary Islands, is described. Phenocrysts, which frequently show signs of resorption, are grouped into three assemblages in mutual disequilibrium; these assemblages were originally precipitated by alkali basalt magma (assemblage 1, titanaugite + olivine + calcic plagioclase + high-Mg Fe–Ti oxides), trachyandesitic magma (assemblage 2, salite + kaersutite + sodic plagioclase + hauyne + medium-Mg Fe–Ti oxides) and phonolitic magma (assemblage 3, aegirine-augite + biotite + sodic sanidine + sodalite + nepheline + sphene + low-Mg magnetite) respectively. Phenocryst types (e.g. clinopyroxene, feldspar) which are common to two or all assemblages are compositionally distinctive in each. The excess silica content of nepheline in assemblage 3 indicates a temperature of 770 °C for phonolitic magma, while Fe–Ti oxides and clinopyroxene-ilmenite give temperatures of 915 °C and 907 °C respectively for the trachyandesite. Assemblage 1 and 2 phenocrysts are set in mafic glass; assemblage 3 phenocrysts are only found in a matrix of salic (phonolitic) glass. Analyses of the volumetrically dominant phonolitic glass define a compositional trend consistent with fractionation of assemblage 3 phenocrysts. Analyses of the mafic glass scatter about a straight-line trend produced by mixing of phonolitic liquid with homogeneous intermediate (trachyandesitic) magma. These relations are interpreted as the result of two distinct magma mixing events, consequent on the invasion of a stably zoned magma chamber containing phonolitic liquid stratified above denser trachyandesitic magma, by intruding basaltic magma. High Ca content of assemblage 1 plagioclase suggests precipitation of the basaltic phenocrysts under locally high partial pressure of water. The preferred model involves, in chronological sequence: (i) generation of a differentiated phonolitic cap above trachyandesitic magma, through wall crystallization and boundary-layer uprise of phonolite; (ii) pooling, convective heat loss, and partial crystallization of dense, hydrous alkali basalt magma injected into the chamber and forming a liquid layer beneath the trachyandesitic magma; (iii) volatile saturation of the residual basalt liquid through crystallization, consequent buoyant uprise into, and efficient mixing with, trachyandesite; (iv) eruption of chamber contents and partial mixing of the mixed basalt–trachyandesite with phonolite, although the precise relative timing of eruption and the second mixing event is not known.},

abstract = {Melt viscosity affects virtually all aspects of igneous petrogenesis. Although addition of H2O is known to lower melt viscosities, addition of fluorine is controversial and may raise them. Because these two volatiles most commonly reach their highest concentrations in granitic rocks, the viscosities of peralkaline, strongly peraluminous, and weakly peraluminous granitic melts with approximately 1.5 wt{\%} F and 6 wt{\%} H2O were measured to investigate the combined effects of H2O and F on granitic melt viscosities when those volatiles are present at natural concentration levels. Viscosities were measured between 800 and 1000° C at 1.0 GPa with the falling sphere technique in a piston-cylinder apparatus. Viscosities of all melts studied behave in an Arrhenius manner and can be described by the following equations: Peralkaline $\eta$ = 2.70 ± 0.21 × 10 − 6 exp ⁡ ( 181.9 ± 1.0 / RT ) Metalminous $\eta$ = 4.54 ± 0.44 × 10 − 7 exp ⁡ ( 213.8 ± 1.0 / RT ) Peraluminous $\eta$ = 2.60 ± 0.25 × 10 − 8 exp ⁡ ( 242.8 ± 1.0 / RT ) where viscosity is in units of Pa s and the activation energy is in kJ/mol;R is the gas constant, in J mol−1 K−1, andT is temperature in Kelvin. Uncertainties are 1 standard errors based upon estimated uncertainties, ±5 relative {\%}, in the viscosity measurements. Viscosities of these melts with high volatile contents can be well estimated with existing viscosity models. Viscosities of the peraluminous melts studied are similar to those of hydrous granitic melts containing water concentrations equal to the total of H2O + F in the melts studied. All volatile-bearing per- and metaluminous granitic melts display a rapid (6 to 7 orders of magnitude) drop in viscosity with the first 3 wt{\%} volatiles added followed by only an additional factor of two decrease in viscosity as the volatile concentration is increased from 3 to 12 wt{\%}. The peralkaline melt displays viscosities significantly below those of all other volatile-bearing, per- and metaluminous melts previously studied. The lower viscosities of peralkaline granitic melts allow them to separate more rapidly from their source regions, be transported through conduits at a velocity approximately an order of magnitude faster, and experience more efficient crystallization-fractionation than per- and metaluminous granitic melts.},

abstract = {New major and trace element analyses of plagioclase and clinopyroxene in gabbros from the
Skaergaard intrusion are used to understand the mechanisms of crystallization in the main magma
body and in the crystal mush. Crystal cores show a continuous chemostratigraphic evolution in the
Layered Series, with compatible elements (e.g. Cr and Ni in clinopyroxene) being progressively
depleted from the bottom up, whereas incompatible elements (e.g. Sr, Ba, REE in plagioclase and
clinopyroxene) become progressively enriched. We performed numerical models and showed that
these trends can be explained by a simple process of fractional crystallization, except for the upper
20{\%} of the intrusion where plagioclase and clinopyroxene trace element compositions depart from
fractional crystallization trends. At this stage of magma chamber solidification, fractional crystallization
becomes less efficient and is replaced by a major proportion of in situ equilibrium crystallization.
Trace elements also show significant variations in interstitial overgrowths on plagioclase
and clinopyroxene cumulus crystals. They result from crystallization of the interstitial liquid in the
liquid þ crystal mush. However, incompatible elements, and especially REE, show a degree of enrichment
in plagioclase rims ({\textgreater} 20 ppm Ce) that strongly exceeds the highest concentrations
observed in plagioclase cores (up to 4 ppm Ce) at the top of the Layered Series. Such a strong enrichment
is difficult to reconcile with a simple process of fractional crystallization of the interstitial
liquid in the crystal mush, but may be related to the development of silicate liquid immiscibility in
the crystal mush or to delayed nucleation of apatite. After the crystallization of plagioclase and
clinopyroxene overgrowths, diffusive re-equilibration during a period of 01–025 Myr significantly
changed the original zoning profiles. Ce flux from clinopyroxene into the plagioclase lattice of adjacent
crystals could also have contributed to the strong Ce enrichment observed in plagioclase
rims.},

abstract = {The Doros Complex is a relatively small (maximum 3.5. km. ×. 7.5. km) shallow-level, lopolithic, layered mafic intrusion in the early Cretaceous Paran{\'{a}}-Etendeka Large Igneous Province. The stratigraphy broadly comprises a minor, fine-grained gabbroic sill and a sequence of primitive olivine-cumulate melagabbros, with a basal chilled margin, an intermediate plagioclase-cumulate olivine gabbro, and a sequence of mineralogically and texturally variable, intermediate, strongly foliated, plagioclase-, olivine- or magnetite-cumulate gabbros. An evolved syenitic (bostonite) phase occurs as cross-cutting dykes or as enclaves within the foliated gabbros. Major element modelling of the liquid line of descent shows that the spectrum of rock types, including the bostonite, is consistent with the fractionation of a basaltic parental magma that crystallised olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, magnetite, K-feldspar and apatite. However, the stratigraphic succession does not correspond to a simple progressive differentiation trend but instead shows a series of punctuated trends, each defined by a compositional reversal or hiatus. Incompatible trace element concentrations do not increase upwards though the body of the intrusion. The major units show similar, mildly enriched rare earth element patterns, with minimal Eu anomalies. Back-calculation of the rare earth element concentrations of these cumulate rocks produces relatively evolved original liquid compositions, indicating fractionation of this liquid from a more primitive precursor.Based on combined field, petrographic, geochemical and geophysical evidence, we propose an origin for the Doros Complex by a minimum of seven closely spaced influxes of crystal-bearing magmas, each with phenocryst contents between 5{\%} and 55{\%}. These findings represent a departure from the traditional single-pulse liquid model for the formation of layered mafic intrusions and suggest the presence of an underlying magmatic mush column, i.e., a large, complex system of interconnected conduits and staging chambers that host a range of co-existing magmas of different compositions and crystal contents.},

abstract = {Elephant Island is an outcrop of the South Shetland Block, and is located at the southeastern prolongation of the Shackleton Fracture Zone. The South Shetland Block constitutes a continental fragment of the southern branch of the Scotia Arc and has been separated since the Pliocene from the Antarctic Peninsula by the opening of the Bransfield Strait and the transtensional fault zone that extends along the South Scotia Ridge. The northern boundary of the block is determined by subduction at the South Shetland Trench and its eastwards prolongation. The Shackleton Fracture Zone extends up to the South Shetland Block and constitutes the westernmost segment of the Scotia-Antarctic plate boundary. In this tectonic context, Elephant Island permits study of the rocks and the structures that resulted from deformation of the South Shetland Block near the triple junction with the Antarctic and Scotia Plates. Several lines of evidence point to important and recent uplift of Elephant Island: presence of HP/LT metamorphic rocks, marine terraces, and high relief. This is the consequence of at least two processes: subduction of the thickened crust related to the Shackleton Fracture Zone that produced local crustal thickening and post glacial isostatic rebound. This paper reports the results of a study of brittle structures in the western and southern cliffs of Elephant Island. It is shown that recent stresses were variable, in accordance with the tectonic setting. The northwestern sectors are dominated by compression with NE-SW and NW-SE trends respectively related to the Scotia-Antarctic sinistral transcurrence and to subduction of the oceanic lithosphere that was modified in the vicinity of the Shackleton Fracture Zone. In the southern sector, extension predominates with approximately WNW-ESE trend, related to Bransfield Strait opening and transtensional faults located along the South Scotia Ridge. In addition, radial extension has been identified in different sectors that may be related to the uplift of the island.},

abstract = {We derive an estimate for the chemical composition of the depleted MORB mantle (DMM), the source reservoir to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which represents at least 30{\%} the mass of the whole silicate Earth. A database for the chemical and physical properties of abyssal peridotites has become robust and complete enough to truly access a reference DMM. Using trace element depletion trends from the abyssal peridotites, it is possible to construct a large part of DMM's trace element pattern. Splicing this information with isotopic constraints (Sr–Nd–Pb–Hf) and canonical ratios (Ce/Pb, Nb/Ta, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, H2O/Ce, CO2/Nb and Cl/K), we can extend abundance estimates to all the incompatible elements including volatile content. The resulting trace element pattern for average DMM constrains parental MORB to be generated by 6{\%} aggregated fractional melting, consistent with recent models for hydrous melting of the mantle [P.D. Asimow, J.E. Dixon, C.H. Langmuir, A hydrous melting and fractionation model for mid-ocean ridge basalts: application to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Azores, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 5 (2004) 10.1029/2003GC000568]. We show that DMM is roughly balanced by the continental crust and better balanced upon inclusion of ocean island basalt source and oceanic crust components. Compared to the primitive mantle, DMM has been depleted by 2–3{\%} melt extraction and has only 15{\%} the radiogenic heat production.},

abstract = {The parameters which control the behaviour of isovalent trace elements in magmatic and aqueous systems have been investigated by studying the distribution of yttrium, rare-earth elements (REEs), zirconium, and hafnium. If a geochemical system is characterized by CHArge-and-RAdius-Controlled (CHARAC) trace element behaviour, elements of similar charge and radius, such as the Y-Ho and Zr-Hf twin pairs, should display extremely coherent behaviour, and retain their respective chondritic ratio. Moreover, normalized patterns of REE(III) should be smooth functions of ionic radius and atomic number. Basic to intermediate igneous rocks show Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios which are close to the chondritic ratios, indicating CHARAC behaviour of these elements in pure silicate melts. In contrast, aqueous solutions and their precipitates show non-chondritic Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios. An important process that causes trace element fractionation in aqueous media is chemical complexation. The complexation behaviour of a trace element, however, does not exclusively depend on its ionic charge and radius, but is additionally controlled by its electron configuration and by the type of complexing ligand, since the latter two determine the character of the chemical bonding (covalent vs electrostatic) in the various complexes. Hence, in contrast to pure melt systems, aqueous systems are characterized by non-CHARAC trace element behaviour, and electron structure must be considered as an important additional parameter. Unlike other magmatic rocks, highly evolved magmas rich in components such as H2O, Li, B, F, P, and/or Cl often show non-chondritic Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios, and “irregular” REE patterns which are sub-divided into four concave-upward segments referred to as “tetrads”. The combination of non-chondritic Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios and lanthanide tetrad effect, which cannot be adequately modelled with current mineral/melt partition coefficients which are smooth functions of ionic radius, reveals that non-CHARAC trace element behaviour prevails in highly evolved magmatic systems. The behaviour of high field strength elements in this environment is distinctly different from that in basic to intermediate magmas (i.e. pure silicate melts), but closely resembles trace element behaviour in aqueous media. “Anomalous” behaviour of Y and REEs, and of Zr and Hf, which are hosted by different minerals, and the fact that these minerals show “anomalous” trace element distributions only if they crystallized from highly evolved magmas, indicate that non-CHARAC behaviour is a reflection of specific physicochemical properties of the magma. This supports models which suggest that high-silica magmatic systems which are rich in H2O, Li, B, F, P, and/or Cl, are transitional between pure silicate melts and hydrothermal fluids. In such a transitional system non-CHARAC behaviour of high field strength elements may be due to chemical complexation with a wide variety of ligands such as non-bridging oxygen, F, B, P, etc., leading to absolute and relative mineral/melt or mineral/aqueous-fluid partition coefficients that are extremely sensitive to the composition and structure of this magma. Hence, any petrogenetic modelling of such magmatic rocks, which utilizes partition coefficients that have not been determined for the specific igneous suite under investigation, may be questionable. But Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios provide information on whether or not the evolution of felsic igneous rocks can be quantitatively modelled: samples showing non-chondritic Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios or even the lanthanide tetrad effect should not be considered for modelling. However, the most important result of this study is that Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios may be used to verify whether Y, REEs, Zr, and Hf in rocks or minerals have been deposited from or modified by silicate melts or aqueous fluids.},

abstract = {Zircon crystals were grown from a Li-Mo flux (7.5 mol{\%} Li2MoO4; 86.5 mol{\%} MoO3) to which equal molar proportions ZrO2 and Li2SiO3 were added (3 mol{\%} each). The crystals were initially grown undoped, but later Dy was added to the flux without any other charge-compensating species. With Dy and P added, in equal molar proportions, the zircon crystals incorporated 1.37 mol{\%} (6.99 wt{\%}) Dy and 1.36 mol{\%} (1.33 wt{\%}) P, a factor of 5.3 increase in Dy over the crystals grown without P intentionally added to the flux. The other P+REE-doped zircon crystals displayed an approximately 1000-fold increase in REE and P from La through Lu, a result of decreasing ionic radii. The incorporation of P5+ allowed, in a general sense, the xenotime-type coupled substitution of (REE3+, Y3+) + P5+ = Zr4+ + Si4+. From La to Nd, however, P exceeds REE, from Sm to Gd, the REE are generally equal to P, and from Tb to Lu the REE exceed P. The Y- and P-doped zircon behaved more like middle-REE (MREE)-doped zircon than heavy-REE (HREE)-doped zircon crystals in their ability to incorporate Y (and P) and to maintain charge neutrality. To investigate the incorporation of Dy with no P added to the flux, the P to LREE excess, and the HREE to P excess in the doped zircon, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses were completed on selected crystals. In the Dy-doped crystals, the SIMS analyses revealed minor amounts of P, Li, and Mo in the crystals. These elements contributed to charge balance required by the excess Dy. In REE- and P-doped zircon, the SIMS analyses detected Li and Mo, and the Li and Mo may also provide charge balance for excess REE in the HREE+P-doped crystals.},

abstract = {The Oman ophiolite exposes a large and well-preserved mantle section beneath a palaeo-spreading centre. The mantle section is mainly composed of extremely refractory harzburgites with relatively homogeneous modal and major element compositions. Nevertheless, our trace element data exhibit variations connected with the main mantle structures, which allow us to define three geochemical and structural domains. The main harzburgitic mantle section, mainly constituted of strongly refractory harzburgites characterised by chondrite-normalised REE patterns that are steadily depleted from HREE to LREE. These rocks are interpreted as mantle residues after {\textgreater}15{\%} melt extraction. Their REE signature can be explained by melt transport associated with partial melting. The diapir areas (mainly the Maqsad diapir), defined by plunging lineations. They are constituted of harzburgites with roughly the same modal composition as the main mantle section but distinct, concave-upward REE patterns. The regions of most active upwelling (characterised by sub-vertical lineations) are further distinguished by higher Al2O3/CaO ratios and TiO2 contents. This character is ascribed to focused partial melt upwelling. The diapirs are interpreted as local instabilities in upwelling mantle, possibly triggered by feedback mechanisms between deformation and melt percolation. The Maqsad diapir is topped by a thick, dunitic, mantle–crust transition zone (MTZ) that displays the same trace-element signature as the diapir. However, the dunites are distinguished by low Mg{\#} values and Ni contents. Together with structural evidence, this allows us to interpret the MTZ dunites as diapir harzburgites that were strongly modified by olivine-forming melt–rock reactions at high melt/rock ratios. The MTZ is thought to act as a major collecting zone for mantle melts. The cpx-harzburgites from the base of the mantle section. These rocks are distinguished by high clinopyroxene contents ({\textgreater}5{\%}), low AL2O3/CaO and ‘spoon-shaped' REE patterns. They were individualised from the rest of the harzburgite mantle section by a cpx-forming melt–rock reaction at decreasing malt mass. This reaction probably occurred at near-solidus conditions along the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary. The formation of these three domains may be integrated in a geodynamic scenario involving the reactivation of an oceanic lithosphere, a process that would be related to the ridge propagator identified in the Oman ophiolite.},

abstract = {The central Kenya peralkaline province comprises five young ({\textless} 1 Ma) volcanic complexes dominated by peralkaline trachytes and rhyolites. The geological and geochemical evolution of each complex is described and issues related to the development of peralkalinity in salic magmas are highlighted. The peralkaline trachytes may have formed by fractionation of basaltic magma via metaluminous trachyte and in turn generated pantellerite by the same mechanism. Comenditic rhyolites are thought to have formed by volatile-induced crustal anatexis and may themselves have been parental to pantelleritic melts by crystal fractionation. The rhyolites record very low temperatures of equilibration (≤ 700 °C) at low fO2 (≤ FMQ). The development of compositional zonation within the magma reservoirs has been ubiquitous, involving up to tens of cubic km of magma at timescales of 103–104 years. Magma mixing has also been commonplace, sometimes between adjacent centres. Isotopic evidence relating to rates and timescales of pre-eruptive residence times and crystal fractionation processes is summarized.},

The lowermost unit, the Poladpur Formation, is characterized by high Ba, Rb, and Zr/Nb, and low Sr. These features are accompained by high K and Si, high and variable [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7043-0.7196), and low and variable [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} values (+2.6 to -17.4). The formation is interpreted as having developed by contamination of the overlying Ambenali magma-type with ancient granitic crust, with simultaneous fractionation of a gabbroic mineral assemblage. The more basic members of the formation are found towards the base of the succession and are more contaminated than the upper flows. The succeeding Ambenali Formation, characterized by the Ambenali magma type, has low Ba, Rb, Sr and Zr/Nb, and low and rather uniform [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7038-0.7043) coupled with high and relatively uniform [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} (+4.7 to +6.4). It is interpreted as being essentially uncontaminated and derived from a mantle source with a history of slight trace-element enrichment relative to m.o.r.b.-source. The uppermost group of flows, the Mahabaleshwar Formation, is, like the Poladpur, enriched in Ba, Rb, K and Si relative to the Ambenali, but has lower Zr/Nb and higher Sr. [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7040-0.7056) are slightly higher than in the Ambenali, and [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} lies in the range +7.1 to -3.0. In this formation Sr correlates positively with the other incompatible elements and with [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios. This is in strong contrast to the relations observed in the Poladpur, and we believe that the behaviour of Sr may be a simple pointer to the distinction between mantle and crustal contributions. Assuming that late-stage crystal fractionation processes can be allowed for, if Sr correlates positively with elements such as K, Rb and Ba then mantle enrichment processes are clearly implied. Conversely, as for example in the Poladpur, if the correlation is negative, crustal contamination is suspected because Sr is unlikely to behave as an incompatible element in most crustal derived melts or fluids because of buffering by residual plagioclase. Furthermore, the relative uniformity of the Mahabaleshwar Formation, the position on the Sr and Nd isotope diagram close to the `mantle array', the fact that in terms of both incompatible element concentrations and isotopes the rocks are similar to tholeiites from oceanic islands such as Hawaii and Kerguelen, are all factors that reinforce the conclusion that these are mantle derived magmas which have suffered insignificant crustal contamination. They are, however, derived from a mantle which is trace-element enriched relative to the Ambenali source. Thus in the succession as a whole the crustal contribution appears to be small. Maximum amounts of contamination in the Poladpur Formation are difficult to determine but the average amount is probably in the region of 6-12 percentage mass. The whole sequence therefore contains a crustal contribution of about 2-3{\%}.},

abstract = {The latest cycle of volcanism on Tenerife has involved the construction of two stratovolcanoes, Teide and Pico Viejo (PV), and numerous flank vent systems on the floor of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera, which has been partially infilled by magmatic products of the basanite-phonolite series. The only known substantial post-caldera explosive eruption occurred ∼2 ka bp from satellite vents at Monta{\~{n}}a Blanca (MB), to the east of Teide and at PV. The MB eruption began with extrusion of ≈0.022 km3 of phonolite lava (unit I) from a WNW-ESE fissure system. The eruption then entered an explosive subplinian phase. Over a 7–11 hour period, 0.25 km3 (DRE) of phonolitic pumice (unit II) was deposited from a 15 km high subplinian column, dispersed to the NE by 10 m/s winds. Pyroclastic activity also occurred from vents near PV to the west of Teide. Fire-fountaining towards the end of the explosive phase formed a proximal welded spatter facies. The eruption closed with extrusion of small volume domes and lavas (≈0.025 km3) at both vent systems. Geochemical, petrological data and Fe-Ti oxide geothermometry indicate the eruption of a chemically and thermally stratified magma system. The most mafic and hottest (≈875°C) unit I magma can yield the more evolved and cooler (755–825°C) phonolites of units II and III by between 7 and 11{\%} fractional crystallization of an assemblage dominated by alkali feldspar. Analyses of glass inclusions from phenocrysts by ion microprobe show that the pumice was derived from the water-saturated roof zone of a chamber containing 3.0–4.5 wt.{\%} H2O and abundant halogens (F≈0.35wt.{\%}). Hotter, more mafic tephritic magma intermingled with the evolved phonolites in banded pumice, indicating the injection of mafic magma into the system during or just before eruption. Reconstruction ot the event indicates a small chamber chemically stratified by in situ (side-wall) crystallization at a depth of 3–4 km below PV. Although phonolite is the dominant product of the youngest activity of the Teide-PV system, there has been no eruption of phonolitic magma for at least 500 years from teide itself and for ∼2000 years from the PV system. Therefore there could be a large volume of highly evolved, volatile-rich magma accumulating in these magma systems. An eruption of fluorine-rich magma comparable with MB would have major damaging effects on the island.},

abstract = {Geochemical and petrological investigations were carried out on ultrabasic silicate and carbonatite magmatic rocks from {\v{Z}} . the Blue Hills Intrusive Complex southern Namibia . From detailed field mapping and geomagnetic traverses we propose a model for the complex build-up of this hypabyssal laccolith. The bulk comprises mica–olivine–carbonate picrite, with numerous small offshoots into the surrounding Nama shales which are metamorphosed at the contacts to the intrusive rock. The mica–olivine–carbonate picrite is intruded by small lenses and massive layers of monticellite picrite. Locally, a phlogopite–carbonate picrite occurs, that cuts through both the monticellite picrite and the mica–olivine–carbonate picrite. Late carbonatite dykes and sills and a carbonate–phlogopite–apatite pegmatite represent the last stage of the Blue Hills magmatism. Phlogopite–carbonate picrites are regarded as the parental and nearly primary magmas. They may be formed by partial melting in the dolomite stability field at a depth of 100 to 110 km and at a temperature of 1100–12508C. Fractional crystallisation of mostly olivine led to formation of the volatile-rich, mica–olivine–carbonate picrites, which were the first to intrude into the present position of the Blue Hills Intrusive Complex. Part of the phlogopite–carbonate picrite magma intruded undifferentiated, while part of it suffered devolatilisation and oxidation on its way to the surface which led to formation of the monticellite picrites. Both magma types intruded the hypabyssal mica–olivine–carbonate picrite. The late carbonatites most probably are residual liquids, i.e. the result of almost complete solidification of magmas like phlogopite– carbonate picrites. The carbonatitic liquids were removed from the crystal mush by filter pressing. Pegmatitic veins are the late stage residual fluids or melts from within the Blue Hills body. q},

abstract = {The islands of La Palma and El Hierro form the western end of the hotspot-induced Canary Islands chain. Both islands are at present in the earliest and fastest shield-building stage of growth and show many similarities with the Hawaiian Islands. La Palma shows two very distinct phases of volcanic construction: (1) a Pliocene submarine volcanic and intrusive series, interpreted as an uplifted seamount at least 1500 m above present sea level, and (2) a subaerial volcanic series erupted in the past 2 m.y. Taburiente volcano initially formed the northern part of the island and then extended to the south, forming a ridge (Cumbre Nueva Ridge) that was partially destroyed about 560 ka by a giant lateral collapse (the Cumbre Nueva collapse), possibly involving 180–200 km3 of subaerial volcanic material. The northwest boundary of the Cumbre Nueva collapse formed a vertical scarp that, enlarged by headward erosion, formed the spectacular depression of Caldera de Taburiente. Cumbre Vieja volcano, a north-south elongated rift, forms the southern half of La Palma and constitutes its last stage of growth, including all eruptive activity in the past 125 k.y. Detailed field observations, mapping, and high-precision radiometric dating have allowed reconstruction of the growth and structural changes of the Cumbre Vieja volcano. Interactions between eruption rates, coastal erosion, and glacio-eustatic sea level change allow stratigraphic subdivision of the edifice. The structure of the volcano has been controlled for most of its history by a rift system with a clearly dominant north-south and less-distinct north-east and north-west volcanic rift zones. The rift reorganization of the volcano to a single north-south rift since 7 ka and the opening of faults during the 1949 eruption probably reflect increasing instability of the west flank of the volcano.},

abstract = {Oceanic island basalts are thought to originate from partial melting of lithologically heterogeneous mantle. Sobolev and coworkers proposed the use of fractionation-corrected Ni concentration Ni × (FeO/MgO) and Fe/Mn measured in olivine as indicators of pyroxenite-derived component in mixtures of primary melts. Trace element concentrations were measured in olivine from two historical eruptions in Lanzarote (Canary Islands), which erupted mafic and mantle nodule bearing magmas, ranging in composition from highly silica-undersaturated basanites through alkali basalts to tholeiites. Tephra from each of the five eruption phases of the 1730–36 CE Timanfaya eruption contains olivine phenocrysts with cores with restricted Fo variation ({\~{}} 3 mol{\%}), whereas trace element concentrations and ratios vary by a factor of approximately two. The largest variation is observed in early basanites with later eruption phases producing olivine macrocrysts containing trace elements within that range. Ni × (FeO/MgO) and Fe/Mn of olivine in the basanites span the whole range of olivine in MORB and OIB worldwide, whereas the olivine of subsequent phases has values akin to those crystallized from pyroxenite melts. The Fo content decreases systematically with time during the 1730–36 eruption and the proportion of silica-saturated primary melt increased in the parental magma mixture with time. At the end of the eruption, tholeiite magmas crystallized olivine with lower Fo content, whereas the concentrations of Mn and Ca increased together with Ca/Al at relatively uniform Ni × (FeO/MgO) and Fe/Mn, all of which is readily explained by increased decompression melting at lower temperature. The basanite from the eruption that took place in 1824 CE has olivine with even higher Fo content and trace element variability similar to that of the Timanfaya basanite. The fact that the Lanzarote basanites contain olivine with trace element systematic spanning that of MORB and pyroxenite melt can be explained by CO2-flux melting of a lithologically heterogeneous source, generating the diverse compositions. Alternatively, reactive porous flow through depleted oceanic lithosphere and equilibration with dunitic restite caused Ni depletion of percolating pyroxenite melt from which olivine of the basanites crystallized. The fact that olivine compositions and basanite magma were reproduced approximately a century later may reflect episodic carbonatic fluxing in the slowly uprising Canarian mantle plume.},

abstract = {This paper is an updated overview, including many new data, of what is known about Italian alkaline–carbonatite complexes, plus a new description of a carbothermal residua-related district, and its potential for mineral deposits. The Italian carbonatite occurrences can be divided into two belts. The first is a 350 km long and 75 km wide belt along the Apennines mountain range mainly with primary extrusive carbonatites generally from monogenic volcanoes and from the Vulture volcanic complex; the second belt is 60 km long and 20 km wide in the Northern Latium region in which carbothermal residua carbonatites and fluorite mineralisation deposited by high-temperature fluids rich in CO2, SO2and fluorine are occurring in caldera volcanoes. Several of the raw materials, such as Light Rare Earth Elements, vanadium, niobium, zirconium, fluorite and phosphate are identified as critical as well as other commodities, occur in Italian carbonatites and alkaline rocks. At the Pianciano quarry (Bracciano) fluorite-rich ore (fluor-ore = fluorite in a mineralised gangue) is actually exploited as flux for cement, but Rare Earth Elements (+ V) could be a notable by-product (300,000 metric tonnes, equivalent to 4.2{\%} of European resources). Pyrochlore, monazite, apatite, and britholite bearing subvolcanic rocks in ejecta from the Vulture volcano are of a near-economic grade, but their geological constraints are not known. A conceptual framework of combined geological and geochemical data improves the general understanding of this regional magmatic system, aimed at laying the foundations of a future geological model disclosing unrecognised potential exploration targets. However, this paper is not intended for direct use by the exploration industry; rather it is principally aimed at mineralogists and petrologists who could develop strategies for the identification of unexposed or unrecognised deposits.},

abstract = {Miocene Ignimbrite 'A' on Gran Canaria contains three compositional endmember fiamme types(two rhyolites and one trachyte) each of which crystallized distinct feldspar. Various textural and compositional criteria are interpreted as reflecting a complex scenario within the magma chamber in which the crystals formed. About 25-30{\%} of the feldspar phenocrysts contain evidence for magma mixing in the form of (1) partial to severe dissolution-resorption rims, (2) distinct zones of drastically different compositions and (3) overgrowth textures on formerly resorbed crystals. Four major types of zoning in the oligoclase to anorthoclase feldspars of ignimbrite 'A' include a normal and a reversely zoned type and two complexly zoned types. The feldspars with normal and reverse zonation show only minor compositional amplitudes between individual zones ({\{}Delta{\}}Ab, Or[{\~{}}] 4{\%}), whereas the complexly zoned types show compositional differences between zones of up to 18 mol {\%} Ab and 20 mol {\%} Or and are commonly associated with an internal dissolution surface. Complex zoning with large compositional amplitudes and dissolution textures is taken as evidence of crystal movements within the magma and across compositional boundaries between magma batches. A multiple 'step-cycle' model, involving growth and transport of a crystal into another magma batch and its return to the original host magma, is suggested by the data. Moreover, feldspars from one rhyolite compositional group are found to be substantially elevated in{\{}delta{\}} 18O, suggesting an input of a high{\{}delta{\}} 18O component to this rhyolite. The other endmember rhyolite appears to be related to the endmember trachyte by mainly crystal fractionation of anorthoclase feldspar. This observation is consistent with trace element and rare earth element concentrations for the magma endmembers and their feldspars, where contamination led to a depletion in incompatible trace elements and light rare earth elements in the contaminated rhyolite and its feldspar phenocrysts. We suggest that the combination of textural and compositional variation in ternary feldspar of peralkaline rhyolitic systems is well suited to reconstruct dynamic processes such as magma mixing and contamination in evolving rhyolitic magma chambers},

abstract = {Gas emissions from Erebus volcano, Antarctica, were measured by open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to understand degassing of its magmatic system. Two degassing phonolite lava lakes were present in the summit crater during observation in December 2004. We report analyses of H2O, CO2, CO, SO2, HF, HCl and OCS, (in order of molar abundance) in the plumes. Variations in the proportions of these species strongly reflect the dynamics of degassing, and sourcing of gas from different depths in the magmatic network. The highest observed ratios of CO2 and H2O are consistent with gas extracted from the melt at a depth of up to ∼ 2 km below the lava lakes. Magma degassing above this depth contributes to a higher H2O/CO2 proportion in the airborne plume. The ratio therefore reflects the balance of deeper vs. shallower contributions of volatiles and, possibly, a combination of closed- and open-system degassing. We observe a strong contrast in HF content in emissions from the two lava lakes, which we attribute to differing levels of magma ascent and/or cooling and crystallization of the magma supply. Fluxes of all gas species were determined using independent SO2 flux determinations and measured gas ratios. In the case of CO2 and water, ∼ 1 and ∼ 0.4 m3 s− 1, respectively, of parental basanite magma are required to sustain the calculated output. The discrepancy between the two figures is readily explained by sequestration of part of the magma supply at depth such that it only partially degasses its complement of water.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal experiments were conducted with molten Mt. Somma-Vesuvius phonolite and mixed-composition fluids comprised of O-H-Cl-S-cations to determine the solubilities and melt-fluid(s) partitioning behavior of the dominant volatile components at 896-1022 °C, 200 MPa, and fO2of NNO +0.54 to NNO + 1.6. The final melt compositions ranged from phonolitic to trachytic due to component exchange between the melt and fluid(s) and limited crystallization of plagioclase and iron-titanium oxides. The Cl concentration of the fluids was measured directly and confirmed by mass-balance calculation, and the S concentration of the fluids was determined by mass-balance computations involving a new technique based on the mass loss of CaSO4crystals which served as the primary S source in the starting experimental charges. These experiments determine the apparent molal solubility of CaSO4in NaCl-, KCl-, and CaCl2-enriched fluids to be:[mC a S O 4= 71.52 (X(N a, K) C lC a S O 4 - freefluids) - 1.61] at 200 MPa and ca . 920 °C . The concentration of Cl in these melts increases with temperature and the Cl, CaO, and FeO concentrations of the system; Cl concentration decreases with increasing S in the system. The fluid(s)/melt partition coefficients for Cl, DCl, range from ca. 3-50 and vary with the Cl S, and FeO concentrations of the system and the molar (Na2O/Na2O + K2O) of the melt. The concentration of S in the melts increases with temperature, the S content of the system, the CaO content of the melt, the (S6+/Stotal)melt, and with fO2. The fluid/melt partition coefficients for S, DS, range from 2 to nearly 1100, but most range from 50-300. DSincreases with increasing S in the system just as DClincreases with increasing Cl in the system, and DSincreases with the Larson Index of the melt. The concentration of H2O in these melts increases significantly with increasing Cl, S, and cations in the fluids. These new partition coefficients have been integrated with the results of Raleigh fractionation modeling of Mt. Somma-Vesuvius magmas [that underwent plinian to subplinian eruptions in ca. 3550 a.B.P. (Avellino), AD 79 (Pompeii), and AD 472 (Pollena)] to compute the compositions of magmatic fluids exsolved at 200 MPa. The magmas range from phonotephritic to phonolitic compositions. The modeled Somma-Vesuvius fluids contain from 3 to ca. 50 wt.{\%} Cl and 4-17 wt.{\%} S with 1 to 4 wt.{\%} fluid(s) in the evolving magmas. These concentrations vary strongly with the bulk mass of fluid(s) exsolved and the stage of magma evolution as expressed by the Larson Index. The mass (S/Cl) ratio of these fluids was calculated for 1 wt.{\%} fluid(s) in the magmas, and it ranges from ca. 0.4-4.7 for these modeled conditions. These modeled values are strikingly consistent with the (S/Cl) of gases from numerous subduction-related volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional seismic data from the NW European Atlantic margin provide detailed data on the relationships between sills, dykes, laccoliths and pre-existing basin structure. The data show that sills are predominantly concave-upwards in shape, being complete or partial versions of radially or bilaterally symmetrical forms that possess flat inner saucers connected to a flat outer rim by a steeply inclined sheet. Sills can be sourced from the steep climbing portions of deeper sills, and can be shown to exploit pre-existing faults to feed shallower sills and laccoliths. Magma flow patterns, as revealed by opacity rendering, suggest that sills propagate upwards and outwards away from the magma feeder. As an individual sill can consist of several leaves emplaced at different stratigraphic levels, and as a sill or dyke can provide magma to other sills and laccoliths, the data suggest that neutral buoyancy concepts may not provide a complete explanation for the mechanism and level of sill emplacement. Instead, the data suggest that the presence of ductile horizons such as overpressured shales may permit sill formation below the neutrally buoyant level. Emplacement below the level of neutral buoyancy would permit sill inflation, and the associated fracturing of the country rock would permit magma to exploit these pathways in order to ascend to shallower levels and feed shallower intrusions.},

abstract = {The Palala shear zone is part of a major tectonic lineament in Southern Africa, which extends over 1000km from central Botswana to the Soutpansberg in South Africa. The lineament is situated between the Central Zone of the Limpopo Belt and the Kaapvaal Craton. At its main exposure, in the Koedoesrand Window 50km E of Ellisras, Northern Province, the Palala shear zone comprises a c. 15km wide mylonite zone which can be subdivided into a Northern, Central and Southern Domain. This study addresses the tectono-metamorphic history of the Palala shear zone in the Koedoesrand Window and its role in the tectonics of the Limpopo Belt. In order to do this, structural and petrographical work was combined with geochronology. Age data from relic mineral parageneses show that metapelites from the Central Domain underwent granulite facies metamorphism around 2.6Ga. However, because of an intense Proterozoic overprint, field relationships of the Archean event are largely disrupted. During a second high-grade event at c. 2.0Ga, granulite facies metamorphism was reached in the Northern Domain and the adjacent Limpopo Central Zone. Charnockites were emplaced in the Northern Domain after 2.1Ga and were affected by retrograde amphibolite and greenschist facies metamorphism around 1.97Ga. Post-orogenic transcurrent faulting under (sub)greenschist facies conditions characterizes the Central and Southern domains. Field observations and microstructural investigations indicate a dextral shear sense for the retrograde mylonitisation. These findings document that the Palala shear zone played an important role during the exhumation of the Proterozoic granulites in the Limpopo central zone, associated with a transpressive orogeny between 2.05 and 1.95Ga. Low-grade post-orogenic transcurrent faulting in the Palala shear zone at c. 1.9Ga may be associated with the transtensional opening of the Soutpansberg and Palapye grabens. On the basis of the tectono-metamorphic history in the Koedoesrand Window and regional geophysical, geochemical and sequence-stratigraphic data, the Palala shear zone is interpreted as a Proterozoic suture zone, along which the Archean Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Provinces were juxtaposed.},

A number of halogens (F, Cl and I) were also analysed by electron microprobe. The analyses were used to determine mineral/melt partition coefficients for mica, amphibole, garnet, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and olivine for conditions close to multiple saturation of the basanite liquidus with garnet lherzolite (approximately 2.6 GPa and 1,200°C with 7.5 wt{\%} of added H2O). A broader range of conditions was also investigated from 1.0 GPa and 1,025°C to 3.5 GPa and 1,190°C with 5–10 wt{\%} of added H2O. The scope and comprehensiveness of the data allow them to be used for two purposes, these include the following: an investigation of some of the controlling influences on partition coefficients; and the compilation of a set partition coefficients that are directly relevant to the formation of the Bow Hill basanite magma by partial melting of mantle peridotite. Considering clinopyroxene, the mineral phase for which the most data were obtained, systematic correlations were found between pressure and temperature, mineral composition, cation radius and valence, and $\Delta$G coulb (the coulombic potential energy produced by substituting a cation of mismatched valence into a crystallographic site). $\Delta$G coulb is distinctly different for different crystallographic sites, including the M2 and M1 sites in clinopyroxene. These differences can be modelled as a function of variations in optimum valence (expressed as 1 sigma standard deviations) within individual M1 and M2 site populations.},

abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a toxic element that is emitted to the atmosphere by both human activities and natural processes. Volcanic emissions are considered a natural source of mercury in the environment. In some cases, tree ring records taken close to volcanoes and their relation to volcanic activity over time are contradictory. In 1949, the Hoyo Negro volcano (La Palma-Canary Islands) produced significant pyroclastic flows that damaged the nearby stand of Pinus canariensis. Recently, 60 years after the eruption, we assessed mercury concentrations in the stem of a pine which survived volcano formation, located at a distance of 50 m from the crater. We show that Hg content in a wound caused by pyroclastic impacts (22.3 $\mu$g kg−1) is an order of magnitude higher than the Hg concentrations measured in the xylem before and after the eruption (2.3 $\mu$g kg−1). Thus, mercury emissions originating from the eruption remained only as a mark—in pyroclastic wounds—and can be considered a sporadic and very high mercury input that did not affect the overall Hg input in the xylem. In addition, mercury contents recorded in the phloem (9.5 $\mu$g kg−1) and bark (6.0 $\mu$g kg−1) suggest that mercury shifts towards non-living tissues of the pine, an aspect that can be related to detoxification in volcanism-adapted species.},

abstract = {We have conducted a barometric study of basaltic lavas and mafic to ultramafic xenoliths from Cumbre Vieja volcano (La Palma) in order to reconstruct magma storage, plumbing and related intrusive island growth. The samples were collected both along the volcano's rift zone and from its subaerial and submarine flanks up to 30 km off the rift axis. Clinopyroxene–melt barometry of lavas yields a well-defined pressure range of 410–770 MPa (average 600 MPa) and shows no systematic variation with sample locality. This pressure range reflects a major fractionation level at ca. 15–26 km depth, within the uppermost mantle, where phenocrysts and melt last equilibrated. In contrast, microthermometry of CO2-dominated fluid inclusions in phenocrysts and xenoliths gives pressure estimates of 240 to 470 MPa (average 330 MPa), within the lower oceanic crust. These pressures are interpreted to reflect an underplating zone at 7–14 km depth where ascending magmas become ponded prior to eruption and where passing magmas temporarily stagnate during eruption. The underplating zone is inferred to extend to a radius of ca. 30 km at least, and its depth appears to increase slightly with distance to the rift axis. Our data thus show a remarkable pressure bimodality for long-term and short-term storage of magma that appears to be characteristic for Cumbre Vieja. By using a simple model based on the cumulative volume of material added to the crust, we have estimated uplift rates of {\textgreater} 0.5 m/ka due to underplating that occurs on the island scale. On a time-scale of some 10 ka, these uplift rates are of similar magnitude as global changes in sea-level. A second, more local mode of uplift and related faulting is caused by shallow intrusions into the volcanic edifice as is indicated by the highly irregular morphology of the Cumbre Vieja. We stress that intrusion-related uplift should be qualitatively considered when reconstructing the evolution of oceanic island volcanoes. Since most of the underplated material is inferred to consist of cumulate rocks being intimately mixed and juxtaposed with the lower oceanic crust and having similar densities, it is probably impossible to detect such an underplating zone seismically.},

abstract = {We propose a new plate model for the simulation of trace element transfer during magmatic and metasomatic processes taking place in the Earth's upper mantle. As in previously published plate models, porous flow is accounted for by propagation of fluid batches through macrovolumes of mantle rocks. Being released from spatiotemporal constraints, the plate model allows much more freedom than the one-dimensional porous-flow models for the simulation of fluid-rock interactions. Hence this approach may account for a wide range of mantle processes, including melt extraction during compaction of molten peridotites, porous flow associated with Chromatographic effects, or fluid-rock reactions occurring upon melt infiltration at the base of the conductive mantle. The applications presented in this study show several results consistent with published trace element data for mantle rocks and basaltic volcanism. In particular, the proposed models may provide simple explanations for (1) the ultra-rare-earth-element-depleted composition of peridotites and interstitial melts residual after mid-ocean ridge basalt extraction, (2) the negative correlation between light rare earth element / heavy rare earth element (LREE/HREE) ratio and refractory character of peridotites, as observed in several suites of mantle rocks, and (3) the origin of ultra-LREE-enriched meta-somatic fluids infiltrated in the lithospheric mantle.},

abstract = {An important step in studying volcanic processes is to consider the coeval processes in the subjacent magma reservoir(s). The trachytic caldera volcano Longonot (Kenya Rift Valley) and the K??ngn??t syenite complex (Gardar province, Greenland) are taken to represent complementary magmatic systems, providing evidence of the volcanic and plutonic stages of evolution, respectively. The systems show many features in common; they have similar sizes, experienced two periods of caldera collapse, and were dominated by trachytic magmas, with smaller volumes of basic magma. Magmatic differentiation was dominantly by fractional crystallization of basaltic parents, with minor episodes of magma mixing and, at K??ngn??t, some crustal contamination of parental basalts. A model is presented of a single, hypothetical trachytic centre, showing how evidence from one complex can be used to infer processes at the other. For example, an active convective system, with formation of wall and floor syenitic cumulates, can be inferred to exist in the Longonot magma chamber. At K??ngn??t, the intermittent development of compositionally zoned caps to the magma chamber is postulated and the nature of syn-caldera eruptive activity is outlined. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The North Q{\^{o}}roq Centre is one of four major intrusive centres comprising the Igaliko Nepheline Syenite Coitplex. The centre is composed of a number of syenitic bodies all showing undersaturated character. Emplacement of the bodies was probably by ring fracture and block subsidence, combined with a degree of stoping. Petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical studies have demonstrated that the process of in situ fractionation accounts for the bulk of the variation in rock types seen in the centre.    Clinopyroxene,  olivine, Fe/Ti oxides and apatite were important early fractionating phases, followed by amphibole and biotite.    The most important fractionating phase was, however,  alkali feldspar. Its crystallization and separation resulted in peralkaline undersaturated syenites becoming more peralkaline and more undersaturated. Probe work on the majority of major mineral phases, present in the syenites,  has enabled values to be placedon a number of important physical and chemical parameters. The temperature of the magma as it evolved and the values and effect of steadily varying silica activity, oxygen fugacity, water fugacity,  and activity of sodium disilicate have all been considered. An alkali-rich aqueous phase probably co-existed with the more fractionated of the North Q{\^{o}}roq syenites. A reasonable idea of the nature and composition of this phase has been obtained and a number of features exhibited by the syenites attributed to its action. Influx of meteoric water at an early stage in the evolution of the magmas is suggested as an explanation for the common marginal pegmatites. This process could be instrumental in deciding whether magmas of trachytic composition proceed, with crystal fractionation, towards undersaturated or oversaturated residual compositions.},

abstract = {We present major and trace element and Sr–Nd–Pb–Hf–Os isotopic data for the 76–58 Ma Western Cape melilitite province, an age-progressive magmatic lineation in which primitive olivine melilitite intrusives and alkali basalt lavas have been emplaced on the southwestern margin of South Africa. The magmas range from alkali basalts with strong HIMU isotopic and trace element affinities on the continental shelf to melilitites with kimberlite-like incompatible element compositions and EM 1 isotopic affinities on thick Proterozoic lithosphere (i.e. 87Sr/86Sri = 0{\textperiodcentered}7029–0{\textperiodcentered}7043, $\epsilon$Nd(t) = +5 to +2, 206Pb/204Pbi = 20{\textperiodcentered}5–18{\textperiodcentered}1). The samples are characterized by radiogenic 187Os/188Osi (0{\textperiodcentered}15–0{\textperiodcentered}21) and unradiogenic Hf isotope ratios, causing some of them to fall outside the compositional range of oceanic basalts. This suggests that they tap a mafic HIMU source component that is less dilute than or compositionally different from that tapped by HIMU ocean island basalts. Os–Pb and Nd–Hf isotopic co-variations suggest that the sources of the Western Cape melilitites were generated by a two-stage mixing process in which (1) mafic material (e.g. ancient oceanic crust) underwent solid-state mixing with a small proportion of asthenospheric peridotite and then (2) high-degree melts of this hybrid material mixed with low-degree melts of metasomatized continental lithospheric mantle. A similar process may help to explain the isotopic variations of Group 1 kimberlites, but the available data do not allow us to rule out a major role for convecting mantle components in kimberlite genesis. Using the Western Cape melilitites as an analog, we propose a model in which the strong HIMU isotopic signature present in most Late Cretaceous to Recent alkaline magmatic provinces across Africa is supplied not by conventional mantle plumes, but rather by pods of recycled oceanic crust brought up from the deep mantle within a long-lived, and laterally broad mantle upwelling feature located beneath the African plate.},

abstract = {We review observations and theories of the solar ablation of planetary atmospheres, focusing on the terrestrial case where a large magnetosphere holds off the solar wind, so that there is little direct atmospheric impact, but also couples the solar wind electromagnetically to the auroral zones. We consider the photothermal escape flows known as the polar wind or refilling flows, the enhanced mass flux escape flows that result from localized solar wind energy dissipation in the auroral zones, and the resultant enhanced neutral atom escape flows. We term these latter two escape flows the ``auroral wind.'' We review observations and theories of the heating and acceleration of auroral winds, including energy inputs from precipitating particles, electromagnetic energy flux at magnetohydrodynamic and plasma wave frequencies, and acceleration by parallel electric fields and by convection pickup processes also known as ``centrifugal acceleration.'' We consider also the global circulation of ionospheric plasmas within the magnetosphere, their participation in magnetospheric disturbances as absorbers of momentum and energy, and their ultimate loss from the magnetosphere into the downstream solar wind, loading reconnection processes that occur at high altitudes near the magnetospheric boundaries. We consider the role of planetary magnetization and the accumulating evidence of stellar ablation of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Finally, we suggest and discuss future needs for both the theory and observation of the planetary ionospheres and their role in solar wind interactions, to achieve the generality required for a predictive science of the coupling of stellar and planetary atmospheres over the full range of possible conditions.},

We hope that this short review will encourage more geoscientists to apply X-ray microtomography in their research and that this will lead to new insights into the processes that occur in magmatic (as well as other geological) systems.},

@article{Pik1999,
abstract = {Platinum-group element (PGE) deposits in the Bushveld Complex and other layered intrusions form when large, incompletely solidified magma chambers undergo central subsidence in response to crustal loading, resulting in slumping of semi-consolidated cumulate slurries to the centres of the intrusions and hydrodynamic unmixing of the slurries to form dense layers enriched in sulfides, oxides, olivine and pyroxene and less dense layers enriched in plagioclase. The most economic PGE, Cr and V reefs form in large, multiple-replenished intrusions because these cool relatively slowly and their central portions subside prior to termination of magmatism and complete cumulate solidification. The depth of emplacement has to be relatively shallow as, otherwise, ductile crust would not be able to flex and collapse. In smaller intrusions, cooling rates are faster, subsidence is less pronounced and, where it occurs, the cumulate may be largely solidified, resulting in insignificant mush mobility and mineral sorting. Layering is thus less pronounced and less regular and continuous and the grades of the reefs are lower, but the reefs can be relatively thicker. An additional factor controlling the PGE, Cr and V prospectivity of intrusions is their location within cratons. Intra-cratonic environments offer more stable emplacement conditions that are more amenable to the formation of large, layered igneous bodies. Furthermore, intrusions sited within cratons are more readily preserved because cratons are underlain by thick, buoyant keels of harzburgite that prevent plate tectonic recycling and destruction of crust.},

abstract = {Geochemical data for igneous rocks provide definitive evidence for the occurrence of open-system processes in magma bodies, including Replenishment by intrusion of primitive magma, Assimilation of anatectic wallrock melt and cumulate formation by Fractional Crystallization. A general class of models (Energy Conserved-RAFC or EC-RAFC) can be constructed, which allow simulation of geochemical paths for trace elements and isotopic ratios for magma undergoing simultaneous replenishment, assimilation and fractional crystallization during the approach to thermal equilibration. The general problem of EC-RAFC is formulated as a set of 3 + t + i + s coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where the number of trace elements, radiogenic and stable isotope ratios simultaneously modeled are t, i and s, respectively. Partial melting of wallrock, modeled as fractional melting, is incorporated, as are sensible and latent heat effects. Temperature-dependent partition coefficients are used to describe trace element distributions. Solution of the set of differential equations, with magma temperature ( Tm ) as the independent variable, provides values for the average temperature of wallrock ( Ta ), fraction of melt within the magma body ( Mm ), mass of cumulates ( Mc ) formed, mass of wallrock involved in the thermal interaction ( Ma°), mass of anatectic melt assimilated ( Ma*), the concentration of t trace elements (Cm ) and i + s isotopic ratios ($\epsilon$m) in magma (melt plus cumulates) and in anatectic melt delivered to the evolving magma body. Input parameters include a user-defined equilibration temperature ( Teq ), the initial temperatures and compositions of magma, recharge magma, and wallrock, distribution coefficients and their temperature dependences, heats of fusion and crystallization, and isobaric specific heat capacities of the various constituents. For a priori defined magma recharge mass and Teq, the mass of wallrock heated to Teq is computed and the geochemical trajectory of melt is determined as magma temperature approaches Teq from its starting value, Tm°. The effects of imperfect extraction of anatectic wallrock melt may be accounted for by introduction of an extraction efficiency factor. Mathematical details of a simpler model, EC-AFC (no replenishment) are provided. Energy-constrained models have the advantage of linking thermal and chemical properties of magma chambers. Compared with ‘classical' models that conserve mass and species only, they represent more complete assessments of the complex physicochemical dynamics governing the geochemical evolution of open-system magma bodies. Results of EC-AFC simulations demonstrate that geochemical trends can differ significantly from predictions based on ‘classical' AFC even when recharge plays no role. Incorporation of energy conservation and partial melting into geochemical models allows important coupled effects to play their natural role.},

Some results suggest that the Parana CFB volcanism began at 134.7 +/- 1 Ma and lasted {\textless}1 m.y. Another set of results reveals an extrusion interval of 11 m.y., from ca. 140 Ma to ca. 129 Ma. To resolve this controversy, we reanalyzed three of the exact hand specimens that previously yielded the oldest and youngest ages in the protracted 11 m.y. range. Our new ages are statistically indistinguishable from each other and the previous 134.7 +/- 1 Ma result and indicate a short eruption event. A rapid extrusion for the Parana CFB and the lack of a major cotemporal extinction event challenge proposed direct links between CFB volcanism and mass extinctions and refute petrological models that rely on a protracted extrusion of the Parana CFB.},

abstract = {A mechanism of origin for chromite-rich layers in stratiform ultramafic-gabbroic intrusions is proposed whereby the layers are precipitated on occasions when the basic parental magma of the intrusion is suddenly extensively contaminated with granitic liquid melted from salic roof rocks. It is inferred that the increase of silica and alkalies in the basic liquid should cause it to become more polymerized with a lower frequency of octahedral sites, so that on continued crystallization, Cr3+ is preferentially expelled (into chromite) owing to its large octahedral crystal-field stabilization energy. The feasibility of this process is demonstrated by experimental data on forsterite-picroohromite crystallization relations in the system K2O-MgO-Cr2O3-SiO2, and its apparent applicability to magmas is illustrated through a comparison of the differentiation patterns of Cr and Ni in the Muskox intrusion. The granitic melt is produced because most of the crystals formed in the intrusion accumulate on its floor, leaving the roof rocks to be continuously exposed to the high temperature of the basic magma. Between episodes of contamination, the melt tends to accumulate on top of the basic magma and to remain separate because of its low density and high viscosity. If not assimilated, it eventually resolidifies as granophyre. In the Muskox intrusion there are two chromite-rich layers, each occurring in a stratigraphic unit showing the layer sequence, peridotite-chromitite-orthopyroxenite. This sequence is explained in a model in which the basic magma is contaminated while coprecipitating olivine and minor chromite. A period follows when chromite precipitates alone, and then, because the liquid is enriched in silica, orthopyroxene crystallizes instead of olivine. Variations on the model are described that simulate the main layer sequences involving chromitite in the Stillwater, Great Dyke and Bushveld intrusions. Evidence of contamination is found in the concentrated chromite crystals in the form of small spherical, composite silicate inclusions, rich in alkalies, apparently representing trapped droplets of the contaminant granitic melt in various stages of assimilation. It is suggested that the same type of contamination mechanism may also yield concentrated deposits of magnetite and of immiscible sulphide liquid.},

abstract = {The Bushveld Complex, South Africa, is the world's largest layered intrusion and host to the majority of the known resources of platinum group elements, chromium, and vanadium. Despite intensive study, determining the precise crystallization age of the Bushveld Complex has proven to be difficult. In this study, zircon and rutile were identified in thin section and separated from a sample of pegmatitic feldspathic orthopyroxenite from the PGE-rich Merensky reef, West mine (Townlands shaft), Rustenburg section. Low U (21–105 ppm) zircon occurs with interstitial biotite and is locally in direct contact with sulfide. Rutile occurs mainly as inclusions within or overgrowths on chromite, especially in the chromitite stringers that bound the reef, and also as acicular grains with biotite. A U-Pb crystallization age of 2054.4 ± 1.3 Ma was determined from single-crystal chemical abrasion ID-TIMS U-Pb dating of zircon, and multigrain fractions of rutile yielded a U-Pb cooling age of 2055.0 ± 3.9 Ma. Integration of the Merensky reef crystallization age with existing U-Pb age determinations for intrusions that pre- and postdate emplacement and crystallization of the layered rocks of the Bushveld Complex indicate that magmatism occurred at ca. 2054 Ma and is contemporaneous with related magmatic activity across the northern Kaapvaal craton of South Africa and Botswana.},

abstract = {Chromitites from layered mafic intrusions are of great economic importance, yet the origin of these deposits remains enigmatic. We describe multiphase silicate inclusions trapped within chromite grains from the G chromitite seam of the Stillwater Complex, Montana, United States. These inclusions are interpreted to represent melt trapped during chromite growth and hence provide information on chromitite formation. Most reheated inclusions have variable quench textures and chemical compositions that are consistent with variable degrees of mixing between a high-Mg basaltic parental magma and a Na-rich trondhjemitic melt. The trondhjemite is suggested to derive from partial melting of mafic or metasedimentary country rocks. Based on these inclusions, we outline a model for chromitite formation involving ponding of a new pulse of primitive magma at the roof of the Stillwater magma chamber, followed by localized partial melting and assimilation of the country rock. The newly formed hybrid melts become oversaturated in chromite, leading to extensive chromite crystallization. Chromitite horizons are proposed to form from dense chromite-rich plumes that periodically sink down from the roof zone to settle out as layers at the basal cumulate mush zone. Numerous radiogenic isotope studies, together with the widespread occurrence of similar multiphase inclusions in chromite from other cumulate complexes, indicate that assimilation of country rock by primitive magma may be a critical mechanism for forming chromitites in many layered intrusions.},

abstract = {Since the onset of their eruptive activity within the Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera, about 180 ka ago, Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes have mainly produced lava flow eruptions of basaltic to phonoltic magmas. The products from these eruptions partially fill the caldera, and the adjacent Icod and La Orotava valleys, to the north. Although less frequent, explosive eruptions have also occurred at these composite volcanoes. In order to assess the possible evolution Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes and their potential for future explosive activity, we have analysed their recent volcanic history, assuming that similar episodes have the highest probability of occurrence in the near future. Explosive activity during the last 35000 years has been associated with the eruption of both, mafic (basalts, tephro-phonolites) and felsic (phono-tephrites and phonolites) magmas and has included strombolian, violent strombolian and sub-plinian magmatic eruptions, as well as phreatomagmatic eruptions of mafic magmas. Explosive eruptions have occurred both from central and flank vents, ranging in size from 0.001 to 0.1 km3 for the mafic eruptions and from 0.01 to {\textless} 1 km3 for the phonolitic ones. Comparison of the Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes with the previous cycles of activity from the central complex reveals that all them follow a similar pattern in the petrological evolution but that there is a significant difference in the eruptive behaviour of these different periods of central volcanism on Tenerife. Pre-Teide central activity is mostly characterised by large-volume (1-{\textgreater} 20 km3, DRE) eruptions of phonolitic magmas while Teide-Pico Viejo is dominated by effusive eruptions. These differences can be explained in terms of the different degree of evolution of Teide-Pico Viejo compared to the preceding cycles and, consequently, in the different pre-eruptive conditions of the corresponding phonolitic magmas. A clear interaction between the basaltic and phonolitic systems is observed from the products of phonolitic eruptions, indicating that basaltic magmatism is the driving force of the phonolitic eruptive activity. The magmatic evolution of Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes will continue in the future with a probably tendency to produce a major volume of phonolitic magmas, with an increasing explosive potential. Therefore, the explosive potential of Teide-Pico Viejo cannot be neglected and should be considered in hazard assessment on Tenerife. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The origin of enriched mantle (EM) sources remains an unsolved problem for constraining the composition and chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, because a wealth of different, often mutually exclusive models has been suggested. To address this predicament and to re-investigate the origin of EM sources on a global scale, this study is based on combined chemical and isotopic literature data for more than 530 samples from 16 key locations from worldwide ocean islands. The combined Sr, Nd, Pb isotope and trace element systematics of global ocean island basalts suggest that each EM source contains a unique enriched additive. Systematic variations between Th/Nb, K/La, Rb/La, and Ce/Pb ratios and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in all EM basalts suggest that all EM-type end-members share a common heritage from the continental crust. The observed coupling of relative Eu enrichments or deficits with 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios further indicates that the inferred compositional differences of EM-type sources are caused by the addition of different proportions of lower and upper continental crust. Recycling of marine sediment and oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones accounts for the isotopic and chemical composition of EM sources with high 87Sr/86Sr and relatively constant 206Pb/204Pb ratios (e.g. Samoa), which have a high affinity for the upper continental crust. Sources with a coupled 87Sr/86Sr–206Pb/204Pb isotope evolution that extend to low 206Pb/204Pb but less radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios (e.g. Pitcairn) are dominated by lower continental crust. Transfer of the lower continental crust into the mantle can occur either by subduction erosion or by crustal delamination. Here we propose that one common process, the recycling of upper and lower continental crust and oceanic lithosphere at destructive plate margins and their subsequent re-melting as part of the mantle sources of ocean island basalts, can account for the entire range of chemical and isotopic signatures in EM-type oceanic basalts. This implies that the compositional heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle is induced by, and intrinsic to the recycling process and not principally dependent on intra-mantle stirring of a limited number of originally distinct and physically separate mantle reservoirs.},

abstract = {Volcanic and intrusive rocks with geochemical signatures typical of modern continental or oceanic arcs are uncommon in the Archaean and the archetypal Archaean granite-greenstone dome-and-keel architecture has no modern analogue. Proposed Archaean ophiolites, Atlantic-style passive margins, overprinting thrust and fold belts, blueschists, ultra high-pressure rocks, paired metamorphic belts, orogenic andesites, and subduction-zone m{\'{e}}langes that typify Phanerozoic plate margins are rare to absent. Since there is little evidence for Archaean subduction zones, we consider Archaean arcs to be ‘Snarks', imaginary constructs with no objective existence. Some Archaean folds and upper-mantle structures interpreted as evidence for regional thrusting may equally well have developed during horizontal extension of low-viscosity crust. Nonetheless, there are clearly many Archaean terrains exhibiting fabrics formed by bulk shortening and some cratons contain terranes with contrasting histories. Given the absence of evidence for Archaean subduction, what could be a plausible driving force for compression and terrane accretion? Cratonic mobilism in response to mantle convection currents offers a possible solution to this paradox. Once a proto-craton develops a deep high-viscosity mantle keel, it would become subject to pressure from mantle currents and could drift. Immature cratons or oceanic plateaux would not have a strong mantle keel and so would be static. So, contrary to conventional wisdom, we consider that Archaean cratons are not immobile nucleii along whose margins ‘mobile belts' form by subduction-zone accretion. Instead, we propose that Archaean cratons were the active tectonic agents, accreting and subcreting basaltic plateaux, other proto-cratons, and heterogeneous mantle domains as they drifted. In this model, accreted terranes and structures indicating bulk shortening would be concentrated at the cratonic leading edge, with oblique and strike-slip shear zones at the sides, extension and possible seafloor-spreading in the lee, and major oblique-slip shear zones in the interior developed as a result of the imposed stress field. Overridden oceanic plateaux would be thrust (subcreted) deep enough to melt in the garnet field and generate syntectonic pulses of tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG), contributing to craton growth and stabilization.},

abstract = {We describe an in situ method for simultaneous measurement of U-Pb-Hf isotopes and trace element compositions of zircons using a quadrupole and multiple-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively) connected to a single excimer laser-ablation system. A laser-generated zircon aerosol was split behind the ablation cell into two transport tubes via a Y-shaped connector and simultaneously introduced into the two mass spectrometers. Hafnium isotopes were measured on the MC-ICP-MS instrument, while U-Pb ages and trace element compositions were determined using the Q-ICP-MS. The precision and accuracy of this method was evaluated using six well-known and widely used zircon standards (91500, Temora-2, GJ-1, Mud Tank, BR266 and Monastery). Analyses were carried out using spot sizes of 32, 44 and 60????m. For the 44 and 60????m spot, the resulting U-Pb ages, Hf isotopic and rare earth element (REE) compositions of these six zircons agree with recommended/reported values within 2?? error. The difference in relative standard deviations (RSD) of 206Pb/238U ages between split-flow measurements and those obtained separately on the Q-ICP-MS is within ??? 20{\%} for 91500, Temora-2 and GJ-1, and ??? 60{\%} for Mud Tank (due to its lower U and Pb concentrations). Our method provides a precise approach for determining the U-Pb age and the Hf isotopic and trace element compositions of zircon within a single ablation event. This is in particular important for analysis of zircons that are small or contain complicated zoning patterns. Finally, the REE composition of zircon BR266 is more homogeneous than other zircons and could be a suitable standard by which to benchmark new standards for microprobe analyses of zircons. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Flood basalt provinces may constitute some of the most catastrophic volcanic events in the Earth's history. A popular model to explain them involves adiabatic ascent of plumes of anomalously hot peridotite from a thermal boundary layer deep in the mantle, across the peridotite solidus. However, peridotitic plumes probably require unreasonably high potential temperatures to generate sufficient volumes of magma and high enough melting rates to produce flood volcanism. This lead to the suggestion that low melting eclogitic or pyroxenitic heterogeneities may be present in the source regions of the flood basalts. In order to constrain petrogenetic models for flood basalts generated in this way, an experimental investigation of the melting relations of homogeneous peridotite + oceanic basalt mixtures has been performed. Experiments were conducted at 3.5 GPa on a fertile peridotite (MPY90)–oceanic basalt (GA1) compositional join. The hybrid basalt + peridotite compositions crystallised garnet lherzolite at subsolidus temperatures plus quenched ne -normative picritic liquids at temperatures just above the solidus, over the compositional range MPY90 to GA1 50 MPY90 50 . The solidus temperature decreased slightly from ∼1500 C for MPY90 to ∼1450 C for GA1 50 MPY90 50 . Compositions similar to GA1 30 MPY90 70 have 100{\%} melting compressed into a melting interval which is approximately 50–60{\%} smaller than that for pure MPY90, due to a liquidus minimum. During adiabatic ascent of hybrid source material containing a few tens of percent basalt in peridotite, the lower solidus and compressed solidus–liquidus temperature interval may conspire to substantially enhance melt productivity. Mixtures of recycled oceanic crust and peridotite in mantle plumes may therefore provide a viable source for some flood volcanics. Evidence for this would include higher than normal Fe/Mg values in natural primary liquids, consistent with equilibration with more Fe-rich olivine than normal pyrolitic olivine (i.e. {\textless}Fo 89–92 ). Modelling of fractionation trends in West Greenland picrites is presented to demonstrate that melts parental to the Greenland picrites were in equilibrium at mantle P–T conditions with olivine with Fo 84–86 , suggesting an Fe-enriched source compared with normal peridotite, and consistent with the presence of a basaltic component in the source.},

abstract = {The Laki (Skaft{\'{a}}r Fires) fissure eruption in southern Iceland lasted for eight months during 1783 to 1784, and produced one of the largest basaltic lava flows in historic times (14.7±1.0 km3). In addition, neighboring Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn central volcano was frequently active during the period from May 1783 to May 1785. The combined activity is interpreted as having been the result of a two-year-long volcano-tectonic episode on the Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn volcanic system. Contemporary descriptions of the explosive activity make it possible to relate the tephra stratigraphy to the progress of the eruption on a weekly basis and show that activity on the fissures propagated to the NE with time, towards Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn. The eruption at Laki began on 8 June with a brief explosive event on a short fissure, and lava rapidly began to flow into the Skaft{\'{a}} river gorge. It reached the lowlands, 35 km away, four days later and continued to flow, with variable discharge, until 7 February 1784. Approximately 90{\%} of the lava was emplaced in the first five months of activity. The 27-km-long vent complex is composed of tenen echelon fissures distributed on both sides of the much older Laki hyaloclastite mountain. The surface expression of each fissure is a continuous row of vents consisting of scoria cones, spatter cones, and tuff cones. Six tephra fall units are positively identified; two units are completely compsed of phreatomagmatic tephra derived from two tuff cones and the others are Strombolian deposits. The volume of tephra, including ash fall that extended to mainland Europe, is 0.4 km3 dense rock equivalent volume, or 2.6{\%} of the total erupted volume. Interpretation of contemporary descriptions of tephra falls, combined with the preserved stratigraphy, allow the identification of ten eruptive episodes during the eight months of activity on the Laki fissures. These eruptive episodes are inferred to have resulted from the unsteady flow of magma in the feeder system. In addition, at least eight eruption episodes occurred at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn in 1783 to 1785, five in 1783, two in 1784, and one in 1785. Each episode at Laki began with a seismic swarm of increasing intensity that led to the formation of a new fissure, the opening of which was followed by short-lived phreatomagmatic activity caused by the high water table around the eruption site. Activity usually changed to violent Strombolian or sub-Plinian, followed by Hawaiian fire fountaining and effusive activity as the availability of groundwater dwindled. Thus, the explosive activity associated with the opening of each fissure was largely controlled by external watermagma interactions. Maximum effusion rates, occurring in the first two episodes, are estimated to have been 8.5x103 and 8.7x103 m3 s-1 from fissures totaling 2.2 and 2.8 km in length, respectively, and, in general, discharge gradually decreased over time. The highest rates are equivalent to 5.6x103 and 4.5x103 kg s-1 per meter length of fissure, values that could conceivably be similar to those that produced some flood basalt lava flows. Maximum fire fountain heights are estimated to have varied from 800 m to 1400 m and convecting eruption columns above the vents rose to a maximum altitude of about 15 km. The release of sulfur gases during fountaining produced an acid haze (aerosol) which spread widely and had a considerable environmental, and possibly climatic, impact on the Northern Hemisphere.},

Spheroidal bodies measuring up to 20 cm in diameter occur locally in arfvedsonite lujavrite. They consist of a core rich in analcime and arfvedsonite and a rim rich in analcime, aegirine and a low temperature potassium feldspar. The host lujavrite is dominated by albite and arfvedsonite. The igneous lamination of the host continues undisturbed through rim and core of spheroids and the arfvedsonite crystals in host, rim and core have identical chemical compositions. There are sharp contacts between host and rim and rim and core. Host, rim and core contain the same accessory minerals and have almost identical chemical compositions, the main differences are high H2O and Na2O but low SiO2 in the core and high Fe2O3 in the rim. The spheroids are proposed to have been formed by separation of immiscible interstitial H2O-rich globules of magma from the host lujavrite magma at a late stage in the crystallization of the lujavritic melt.},

abstract = {The consequences of an early epoch of plate tectonics on Mars followed by single-plate tectonics with stagnant lid mantle convection on both crust production and magnetic field generation have been studied with parameterized mantle convection models. Thermal history models with parameterized mantle convection, not being dynamo models, can provide necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for dynamo action. It is difficult to find early plate tectonics models that can reasonably explain crust formation, as is required by geological and geophysical observations, and allow an early magnetic field that is widely accepted as the cause for the observed magnetic anomalies. Dating of crust provinces and topography and gravity data suggest a crust production rate monotonically declining through the Noachian and Hesperian and a present-day crust thickness of more than 50 km. Plate tectonics cools the mantle and core efficiently, and the core may easily generate an early magnetic field. Given a sufficiently weak mantle rheology, plate tectonics can explain a field even if the core is not initially superheated with respect to the mantle. Because the crust production rate is proportional to temperature, however, an early efficient cooling will frustrate later crust production and therefore cannot explain, for example, the absence of prominent magnetic anomalies in the northern crustal province and the northern volcanic plains in the Early Hesperian. Voluminous crust formation following plate tectonics is possible if plate tectonics heat transfer is inefficient but then the crust growth rate has a late peak (about 2 Ga b.p.), which is not observed. These models also require a substantial initial superheating of the core to allow a dynamo. If one accepts the initial superheating, then, as we will show, a simple thermal evolution model with monotonic cooling of the planet due to stagnant lid mantle convection underneath a single plate throughout the evolution can better reconcile early crust formation and magnetic field generation.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous M{\'{e}}gantic intrusive complex of southern Qu{\'{e}}bec contains early noritic gabbrodiorites which represent cumulates from crustally contaminated hawaiite to syenite magmas. Whole rock and mineral chemistry, as well as textural evidence, indicate that post-cumulus recrystallization and reaction were important, and most of the amphibole and biotite are thought to have formed in this way. A younger plutonic quartz-syenite ringdyke may not be cogenetic with the gabbro-diorites sice it lacks orthopyroxene. It may, however, be cogenetic with basaltic to riebeckite granite dykes. Fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, aluminous clinopyroxene, and minor Ti-magnetite from critically undersaturated alkali basaltic magmas generated hawaiitic magmas. The development of quartzbearing mugearitic and syenitic residua from the hawaiites can best be modelled by fractionation of amphibole, plagioclase, olivine, oxides, and apatite. Attempts to model fractionation using observed phenocrysts (including clinopyroxene) were unsuccessful. Amphibole fractionation is interpreted to have taken place through a reaction with still-porous, higher-temperature cumulates on the walls of the magma chamber. The plutonic syenites probably represent alkali feldspar cumulates from the residual syenitic melts. Magnesian calc-alkaline lamprophyres exhibit olivine to phlogopite reaction textures, are enriched in Cr, Ni, K, Rb, Nb, Y, Zr, and Si relative to the basaltic dykes, yet have similar incompatible element ratios. Their relation to the basalts is problematical. The late biotite-granite core to the complex is identical to typical White Mountain granites and may have formed as an anatectic cap on rising, fractionating, mantlederived magmas.},

The Kalkfeld and Ondurakorume complexes contain both Ca- and {\{}Mg/Fe-carbonatites,{\}} composed of calcite alone or calcite with ferroan dolomite, fluorapatite and strontianite. The major element evolution in the bulk rocks from s{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}vites to beforsites is due to crystallization of calcite and fluorapatite. All carbonatites show a negative Y anomaly in normalised {\{}REE{\}} plots. Fractionation is accompanied by successively lower {\{}HREE{\}} contents between Tb and Yb, expressed by the ratios {\{}Nd/Ho{\}} and {\{}Ho/Lu.{\}} The evolution of this downward-facing hump goes along with decreasing Y contents in bulk rocks and minerals. All this requires an additional phase coexisting with the carbonate liquid during fractionation. Comparison between the bulk rocks and the expelled fluid shows that the latter had preferentially accumulated the {\{}HREE{\}} and Y. Further evidence for this process are hydrothermal, {\{}HREE,{\}} Y-rich fluorites in other carbonatite complexes which reflect the composition of the expelled fluid. The high strength of fluoride complexes suggests that fluoride complexing in the carbonatitic fluid is the process responsible for extracting {\{}HREE{\}} and Y from the carbonatite magma, leaving fractionated carbonatite rocks depleted in these elements. The geochemical evolution of carbonatite magmas along fractionation has therefore to be considered in a melt-mineral-fluid system.},

abstract = {The Tamazeght alkaline complex (High Atlas Mountains of Morocco) is a middle Eocene volcanic to plutonic mass, ranging from silica-saturated to silica-undersaturated rocks and carbonatites. Some of the most evolved units are nepheline syenites and pegmatites, which show evidence of hydrothermal alteration. These rocks also contain the highest concentrations of Zr in the complex, although these concentrations are not sufficient to form exploitable reserves. High field strength element (HFSE) minerals (predominantly the zirconosilicates) commonly occur as secondary phases that are richer in Ca and F (cancrinite (Na6Ca(CO3)) (AlSiO4)6•2H2O), calcic catapleiite ((Ca,Na)ZrSi3O9•2H2O), rinkite ((Ca,Ce)4Na(Na,Ca)2Ti(Si2O7)2F2(0,F)2). Furthermore, they partly or completely replace primary HFSE phases (e.g., zircon, eudialyte (Na4(Ca,Ce)2(Fe2+,Mn,Y)ZrSi8O22(OH,Cl)2)). Altered nepheline crystals adjacent to these replaced minerals host fluid inclusions that, based on textural evidence, are interpreted to have formed during alteration. The inclusions have high salinity (25 wt {\%} NaCl equiv), are Ca rich, and were trapped at {\~{}}300°C. They contain several solids in addition to a liquid phase and a vapor bubble. One of the most common daughter minerals is a Ca-La-Ce phase (parisite?). Other daughter or trapped minerals include zircon, a Ti (±Nb) silicate or oxide (rutile?), an Mn hydroxide(?), and less commonly, sphalerite and galena. The occurrence of zircon, parisite, and rutile are evidence for mobilization of Zr and other HFSE during hydrothermal alteration. Based on data available for the solubility of ZrO2 in H2O-HF solutions and estimates for the concentration of Zr in the fluids at the Tamazeght complex (possibly as high as {\~{}}0.05 m), we suggest that HFSE transport occurred by mixed metal OH-F complexing. This transport requires a fluid with an elevated F concentration and a temperature of ±300°C. In addition, it can only take place in the near absence of Ca. We propose that a residual F-rich brine evolving from crystallization of pegmatites at {\textless}500°C leached and transported HFSE. Upon interaction with surrounding limestone, the fluid cooled rapidly and gained Ca. This caused deposition of fluorite (fluorite is very sparingly soluble), which buffered aF to low levels in the fluid causing precipitation of the HFSE in the form of secondary minerals. Because the hydrothermal event was short-lived and relatively restricted in space, HFSE were not concentrated to ore grades.},

abstract = {Phase equilibrium experiments were performed to determine the pre-eruptive conditions of the phonolitic magma responsible for the last eruption (about 1,150 yr B.P.) of Teide volcano. The Lavas Negras phonolite contains 30 to 40 wt{\%} of phenocrysts, mainly anorthoclase, diopside, and magnetite. We have investigated pressures from 100 to 250 MPa, temperatures from 750 to 925°C, water contents from 1.3 to 10 wt{\%}, at an oxygen fugacity (fO2) of 1 log unit above the Ni-NiO solid buffer. Comparison of the natural and experimental phase proportions and compositions indicates that the phonolite was stored at 900 ± 20°C, 150 ± 50 MPa, 3 ± 0.5 wt{\%} dissolved H2O in the melt. The fO2 was probably close to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz solid buffer judging from results of other experimental studies. These conditions constrain the magma storage depth at about 5 ± 1 km below current summit of Teide volcano. Given that the island has not suffered any major structural or topographic changes since the Lavas Negras eruption, any remaining magma from this event should still be stored at such depth and probably with a similar thermal and rheological state.},

abstract = {Inverse theory is used to calculate the melt distribution required to produce the rare earth element concentrations in a wide variety of terrestrial and extra-terrestrial magmas. The concentrations of the major and minor elements in the source regions are assumed to be the same as those for the bulk Earth, and the peridotite mineralogy calculated from the mineral compositions by least squares. Rare earth element partition coefficients are then used for inversion, assuming the melt generation is by fractional melting. The mean composition of the magmas is taken to be an estimate of the average composition of the melt. For n-typc and e-type MORB the results agree well with the adiabatic decompression calculations if the potential temperatures are 1300 and 1500°C respectively. The major and minor element compositions calculated from the melt distribution obtained from the inversion also agree well with those observed. The observations are consistent with a melt fraction that increases monotonically towards the surface, starting at ∼ 80 km and producing ∼ 9 km of melt in the case of n-type MORB, and at ∼ 120 km to produce 23 km in the case of e-type MORB. The inversion calculations show that the melt fractions produced beneath an intact plate by a plume like that beneath Hawaii are smaller, and are also in agreement with the adiabatic calculations if the potential temperature of the plume is ∼ 1500°C. Much of the melt is produced in the depth and temperature range of the transition from garnet to spinel peridotite, in agreement with laboratory experiments and with the full convective models of the Hawaiian plume. The inversion calculations show that the source region for Hawaiian tholeiites changes with time from primitive to depleted mantle. This behaviour is likely to result from percolation, and the processes involved can be understood with the help of a simple analytic model. The last, post-erosional, magmas produced on Oahu come from a source that has been uniformly enriched in all rare earth elements by a factor of about two. Magmas associated with island arcs come from two sources. One resembles that of n-type MORB, and probably is produced by adiabatic upwelling. The other generates calc-alkaline basalt strongly enriched in light rare earth elements, but with a smaller constant enrichment between Gd and Lu. This composition is consistent with the extraction of a melt fraction of 1{\%} from a source containing ∼9{\%} of amphibole. Such a source region can also account for the low values of Ti and Nb, and perhaps also of Ta, observed in island arc magmas. Basaltic andesites and andesites from island arcs show the same amphibole signature, and can be produced from the calc-alkaline basalts by fractional crystallization if amphibole separates with olivine and orthopyroxene. The percolation of a small melt fraction through a mantle wedge that contains considerable amounts of amphibole can only transport very incompatible elements, such as He, U, Th, and Rb, towards the Earth's surface. Sr and Nd are likely to be too compatible to move against the matrix flow, but Pb may do so locally. These results have important implications for the isotopic systematics of the upper mantle. The melt distributions obtained from ophiolites are like those for island arc tholeiites, though a potential temperature of 1400 °C fits the results better than does one of 1300°C. Archaean tholeiites and basaltic komatiites give melt distributions similar to that of e-type MORB from Iceland, and can be produced by adiabatic decompression if the mantle potential temperature is 1500cC, with tholeiites having lost more material by fractional crystallization. The melt distribution obtained from komatiites requires the melt fraction to reach ∼60{\%} at the surface. Though the calculated compositions agree with those observed, decompression is unable to generate such large melt fractions. Inversion shows that plateau basalts can be produced from the upper mantle beneath the plates by adiabatic upwelling beneath a mechanical boundary layer 60 km thick. Many of the varied alkali-rich continental magmas are generated by melting an enriched source in the stability field of garnet peridotite. The average enrichment required, by a factor of between two and five, can be produced by the addition of a small melt fraction. Carbonatites show no evidence of amphibole involvement at any stage, a result that is consistent with their formation by liquid immiscibility. Inversion of the rare earth element concentrations in shales gives a melt distribution similar to that from calc-alkaline basalts from island arcs, with a strong amphibole signature. Generation of the continental crust by separation of calc-alkaline magma from 40{\%} of the mantle can account for the difference between primitive and depleted mantle. Low-K highland basalts from the Moon can be produced directly from the average primitive lunar mantle if the melt fraction involved is °0-5{\%}, and if they were generated in the stability field of plagioclase and spinel peridotite. Intermediate-K highland basalts come from a source that has been enriched by a factor of about two, and show no evidence of amphibole involvement. The rare earth concentrations in mare basalts require melt fractions of up to 7{\%} in the spinel peridotite stability field, and can be generated by adiabatic upwelling of mantle whose potential temperature is 1300°C beneath a mechanical boundary layer that is 150 km thick. Because lunar gravity is only one-sixth of that of the Earth, the thickness of the melting zone and the volume of melt produced are six times greater for the Moon than for the Earth for the same value of Tp. Both low-Ti and high-Ti mare basalts may have lost as much as 70 and 85{\%} respectively of their original material through crystal fractionation. It is, however, difficult to understand how such an origin can account for the high magnesium concentrations. Basaltic achondrites involve melt fractions of 10-15{\%}, generated in the spinel or plagioclase stability field.},

abstract = {We have experimentally determined the partition coefficients of rare earth elements (REE), HFSE (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) and other trace elements between clinopyroxene and potassic silicate melts at 0.1–200 MPa and 1042–1140°C. The major and trace element contents of clinopyroxene and liquid were determined by electron probe and ion microprobe, respectively. The liquidus clinopyroxenes are extremely rich in Al2O3 (up to 12{\%}) and Fe2O3, which enables us to test suggestions that partition coefficients of HFSE and REE depend on the Al content of the clinopyroxene (e.g., Lundstrom, C.C., Shaw, H.F., Ryerson, F.J., Williams, Q., Gill, J., 1998. Crystal chemical control of clinopyroxene–melt partitioning in the Di–Ab–An system: implications for elemental fractionations in the depleted mantle. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 62, 2849–2862.). When compared with previous data for low-alumina clinopyroxene crystallised under similar P–T conditions, the increase in weight partition coefficient Di (=[I]xtl/[I]liq) for all the HFSE and REE is dramatic. For Ti and the REE, partition coefficients increase by about one order of magnitude as Aliv concentration of clinopyroxene increases from 0.02 to 0.5. For Nb, Ta and Zr, the effect is even more pronounced, a two order of magnitude increase being found to correspond to this increase in Aliv. We applied the data to model the fractionation of historic lavas from Vesuvius. Previous work using the major elements (Belkin, H.E., Kilburn, C.R.J., DeVivo, B., 1993. Sampling and major element chemistry of the recent (AD 1631–1944) Vesuvius activity. J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 58, 273–290.) indicates a liquid line of descent from trachybasalt to leucite tephrite dominated by clinopyroxene crystallisation. The REE and HFSE concentrations in the lavas are consistent with 40–50{\%} fractional crystallisation of clinopyroxene (accompanied by minor leucite) between the two magmatic endmembers, with partition coefficients for the REE appropriate for clinopyroxenes containing ≤7.5 wt.{\%} Al2O3. Pyroxenes of the latter composition are frequent phenocrysts in the lavas and previous experimental work (Dolfi, D., Trigila, R., 1988. Chemical relations between clinopyroxenes and coexisting glasses obtained from melting experiments on alkaline basic lavas. Rend. Soc. Ital. Mineral. Petrol. 43, 1101–1110; Trigila, R., De Benedetti, A.A., 1993. Petrogenesis of Vesuvius historical lavas constrained by Pearce element ratio analysis and experimental phase equilibria. J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 58, 315–343.) implies that they precipitate under very low pressure low water activity conditions, i.e. within the magma chamber at {\textless}200 MPa.},

abstract = {The 1{\textperiodcentered}13 Ga Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusive complex, South Greenland, is composed of various types of alkali granite and silica-undersaturated alkaline to agpaitic nepheline syenites related to three subsequently intruded magma batches. Mineral chemistry indicates continuous fractionation trends within each rock type, but with distinct differences among them. The last, peralkaline magma batch is the most fractionated in terms of XFemafic mineral, feldspar composition and mineral assemblage. This indicates that an evolving magma chamber at depth discontinuously released more highly fractionated alkaline melts. Fluid inclusions in some sodalites record a pressure drop from 3{\textperiodcentered}5 to 1 kbar indicating that crystallization started during magma ascent and continued in the high-level magma chamber. On the basis of phase equilibria and preliminary fluid inclusion data, crystallization temperature drops from {\textgreater}1000°C (augite syenite liquidus) to {\textless}500°C (lujavrite solidus) and silica activity decreases from ∼0{\textperiodcentered}8 to {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}3. An almost pure methane fluid phase at high temperatures and an almost pure aqueous fluid phase in the last crystallization stages of the agpaitic rocks indicate a strong increase in water activity. NaCl activity drops from 0{\textperiodcentered}4 during magmatic sodalite crystallization to {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01 (3 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) in the late magmatic aqueous fluids. Relative oxygen fugacity [$\Delta$FMQ, where FMQ is fayalite–magnetite–quartz)] depends on silica and water activity via two solid–solid buffer reactions. It decreases during fractionation in the augite syenite from about FMQ – 1 to below FMQ – 4, but increases in the peralkaline stage. The extreme peralkaline fractionation trend appears to be governed by low water activity and low SiO2 activity in the parental melt. Only then is methane a stable fluid phase during most of the crystallization history, which prevents early unmixing of an aqueous NaCl-bearing fluid phase.},

Using a sample spacing of 5m or less, we demonstrate that the uppermost unit of the Upper Critical Zone (an anorthosite with large intercumulus pyroxene mottles, designated unit HW5 at Impala Platinum Mines), whilst petrographically part of the Giant Mottled Anorthosite, has some chemical attributes that link it to the Main Zone. We attribute the hybrid geochemical signature of unit HW5 to partial melting of the anorthosite, due to an influx of Main Zone magma above it, followed by hybridization of the remelted intercumulus material with evolved intercumulus liquids from the overlying Main Zone.},

abstract = {Mantle xenoliths hosted by the historic Volcan de San Antonio, La Palma, Canary Islands include veined spinel harzburgites and spinel dunites. Glasses and associated minerals in the vein system of veined xenoliths show a gradual transition in composition from broad veins to narrow veinlets. Broad veins contain alkali basaltic glass with semi-linear trace element patterns enriched in strongly incompatible elements. As the veins become narrower, the SiO2-contents in glass increase (46 → 67 wt{\%} SiO2 in harzburgite, 43 → 58 wt{\%} in dunite) and the trace element patterns change gradually to concave patterns depleted in moderately incompatible elements (e.g. HREE, Zr, Ti) relative to highly incompatible ones. The highest SiO2-contents (ca. 68{\%} SiO2, low Ti-Fe-Mg-Ca-contents) and most extreme concave trace element patterns are exhibited by glass in unveined peridotite xenoliths. Clinopyroxenes shift from LREE-enriched augites in basaltic glass, to REE-depleted Cr-diopside in highly silicic glass. Estimates indicate that the most silicic glasses represent melts in, or near, equilibrium with their host peridotites. The observed trace element changes are compatible with formation of the silicic melts by processes involving infiltration of basaltic melts into mantle peridotite followed by reactions and crystallization. The Fe-Mg interdiffusion profiles in olivine porphyroclasts adjacent to the veins indicate a minimum period of diffusion of 600 years, implying that the reaction processes have taken place in situ in the upper mantle. The CaO-TiO2-La/Nd relationships of mantle rocks may be used to discriminate between metasomatism caused by carbonatitic and silicic melts. Unveined mantle xenoliths from La Palma and Hierro (Canary Islands) show a wide range in La/Nd ratios with relatively constant, low-CaO contents which is compatible with metasomatism of “normal” abyssal peridotite by silicic melts. Peridotite xenoliths from Tenerife show somewhat higher CaO and TiO2 contents than those from the other islands and may have been affected by basaltic or carbonatitic melts. The observed trace element signatures of ultramafic xenoliths from La Palma and other Canary Islands may be accounted for by addition of small amounts (1–7{\%}) of highly silicic melt to unmetasomatized peridotite. Also ultramafic xenoliths from other localities, e.g. eastern Australia, show CaO-TiO2-La/Nd relationships compatible with metasomatism by silicic melts. These results suggest that silicic melts may represent important metasomatic agents.},

abstract = {The petrology, geochemistry and petrogenesis of the active Teide-Pico Viejo volcanic complete provide information about the evolution and internal structure of the Tenerife central magma system during its mast recent volcanic cycle. Two petrologically distinct basanite-phonolite lineages are identified, which correlate essentially with the products of the Pico Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes. Geochemical modelling supports the evolution of bath series from a common evolved basanite parent, by crystal fractionation under different physico-chemical conditions. Pico Viejo series intermediate magmas fractionated mainly kaersutite and low-Or plagioclase at high P-H2O, whereas Teide series examples fractionated mainly high-Or plagioclase and clinopyroxene at low P-H2O, resulting in lower Ba, Sr Eu/Eu* and MREE/HREE, and less peralkaline phonolitic residua. The Pico Viejo series shows smooth nodal, mineralogical and whole-rock chemical variations, Whereas the Teide series shows the additional effects of mineral accumulation, magma mixing, assimilation of hydrothermally altered crust and contamination by felsic magmas. Pyroxene barometry suggests that parental basanites and Pico Viejo series intermediate magmas evolved in the lower crust and uppermost mantle at 6-12 kbar P-total. Teide series intermediate map-mas experienced polybaric fractionation, also differentiating extensively within a shallow chamber beneath Teide, where low P-H2O conditions resulted from low P-total and, on the basis off and CI systematics, from open-system degassing. Hygrometry and melt-inclusion data from phonolites suggest a shallow Teide chamber at similar to 1.5 kbar P-total, whereas Pico Viejo series phonolites evolved in a separate shallow chamber at similar to 1 kbar P-total.},

abstract = {Basaltic lavas erupted at some oceanic intraplate hotspot volcanoes are thought to sample ancient subducted crustal materials. However, the residence time of these subducted materials in the mantle is uncertain and model-dependent, and compelling evidence for their return to the surface in regions of mantle upwelling beneath hotspots is lacking. Here we report anomalous sulphur isotope signatures indicating mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in olivine-hosted sulphides from 20-million-year-old ocean island basalts from Mangaia, Cook Islands (Polynesia), which have been suggested to sample recycled oceanic crust. Terrestrial MIF sulphur isotope signatures (in which the amount of fractionation does not scale in proportion with the difference in the masses of the isotopes) were generated exclusively through atmospheric photochemical reactions until about 2.45 billion years ago. Therefore, the discovery of MIF sulphur in these young plume lavas suggests that sulphur--probably derived from hydrothermally altered oceanic crust--was subducted into the mantle before 2.45 billion years ago and recycled into the mantle source of Mangaia lavas. These new data provide evidence for ancient materials, with negative $\Delta$(33)S values, in the mantle source for Mangaia lavas. Our data also complement evidence for recycling of the sulphur content of ancient sedimentary materials to the subcontinental lithospheric mantle that has been identified in diamond-hosted sulphide inclusions. This Archaean age for recycled oceanic crust also provides key constraints on the length of time that subducted crustal material can survive in the mantle, and on the timescales of mantle convection from subduction to upwelling beneath hotspots.},

The average Er-O bond separation was found to vary only slightly between 2.24 and 2.21 {\AA} and the Yb-O bond between 2.20 and 2.18 {\AA}. The first-shell coordination number decreased as the rare-earth oxide replaced Al2O3. For Er2O3-doped samples this decrease was about 28{\%}, from 6.5 to 4.7 atoms, whereas for Yb2O3-doped ones it was about 14{\%}, from 6.4 to 5.5 atoms. The decrease in the coordination number is attributed to the difficulty of rare-earth atoms to coordinate a larger number of the nonbridging oxygens that appear as the CaO/Al2O3 ratio decreases. The Debye-Waller factor 2$\sigma$2 varied from 0.026 to 0.012 {\AA}2.},

abstract = {The intrusion of voluminous Late Archean plutonic rocks is the final event leading to the stabilization of the Slave craton. Three groups of plutonic rocks are recognized in the central part of the province: Group 1 (∼2689–2650 Ma) includes high-Al2O3 (Olga Suite) and low-Al2O3 (Gondor and Wishbone Suites) trondhjemites and diorite (Central Belt Suite) all of which are temporally or spatially associated with volcanic rocks; Group 2 (∼2610–600 Ma) includes syn- to late deformation hornblende-biotite monzodiorite through granodiorite (Concession Suite) and trondhjemites (Siege Suite); and Group 3 (∼2599–2580 Ma) consists of post-deformational muscovite-biotite granites (Contwoyto Suite) and biotite granites (Yamba Suite).

Volcanic and associated mafic plutonic rocks are calc-alkaline and have trace element characteristics diagnostic of rocks formed in modern subduction zone settings. The high-A1203 and low-A1203 trondhjemite suites may be derived by high and low pressure partial melting of mafic crust, respectively. Rocks of the Concession Suite are calc-alkaline, metaluminous and have high contents of Sr, Ba and LREE, high (Ce/Yb)Nratios and negative Nb anomalies. Parental magmas are derived from melting enriched mantle sources and related rocks were produced through assimilation-fractional crystallization and mixing processes in the crust. The younger granites are derived from mixing and homogenization of mantle- and crust-derived materials (Yamba Suite) and the partial melting of metasedimentary protoliths (Contwoyto Suite).

Volcanic and Group 1 rocks are interpreted to be remnants of an allochthonous island arc terrane which was accreted to a continental block. The secular evolution in the composition of Group 2 and 3 plutonic rocks reflects a change from dominantly mantle- to crustal-derived magmatism during and following collision. Thickening of the lithosphere during collision, followed by lithospheric detachment caused melting of previously subduction-modified mantle beneath the accreted island arc terranes and generation of magmas parental to the Concession Suite. Intrusion of mantle-derived magmas, in combination with crustal thickening resulted in high T, low P metamorphism, crustal melting and the generation of the two Group 3 plutonic suites.},

abstract = {The Gross Spitzkoppe is a small (similar to30 km(2)) anorogenic granite stock that was emplaced into the Damara Orogenic Belt of central western Namibia in response to mantle plume activity and early Cretaceous rifting of western Gondwanaland. The epizonal Gross Spitzkoppe stock (GSS), penecontemporaneous mafic and felsic dikes in the country rocks, and synplutonic mafic dikes and mafic magmatic inclusions within the GSS indicate bimodal magmatism. The GSS consists of three zonally arranged granitic units: medium-grained biotite granite at the margins, coarse-grained biotite granite, and porphyritic granite at the center of the stock. Late-stage silicic dikes and pegmatites cut the granites of the stock. All the granites are mildly peraluminous, topaz-bearing, high-silica monzogranites that contain extremely Fe-rich biotite (siderophyllite-annite) as the only primary mafic silicate. Common accessory minerals include: topaz, fluorite, magnetite, zircon, monazite, thorite, ilmenite, columbite, and niobian rutile. Miarolitic cavities and pegmatite pockets within the stock Suggest that fluid saturation was attained. Rectilinear structures of biotite-rich schlieren along the marginal parts of the stock Suggest that magma flow was parallel to the walls of the chamber, whereas turbulent or plume-like flows are indicated by Curved, circular, and ladder-dike schlieren. Geochemical variation among the granites can be attributed to fractional crystallization of major and accessory minerals and by accumulation of halogen complexes with rare-earth and high-field-strength elements. The negative, partially irregular, correlation between whole-rock contents of F and Cl suggests that Cl was partially lost to a vapor phase during magmatic degassing. The granites of the Gross Spitzkoppe show clear A-type and within-plate granite characteristics, corresponding to the actual tectonic setting. The granites are interpreted to have formed by partial crustal remelting related to mafic underplating in a continental rift environment.},

abstract = {Security of supply of a number of raw materials is of concern for the European Union; foremost among these are the rare earth elements (REE), which are used in a range of modern technologies. A number of research projects, including the EURARE and ASTER projects, have been funded in Europe to investigate various steps along the REE supply chain. This paper addresses the initial part of that supply chain, namely the potential geological resources of the REE in Europe. Although the REE are not currently mined in Europe, potential resources are known to be widespread, and many are being explored. The most important European resources are associated with alkaline igneous rocks and carbonatites, although REE deposits are also known from a range of other settings. Within Europe, a number of REE metallogenetic belts can be identified on the basis of age, tectonic setting, lithological association and known REE enrichments. This paper reviews those metallogenetic belts and sets them in their geodynamic context. The most well-known of the REE belts are of Precambrian to Palaeozoic age and occur in Greenland and the Fennoscandian Shield. Of particular importance for their REE potential are the Gardar Province of SW Greenland, the Svecofennian Belt and subsequent Mesoproterozoic rifts in Sweden, and the carbonatites of the Central Iapetus Magmatic Province. However, several zones with significant potential for REE deposits are also identified in central, southern and eastern Europe, including examples in the Bohemian Massif, the Iberian Massif, and the Carpathians.},

abstract = {The water solubility in various phonolite melts was determined experimentally at pressures between 50 and 395 MPa and at temperatures between 850 and 1200 °C. The aim of this study was to elucidate to which extent chemical and physical parameters such as relative amounts of alkali and alkaline earth elements or temperature affect the water solubility. For this purpose a total of 10 different phonolite glasses were prepared. For a series of four glasses, the Na/(Na + K) ratio was varied from 0.2 to 0.8, for another series of four glasses, the (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) ratio was varied from 2.8 to 10.1, while keeping Na/(Na + K) constant at 0.4. For these two series water solubility experiments were performed at 1200 °C and pressures between 50 and 395 MPa in an internally heated pressure vessel. The data show that both chemical variables have rather small effects on the water solubility. For instance, at 2 kbar and 1200 °C an increase in Na/(Na + K) ratio from 0.2 to 0.8 leads to an increase in water solubility of about 0.4 wt.{\%} (5.58 to 5.94 wt.{\%}), while increasing the (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) ratio from 2.8 to 10.1 leads to an increase of about 0.2 wt.{\%} water. The effect of temperature was investigated for two phonolite compositions, representative of Monta{\~{n}}a Blanca, Tenerife, Spain and the Laacher See volcanic complex, East Eifel, Germany at pressures of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 MPa, and temperatures between 850 and 1200 °C. At these conditions both melts exhibit negative temperature dependence ranging from about - 0.1 to - 0.24 wt.{\%} water per 100 °C. The strongest temperature dependence (most negative values) occurs at 150 to 200 MPa and seems to approach zero slightly above 300 MPa. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The latter three types of complexes may be linked to the aluminosilicate network via Al-O-Si bridges.

abstract = {Carbonatites are familiar to students of petrology as rare igneous rocks formed predominantly of carbonate, whose only modern expression is a single active volcano that erupts strongly alkaline carbonate lavas with no direct match in Earth's geological record (see Lengai movie in the electronic version of this chapter or on the MSA RiMG website). Based on their Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data, stable isotopic compositions, noble gases, and experimental phase equilibria, they are derived from the mantle, showing almost no sign of contamination by the crust.  As liquids, carbonate melts have remarkable physical properties, which set them apart from the alkaline silicate melts with which they are often temporally associated. They show very high solubilities of many elements considered rare in silicate magmas, and they have the highest known melt capacities for dissolving water and other volatile species like halogens at crustal pressures. They are highly efficient transport agents of carbon from the mantle to the crust, remaining mobile over extraordinary ranges of temperature, and their very low viscosity should enhance connectivity along grain boundaries in the mantle where they are implicated in geochemical enrichment processes related to metasomatism.  Most carbonatites have unambiguous origins in the mantle and the limit to their depth is not known, but the likelihood that they may exist in the lower mantle (Kaminsky et al. 2009, 2012; Stoppa et al. 2009) needs to be appraised since they may exert a fundamental control on the mobility and long-term storage of deep carbon in Earth. Ultimately the stability of carbonate melt is an extension of the stability of carbonate minerals (Hazen et al. 2013a,b) subject critically to the mantle oxidation state (Luth 1993; Frost and McCammon 2008); carbonate-melts have also been predicted in the oceanic low-velocity zone and deep mantle (Hauri et al. 1993 {\ldots} },

The Mountain Pass carbonatite and alkaline rocks lie in a narrow belt of occurrences of alkaline rocks 130 km long. Both the carbonatite and the associated alkaline rocks are chemically and mineralogically unusual. The mafic members of the Mountain Pass alkaline rock suite belong to the ultrapotassic group, and are most akin to the lamproite subdivision of that group. These rocks are part of a unique ultrapotassic suite in that it ranges from typical mafic lithologies to silicic granite. The association with significant amounts of carbonatite is also unique. Chemical similarities suggest that the carbonatite, which has yielded slightly younger (1.38 Ga) ages, is related to the ultrapotassic rocks. It is not clear if the carbonatite and associated alkaline rocks came from a common magmatic parent, but they likely came from a common enriched source in the mantle.},

abstract = {We report major and trace element abundances for 147 samples and Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb isotope compositions for a 36 sample subset of basaltic lava flows, sills, and dykes from the Karoo continental flood basalt (CFB) province in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and northern South Africa. Both low- and high-Ti (TiO2 {\textless} 2wt {\%} and {\textgreater} 2wt {\%}) rocks are included. MELTS modeling shows that these magmas evolved at low pressure (1kbar) through fractional crystallization of gabbroic assemblages. Whereas both groups display enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) relative to heavy REE (HREE) and high field strength elements, and systematic negative Nb anomalies, they differ in terms of contrasting middle REE (MREE) to HREE fractionation, which is greater for the high-Ti basalts. This reflects different depths of melting of slightly enriched mantle sources: calculations suggest that the low-Ti basalts were generated by melting of a shallow spinel-bearing (2 {\%} spinel) lherzolite, whereas the high-Ti magmas originated from a deeper-seated garnet-bearing (2-7{\%} garnet) lherzolite. In most isotope plots, the high-Ti lavas together with the picrites define a common trend from Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) to compositions with strongly negative $\epsilon$Ndi and $\epsilon$Hfi akin to those of some nephelinites and lamproites. The low-Ti rocks are shifted from BSE-like to more radiogenic Sr isotope ratios, indicative of upper crustal contamination. Trace element and isotope characteristics of the Karoo magmas require a combination of enrichment processes (subduction induced?) and long-term isolation of the mantle sources. We propose two distinct scenarios to explain the origin of the Karoo province. The first calls for polybaric melting of spatially heterogeneous, partially veined, sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Calculations show that mixing between SCLM (∼BSE) and a strongly Nd-Hf unradiogenic nephelinite-like component (sediment input?) could account for the compositional variations of most of the high-Ti group lavas, whereas the mantle composition responsible for the low-Ti magmas is more likely to be similar to a vein-free, metasomatically enriched SCLM component. The second scenario involves mixing between two end-members represented by the SCLM and its deep-seated alkalic veins and a sub-lithospheric (asthenospheric- or ocean island basalt-like?) mantle plume. In this case, the data are compatible with an increasing mantle plume contribution as the plume rises and expands through the lithosphere. Regardless of which of the two scenarios is invoked, the spatial distribution of the low- and high-Ti magmas matches the relative positioning of the cratons and the Limpopo belt in such a way that strong control of the lithosphere on magma composition and distribution is a mandatory requirement of any petrogenetic model applied to the Karoo CFB. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {The analysis of Siberian basement geology, Meso- to Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions and magmatism together with recent palaeomagnetic and geochronological data suggest that Siberia could be a promontory of Rodinia. Most of Siberia's margins faced an open ocean in the Meso- and Neoproterozoic. Passive margin sedimentary successions accumulated along the eastern, western, and possibly northern edges of the Siberian craton. The western Siberian passive margin evolved into an active margin in the early Neoproterozoic. The passive margin succession developed along the south-western edge of Siberia in the mid-Neoproterozoic, probably reflecting the drift of Siberia from Rodinia. An apparent absence of the traces of Mackenzie, Franklin, and Gunbarrel igneous events and of the Grenville-age orogeny in Siberia argues against a tight connection between Siberia and Laurentia. Palaeomagnetically permissive reconstructions require some “buffer” continent between Siberia and Laurentia in Rodinian times. This continent could include some Precambrian fragments of Arctic parts of Eurasia and North America.},

Sabadini (Editors), Relationships between Mantle Processes and Geological Processes at or near the Earth's Surface. Tectonophysics, 223: 39–52.

Most continental flood basalts are enriched in incompatible elements and have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios and low ϵNd values. Many are depleted in Nb and Ta. The commonly-held view that these characteristics are inherited directly from a source in metasomatized lithospheric mantle is inconsistent with the following arguments: (1) thermomechanical modelling demonstrates that flood basalt magmas come mainly from an asthenospheric or plume source, with minimal direct melting of the continental lithospheric mantle. The low water contents of most flood basalts argue against proposals that hydrous lithosphere was the source. (2) Lithospheric mantle normally has low concentrations of incompatible elements, and chondrite-normalized Nb and Ta contents similar to those of other incompatible elements. Such material cannot be the unmodified source of Nb-Ta-depleted basalts such as those from the Karoo, Ferrar, or Columbia River provinces.

We suggest there are two main controls on the compositions of continental flood basalts. The first is lithospheric thickness, which strongly influences the depth and degree of mantle melting of a plume or asthenospheric source, and thus has an important influence on the composition of primary magmas. All liquids formed by partial melting of peridotite at sub-lithosphere depths are highly magnesian (20–25 wt.{\%} MgO) but have variable trace-element contents. Where the lithosphere is thick, the source melts at high pressure, garnet is present, the degree of melting is low, and trace-element concentrations are high. This type of magma evolves to produce the high-Ti type of continental flood basalt. Where the lithosphere is thinner, the source ascends to shallower levels, the degree of melting is greater, garnet may be exhausted, and the magmas have lower trace-element contents; these magmas yield low-Ti basalts.

The second control is processing of magmas in chambers that were periodically replenished and tapped, while continuously fractionating and assimilating their wall rocks. The uniform compositions of basalts that evolve in such chambers are far removed from those of their picritic parental magmas. Major elements in continental flood basalts reflect control by olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase crystallization, and this assemblage places the magma chambers at crustal depth. We believe that trace-element and isotopic compositions are also buffered, and that the erupted basalts represent steady-state liquids tapped from these magma chambers. These processes impose a crustal signature on the magmas, as expressed most strongly in the concentrations of incompatible elements (e.g., Nb-Ta anomalies) and their isotopic characteristics.},

abstract = {The Monteregian Hills and younger White Mountain alkaline intrusions were emplaced into the Cambro-Ordovician sediments of the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the folded and thrusted Lower Paleozoic sequence of the Appalachian orogen. Age relations indicate that there is a fine-scale structure to the igneous activity, with slightly undersaturated to critically saturated rocks emplaced between 141 and 128 Ma and strongly undersaturated rocks emplaced between 121 and 117 Ma. Sr and Pb isotopic data for the mantle-derived alkali picrite, alkali olivine basalt and basanite magmas, indicate derivation from a depleted mantle similar to that which produces present-day oceanic island basalts. For the most isotopically primitive samples, decay-corrected87Sr86Sr = 0.7030-0.7037,206Pb204Pb = 19.05-19.72,207Pb204Pb = 15.56-15.65, and208Pb204Pb = 38.64-39.26. On Pb-Sr isotope correlation diagrams the data define trends similar to those for MOR basalts, implying mantle heterogeneity which requires the presence of a component enriched in radiogenic Pb relative to Sr. The interaction of these isotopically primitive magmas with the crust can be defined in terms of a three component system: depleted mantle-Grenville age crust-Lower Paleozoic age crust. The granitic magmas were apparently derived from the Lower Paleozoic crust of the Appalachian orogen. For the mantle-derived magmas, Th/U ratios vary from 2.5 (estimated ratio for MORB source) to 5.1, with the mean value near that of the bulk earth. The variations in Th/U suggest mantle heterogeneity on a local scale, and the high Th/U of some samples suggests that the mantle was enriched in incompatible elements shortly before melting. The magmas derived by partial melting of the crust have Th/U of 3.3 to 8.7, and the higher ratios are associated with rocks crystallized from magmas that originated by melting of Lower Paleozoic sediments. The Sr and Pb isotopic data support the conclusion of Bell et al. (1982) that the subcontinental mantle under eastern Canada underwent a Precambrian depletion event. This depleted mantle apparently extends under the White Mountain province and is isotopically similar to the mantle which gives rise to oceanic island basalts. In contrast, Pb isotopic ratios for the New England Seamount chain (TARAS and HART, 1983), which apparently represents the oceanic extension of this magmatic activity, are significantly more radiogenic. It is possible that a mantle plume provided the heat energy, and perhaps metasomatic fluids, to trigger melting in the subcontinental mantle, whereas in the case of the oceanic extension the plume directly contributed to the observed magmatism, as reflected in the more radiogenic Pb ratios. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {We present the results of the first systematic study of melt compositions at Pantelleria, based on both melt inclusions and matrix glasses in pantellerites from 10 eruptions during the last eruptive cycle ({\textless}45 kyr). We present major and trace element compositions, as well as data on the volatiles sulphur (S), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and lithium (Li) Rare earth element (REE) compositions were inverted using the program INVMEL to establish the melt fraction vs depth relationship in the Pantellerian mantle source region. Inversion indicates that melts are generated by ∼1{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} melting of a light rare earth element (LREE)-enriched mantle source. The source lies principally within the spinel–garnet transition zone, which, on the basis of trace element ratios, shows some affinity to the source of North African magmatism. Major and trace element data indicate a gap in melt compositions at intermediate compositions, consistent with previously published whole-rock data. This gap rules out the possibility of explaining chemical variability in the Pantelleria lavas merely by changes in the crystal content of the magmas. Principal component analysis of major element glass compositions shows that the liquid line of descent for mafic melt compositions is controlled by clinopyroxene, plagioclase, magnetite and olivine crystallization. Alkali feldspar, clinopyroxene, ilmenite and olivine or aenigmatite crystallization controls the liquid line of descent for the silicic melt compositions, with aenigmatite broadly replacing olivine in the most evolved magmas. Trace element modelling indicates that 96{\%} fractional crystallization is required to generate pantellerites from alkali basalts at Pantelleria (through trachytes, generated after 76{\%} fractional crystallization). We have measured pantellerite volatile concentrations in melt inclusions and in matrix glasses from a variety of eruptions. Melt inclusions, on average, contain 350 ppm S, 3500 ppm F and 9000 ppm Cl. We have measured up to 4{\textperiodcentered}9 wt {\%} H2O and 150 ppm CO2 in melt inclusions. Li–H2O systematics and Cl abundances in melt inclusions are consistent with partitioning of Li and Cl into a subcritical hydrosaline fluid at low pressures. The volatiles H2O and CO2 are used to estimate melt equilibration pressures, which reach a maximum of 1{\textperiodcentered}5 kbar. Temperatures of 800°C are calculated for the most evolved pantellerites, using published feldspar–melt geothermometers, and up to 870°C for the least evolved samples. Low melt viscosities are calculated for the range of pantellerite compositions observed and may account for rapid differentiation by crystal settling. Stable density stratification of the magma chamber is reflected in the eruption of generally progressively more fractionated compositions after the Green Tuff eruption during the last eruptive cycle. Some anomalies in this trend may be explained by variation in the relative rates of eruption vs fractionation. The density stratification is expected to be enhanced and further stabilized by the efficient migration of a fluid phase to the roof of the magma chamber. The sulphur data are used in combination with published experimental partitioning data for peralkaline rhyolites to estimate the sulphur yield to the atmosphere for a large pantelleritic eruption similar to the Green Tuff. This is expected to be markedly higher than for a similar-sized metaluminous rhyolitic or dacitic eruption, mainly owing to the higher bulk sulphur content, lower fluid–melt partition coefficients, and rapid differentiation and vapour phase segregation in the magma chamber.},

abstract = {The solubility of silver sulphide (acanthite/argentite) has been measured in aqueous sulphide solutions between 25 and 400°C at saturated water vapour pressure and 500 bar to determine the stability and stoichiometry of sulphide complexes of silver(I) in hydrothermal solutions. The experiments were carried out in a flow-through autoclave, connected to a high-performance liquid chromatographic pump, titanium sampling loop, and a back-pressure regulator on line. Samples for silver determination were collected via the titanium sampling loop at experimental temperatures and pressures. The solubilities, measured as total dissolved silver, were in the range 1.0 × 10−7 to 1.30 × 10−4 mol kg−1 (0.01 to 14.0 ppm), in solutions of total reduced sulphur between 0.007 and 0.176 mol kg−1 and pHT,p of 3.7 to 12.7. A nonlinear least squares treatment of the data demonstrates that the solubility of silver sulphide in aqueous sulphide solutions of acidic to alkaline pH is accurately described by the reactions0.5Ag2S(s) + 0.5H2S(aq) = AgHS(aq) Ks,1110.5Ag2S(s) + 0.5H2S(aq) + HS− = Ag(HS)2− Ks,122Ag2S(s) + 2HS− = Ag2S(HS)22− Ks,232where AgHS(aq) is the dominant species in acidic solutions, Ag(HS)2− under neutral pH conditions and Ag2S(HS)22− in alkaline solutions. With increasing temperature the stability field of Ag(HS)2− increases and shifts to more alkaline pH in accordance with the change in the first ionisation constant of H2S(aq). Consequently, Ag2S(HS)22− is not an important species above 200°C. The solubility constant for the first reaction is independent of temperature to 300°C, with values in the range logKs,111 = −5.79 (±0.07) to −5.59 (±0.09), and decreases to −5.92 (±0.16) at 400°C. The solubility constant for the second reaction increases almost linearly with inverse temperature from logKs,122 = −3.97 (±0.04) at 25°C to −1.89 (±0.03) at 400°C. The solubility constant for the third reaction increases with temperature from logKs,232 = −4.78 (±0.04) at 25°C to −4.57 (±0.18) at 200°C. All solubility constants were found to be independent of pressure within experimental uncertainties. The interaction between Ag+ and HS− at 25°C and 1 bar to form AgHS(aq) has appreciable covalent character, as reflected in the exothermic enthalpy and small entropy of formation. With increasing temperature, the stepwise formation reactions become progressively more endothermic and are accompanied by large positive entropies, indicating greater electrostatic interaction. The aqueous speciation of silver is very sensitive to fluid composition and temperature. Below 100°C silver(I) sulphide complexes predominate in reduced sulphide solutions, whereas Ag+ and AgClOH− are the dominant species in oxidised waters. In high-temperature hydrothermal solutions of seawater salinity, chloride complexes of silver(I) are most important, whereas in dilute hydrothermal fluids of meteoric origin typically found in active geothermal systems, sulphide complexes predominate. Adiabatic boiling of dilute and saline geothermal waters leads to precipitation of silver sulphide and removal of silver from solution. Conductive cooling has insignificant effects on silver mobility in dilute fluids, whereas it leads to quantitative loss of silver for geothermal fluids of seawater salinity.},

abstract = {Crustal or mantle xenoliths are not common in evolved, tholeiitic flood basalts that cover huge areas of the Precambrian shields. Yet, the occasional occurrences provide the most direct and unequivocal evidence on basement composition. Few xenolith occurrences are known from the Deccan Traps, India, and inferences about the Deccan basement have necessarily depended on geophysical studies and geochemistry of Deccan lavas and intrusions. Here, we report two basalt dykes (Rajmane and Talwade dykes) from the central Deccan Traps that are extremely rich in crustal xenoliths of great lithological variety (gneisses, quartzites, granite mylonite, felsic granulite, carbonate rock, tuff). Because the dykes are parallel and only 4??km apart, and only a few kilometres long, the xenoliths provide clear evidence for high small-scale lithological heterogeneity and strong tectonic deformation in the Precambrian Indian crust beneath. Measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the xenoliths range from 0.70935 (carbonate) to 0.78479 (granite mylonite). The Rajmane dyke sampled away from any of the xenoliths shows a present-day 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.70465 and initial (at 66??Ma) ratio of 0.70445. The dyke is subalkalic and fairly evolved (Mg No. = 44.1) and broadly similar in its Sr-isotopic and elemental composition to some of the lavas of the Mahabaleshwar Formation. The xenoliths are comparable lithologically and geochemically to basement rocks from the Archaean Dharwar craton forming much of southern India. As several lines of evidence suggest, the Dharwar craton may extend at least 350-400??km north under the Deccan lava cover. This is significant for Precambrian crustal evolution of India besides continental reconstructions. ?? 2007 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {The solubility of REE(III) fluoride solids was determined in fluoride- and chloride-bearing solutions at 150, 200 and 250 °C and saturated water vapor pressure. These experimental data, together with experimental data from previously published studies, were used to evaluate formation constants for chloride- and fluoride-bearing aqueous species of the entire REE(III) group at temperatures up to 300 °C. The data show that the stability of these species differs significantly from that predicted theoretically. For example, contrary to the theoretical predictions, LREEF2+ species are more stable than HREEF2+ species at elevated temperature. The behavior of the chloride-bearing species is similar. Parameters for the Helgeson–Kirkham–Flowers (HKF) equation of state were determined for REEF2+, REECl2+ and REECl2+ complexes using these experimental data and permit calculation of formation constants of these species at conditions not investigated experimentally. These data now permit the mobility of all REE in fluoride- and chloride-bearing hydrothermal systems to be reliably evaluated at intermediate temperatures and pressures.},

abstract = {In this study, we present Lu–Hf isotope systematics and Lu and Hf abundances for komatiites from the lowermost part of the 2.8 Ga Kostomuksha greenstone belt in the Baltic Shield and compare these, as well as available Sm–Nd isotope data, with those for the best characterized Archean komatiite systems. The Lu–Hf isotope compositions of four spatially associated differentiated lava flows from the Kostomuksha greenstone belt yield an isochron (MSWD = 1.6) with an age of 2931 ± 300 Ma, which represents the first Lu–Hf isochron obtained for a suite of co-magmatic komatiite lavas. The calculated mean initial 176Hf/177Hf for the Kostomuksha komatiite samples is 0.281107 ± 3 (2$\sigma$mean), which corresponds to an initial $\epsilon$176Hf of + 4.9 ± 0.1 (2$\sigma$mean). Assuming that mantle differentiation occurred 10 Ma after Earth's accretion at 4.558 Ga, this precise initial ratio requires a time-integrated 176Lu/177Hf = 0.03759 ± 8, which is identical to the average time-integrated 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0375 ± 6 calculated for the best characterized late Archean komatiite systems. Together with the calculated average time-integrated 147Sm/144Nd = 0.2091 ± 4 for the same late Archean komatiite systems, these parameters represent our best estimate of the Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd properties in the late Archean mantle and indicate derivation of komatiite magmas from around the globe from long-term melt-depleted sources that were remarkably homogenous in terms of lithophile trace element systematics. These time-integrated ratios are identical to the respective values of 0.0375 and 0.209 calculated by Boyet and Carlson (2006) for the so-called Early Depleted Reservoir (EDR), and may indicate that the late Archean mantle was similar in composition to the putative EDR, whereas early Archean systems had higher, and Proterozoic systems lower time-integrated Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd ratios. The observed decrease in time-integrated Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd in komatiite sources over time is interpreted as strong evidence for the existence of a hidden enriched reservoir complementary to the EDR that has been gradually mixed back into the mantle over time. The overall depletion of the early mantle likely occurred very early in Earth's history as a result of either global magma ocean differentiation or extraction and subsequent long-term isolation of primordial terrestrial crust.},

abstract = {The Gross Spitzkoppe is a small (similar to30 km(2)) anorogenic granite stock that was emplaced into the Damara Orogenic Belt of central western Namibia in response to mantle plume activity and early Cretaceous rifting of western Gondwanaland. The epizonal Gross Spitzkoppe stock (GSS), penecontemporaneous mafic and felsic dikes in the country rocks, and synplutonic mafic dikes and mafic magmatic inclusions within the GSS indicate bimodal magmatism. The GSS consists of three zonally arranged granitic units: medium-grained biotite granite at the margins, coarse-grained biotite granite, and porphyritic granite at the center of the stock. Late-stage silicic dikes and pegmatites cut the granites of the stock. All the granites are mildly peraluminous, topaz-bearing, high-silica monzogranites that contain extremely Fe-rich biotite (siderophyllite-annite) as the only primary mafic silicate. Common accessory minerals include: topaz, fluorite, magnetite, zircon, monazite, thorite, ilmenite, columbite, and niobian rutile. Miarolitic cavities and pegmatite pockets within the stock Suggest that fluid saturation was attained. Rectilinear structures of biotite-rich schlieren along the marginal parts of the stock Suggest that magma flow was parallel to the walls of the chamber, whereas turbulent or plume-like flows are indicated by Curved, circular, and ladder-dike schlieren. Geochemical variation among the granites can be attributed to fractional crystallization of major and accessory minerals and by accumulation of halogen complexes with rare-earth and high-field-strength elements. The negative, partially irregular, correlation between whole-rock contents of F and Cl suggests that Cl was partially lost to a vapor phase during magmatic degassing. The granites of the Gross Spitzkoppe show clear A-type and within-plate granite characteristics, corresponding to the actual tectonic setting. The granites are interpreted to have formed by partial crustal remelting related to mafic underplating in a continental rift environment.},

abstract = {Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd and in-situ clinopyroxene Sr and Pb isotope systematics, and mineral major and in-situ trace element compositions were obtained for a suite of non-diamond and diamond-bearing eclogites from the Diavik kimberlites (A154; 55??Ma old), Slave craton (Canada). Temperature estimates of last equilibration in the lithosphere for the non-diamond-bearing Diavik eclogites define two groups; low-temperature (800-1050????C) and high-temperature eclogites (1100-1300????C). Most diamond-eclogites indicate temperatures similar to those of the high-temperature eclogites. Isotopic and major and trace element systematics for the non-diamond- and diamond-bearing eclogites indicate overlapping chemical compositions suggesting similar rock formational histories. Calculated whole rock major and trace element abundances using chemical and modal abundances for constituent minerals exhibit broad similarities with mafic cumulates from ophiolite sequences. Most importantly the calculated whole rock eclogite compositions display positive Sr and Eu anomalies, typically interpreted as the result of plagioclase accumulation in cumulate rocks of oceanic crust sequences. Initial whole rock Hf isotopic values and in-situ Sr isotope data from clinopyroxene grains provide evidence that the eclogites were derived from precursor rocks with depleted mantle isotope characteristics. These combined results support the interpretation that the eclogites from Diavik represent remnants of subducted oceanic crust. Lu-Hf isotope systematics indicate that the oceanic protolith for the eclogites formed in the Paleoproterozoic at ??? 2.1??Ga, which is in agreement with the in-situ Pb isotope data from clinopyroxene. This result also corroborates the ??? 2.1??Ga Lu-Hf model ages recorded by mantle zircons from eclogite found within the Jericho kimberlite in the northern Slave Province (??? 200??km northwest of Diavik). The results from both studies indicate a link between eclogite formation and Paleoproterozoic subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the present-day western margin of the Archean Slave craton. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study examines an individual sill of the Franklin Igneous event for lateral changes in composition, thickness, sorting, and texture to better understand the crystallization history by observing its mineralogical and compositional variations. The sill is one of a series of thin, laterally continuous Proterozoic ({\~{}}720Ma) sills exposed on the northern limb of the Holman Island Syncline, exposed at 72o N latitude on Victoria Island, NWT. The sill in this study is {\textless} 25m meters thick, extends for tens of kilometers along strike, and has a 10 meter thick mafic base rich in olivine crystals, overlain by a thin augite-rich zone and a diabasic upper section. Vertical chemical profiles of the sill were taken, along with sections from drill core data, and examined for lateral changes in thickness and chemical composition of the various sill units. Although thin section examination indicates that the sill has been altered, geochemical modeling suggests that its major and trace element composition has not been significantly affected by the alteration process. Plots of Mg{\#} vs. height have classic S-shaped profiles with a maximum Mg{\#} of 78 and a minimum Mg{\#} of 52. Two favorable possibilities for the development of S-shaped profiles in thin ({\textless} 500m thick) sills are: (1) the emplacement of a phenocryst rich magma that undergoes crystal settling and rapid cooling, or (2) in-situ crystal fractionation with crystal settling and melt migration associated with thermal or compositional convection. It is also conceivable for both of these mechanisms to occur in the same sill to produce the chemical variations seen. Chemical modeling using variation diagrams, Pearce-element-ratio-analysis, olivine mass-balance calculations, and trace element analysis, suggest that this thin sill was emplaced as a phenocryst-rich magma, followed by settling of the initial phenocrysts and rapid cooling, without undergoing significant post-emplacement in-situ differentiation. A thicker sill ({\~{}}43m) of similar bulk composition, emplaced {\~{}}35m above the sill in this study, shows clear evidence for both crystal settling of initial phenocrysts and in-situ differentiation, suggesting that for this mafic magma composition a critical value for in-situ differentiation may be between 25 and 43 meters.},

abstract = {The Diego Hernandez Formation (DHF; 600-ca. 180 ka) represents the products of the most recent complete cycle of phonolitic explosive volcanism on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). We provide a revised and detailed stratigraphy, new 40Ar/39Ar and (U-Th)/He age determinations for major eruptive units, a summary of new chemical data and an overview of the key characteristics of the cycle, including volume estimates, dispersal patterns, eruption styles, phreatomagmatic influences and caldera collapse episodes. The complex stratigraphy of the DHF is divided into 20 named members, each representing a major eruption, as well as numerous unnamed members of limited present-day exposure. The major eruptions are represented by the Fortaleza (370 ka), Roque (347 ka, 3 km3), Aldea (319 ka, 3 km3), Fasnia (309 ka, 13 km3), Poris (268 ka, 3.5 km3), Arafo (4 km3), Caleta (223 ka, 3.5 km3) and Abrigo (between 196 and 171 ka, 20 km3) Members. The Aldea, Fasnia and Poris Members consist of highly complex successions of plinian fall, surge and flow deposits and several of the eruptions produced widespread and internally complex ignimbrite sheets. Phreatomagmatism occurred most frequently in the opening phase of the eruptions but also recurred repeatedly throughout many of the sequences. Inferred sources of water include a shallow caldera lake and groundwater, and intermittent phreatomagmatic activity was an important influence on eruption style. Another important factor was conduit and vent instability, which frequently loaded the eruption column with dense lithic debris and occasionally triggered column collapse and ignimbrite formation. Most of the major DHF eruptions were triggered by injection of mafic magma into existing phonolitic magma bodies. Two phonolitic magma types were available for eruption during the lifetime of the DHF, but each was dominant at different times. The results presented here support a caldera collapse rather than a landslide model for the origin of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera, although the evolution of the caldera is evidently more complex and incremental than first thought. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Santorini volcano in the Aegean region (Greece) is characterized by andesitic- to silicic-dominated explosive activity and caldera-forming eruptions, sourced from magmatic reservoirs located at various structural levels beneath the volcano. There is a good understanding of the silica-rich magmatism of the island whereas the andesite-dominated volcanism and the petrogenesis of the parental mafic magmas are still poorly understood. To fill this gap we have performed crystallization experiments on a representative basalt from Santorini with the aim of determining the conditions of differentiation (pressure, temperature, volatile fugacities) and the parental magma relationship with the andesitic eruptive rocks. Experiments were carried out between 975 and 1040°C, in the pressure range 100–400 MPa, fO2 from QFM to NNO + 3{\textperiodcentered}5 (where QFM is quartz–fayalite–magnetite and NNO is nickel–nickel oxide), with H2Omelt contents varying from saturation to nominally dry conditions. The results show that basalt phenocrysts within the basalt crystallized at around 1040°C in a magma storage reservoir located at a depth equivalent to 200–400 MPa pressure, with 3–5 wt {\%} dissolved H2O, and fO2 around QFM. Comparison with the xenocryst and phenocryst assemblages of the Upper Scoria 1 andesite shows that andesitic liquids are produced by fractionation of a similar basalt at 1000°C and 400 MPa, following 60–80 wt {\%} crystallization of an ol + cpx + plag + Ti-mag + opx ± pig–ilm assemblage, with melt water contents around 4–6 wt {\%}. At Santorini, the andesitic low-viscosity and water-rich residual liquids produced at these depths segregate from the parent basaltic mush and feed the shallow magma reservoirs, eventually erupting upon mixing with resident magma. Changes in prevailing oxygen fugacity may control the tholeiitic–calc-alkaline character of Santorini magmas, explaining the compositional and mineralogical differences observed between the recent Thyra and old eruptive products from Akrotiri.},

abstract = {Isobaric partial melting experiments were performed on an Fe-free synthetic composition to simulate partial melting of subducted oceanic crust. Nominally anhydrous experiments at 3.0 GPa yielded melts in equilibrium with garnet (13 to 16 mol.{\%} grossular) and aluminous clinopyroxene (14 to 16 wt.{\%} Al2O3). Melt compositions show decreasing Si and alkalis and increasing Ca, Mg, and Ti contents with increasing temperatures. Experiments at 1200 and 1300°C were rutile saturated, whereas experiments at 1400°C contained no residual rutile. We argue that during the initial stages of subduction, accessory rutile is likely to be stable in subsolidus eclogites of average midocean ridge basalt composition and that only large degrees of partial melting will eradicate rutile from an eclogitic source. At 3 GPa, any eclogites with a bulk TiO2 content of ≥1.5 wt.{\%} rutile will produce rutile-saturated partial melts, except at very high degrees of melting. At higher pressures, all bulk Ti may dissolve in clinopyroxene and garnet, leaving no accessory rutile.
Trace element partition coefficients for 24 trace elements between clinopyroxene, garnet, and melt were determined by secondary-ion mass spectrometry analysis of experimental run products at 1400°C and 3 GPa. Partition coefficients for the rare earth elements agree well with previous studies and have been evaluated using the lattice strain model. Partitioning data for high–field strength elements indicate complementary DZr/DHf for clinopyroxene and garnet. Partial melting of an eclogitic component of different modal compositions may therefore explain both subchondritic and superchondritic Zr/Hf ratios. Superchondritic Zr/Hf has recently been observed in some ocean island basalts (OIB), and this may be taken as further evidence for components of recycled oceanic crust in OIB. The data also indicate slight Nb/Ta fractionation during partial melting of bimineralic eclogite, which is not, however, sufficient to explain some recently observed Nb/Ta fractionation in island arc rocks. Accessory rutile, however, can explain such fractionation.},

abstract = {In most published hydrothermal ore deposit models, the main agent of metal transport is an aqueous liquid. However, there is increasing evidence from volcanic vapors, geothermal systems (continental and submarine), vapor-rich fluid inclusions, and experimental studies that the vapor phase may be an important and even dominant ore fluid in some hydrothermal systems. This paper reviews the evidence for the transport of metals by vapor (which we define as an aqueous fluid of any composition with a density lower than its critical density), clarifies some of the thermodynamic controls that may make such transport possible, and suggests a model for the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits that involves precipitation of the ores from vapor or a vapor-derived fluid. Analyses of vapor (generally {\textgreater}90{\%} water) released from volcanic fumaroles at temperatures from 500° to over 900°C and near-atmospheric pressure typically yield concentrations of ore metals in the parts per billion to parts per million range. These vapors also commonly deposit appreciable quantities of ore minerals as sublimates. Much higher metal concentrations (from ppm to wt {\%}) are observed in vapor inclusions trapped at pressures of 200 to 1,000 bars in deeper veins at lower temperatures (400°–650°C). Moreover, concentrations of some metals, notably Cu and Au, are commonly higher in vapor inclusions than they are in inclusions of coexisting hypersaline liquid (brine). Experiments designed to determine the concentration of Cu, Sn, Ag, and Au in HCl-bearing water vapor at variable although relatively low pressures (up to 180 bars) partly explain this difference. These experiments show that metal solubility is orders of magnitude higher than predicted by volatility data for water-free systems, and furthermore that it increases sharply with increasing water fugacity and correlates positively with the fugacity of HCl. Thermodynamic analysis shows that metal solubility is greatly enhanced by reaction of the metal with HCl and by hydration, which results in the formation of species such as MeClm.nH2O. Nonetheless, the concentrations measured by these experiments are considerably lower than those measured in experiments involving aqueous liquids or determined for vapor fluid inclusions. A possible explanation for this and for the apparent preference of metals such as Cu and Au for the vapor over the coexisting brine in some natural settings is suggested by limited experimental studies of metal partitioning between vapor and brine. These studies show that, whereas Cu, Fe, and Zn all partition strongly into the liquid in chloride-bearing sulfur-free systems, Cu partitions preferentially into the vapor in the presence of significant concentrations of sulfur. We therefore infer that high concentrations of Cu and Au in vapor inclusions reflect the strong preference of sulfur for the vapor phase and the formation of sulfur-bearing metallic gas species. Phase stability relationships in the system NaCl-H2O indicate how vapor transport of metals may occur in nature, by showing a range of possible vapor evolution paths for the conditions of porphyry-epithermal systems. At the world-class Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Au deposit, evidence from fluid inclusions supports a model in which a single-phase fluid of intermediate to vapor-like density ascends from a magma chamber. On cooling and decompression, this fluid condenses a small fraction of brine by intersecting the two-phase surface on the vapor side of the critical curve, without significantly changing the composition of the expanding vapor. Vapor and brine reach Cu-Fe sulfide saturation as both phases cool below 425°C. Vapor, which is the dominant fluid in terms of the total mass of H2O, Cu, and probably even Cl, is interpreted to be the main agent of metal transport. The evolution of fluids leading to high-grade epithermal gold mineralization is initiated by an H2S-, SO2-, Au-, and variably Cu- and As-rich vapor, which separates from an FeCl2-rich brine in a subjacent porphyry environment. In the early stages of the hydrothermal system, vapor expands rapidly and on reaching the epithermal environment, condenses, producing hypogene advanced argillic alteration and residual vuggy quartz and, in some cases, coeval high-sulfidation precious metal mineralization (e.g., Pascua). More commonly, the introduction of precious metals occurs somewhat later, after the site of magmatic fluid exsolution has receded to greater depth. Because of the relatively high pressure, the vapor separating from brine at this stage cools along a pressure-temperature path above the critical curve of the system, causing it to contract to a liquid capable of transporting several parts per million Au to temperatures as low as 150°C.},

abstract = {Liquidus relations in the four-component system Na2O–Al2O3–SiO2–F2O−1 were studied at 0{\textperiodcentered} 1 and 100 MPa to define the location of fluoride–silicate liquid immiscibility and outline differentiation paths of fluorine-bearing silicic magmas. The fluoride–silicate liquid immiscibility spans the silica–albite–cryolite and silica–topaz–cryolite ternaries and the haplogranite-cryolite binary at greater than 960°C and 0{\textperiodcentered} 1–100 MPa. With increasing Al2O3 in the system and increasing aluminum/alkali cation ratio, the two-liquid gap contracts and migrates from the silica liquidus to the cryolite liquidus. The gap does not extend to subaluminous and peraluminous melt compositions. For all alkali feldspar–quartz-bearing systems, the miscibility gap remains located on the cryolite liquidus and is thus inaccessible to differentiating granitic and rhyolitic melts. In peralkaline systems, the magmatic differentiation is terminated at the albite–quartz–cryolite eutectic at ∼ 770°C, 100 MPa, ∼5 wt {\%} F and cation Al/Na = 0{\textperiodcentered} 75. The addition of topaz, however, significantly lowers melting temperatures and allows strong fluorine enrichment in subaluminous compositions. At 100 MPa, the binary topaz–cryolite eutectic is located at 770°C, 39 wt {\%} F, cation Al/Na ∼ 0{\textperiodcentered} 95, and the ternary quartz–topaz–cryolite eutectic is found at 740°C, 32 wt {\%} F, 30 wt {\%} SiO2 and cation Al/Na ∼ 0{\textperiodcentered} 95. Such location of both eutectics enables fractionation paths of subaluminous quartz-saturated systems to produce fluorine-rich, SiO2-depleted and nepheline-normative residual liquids.},

This gel was oxidized in contact with air and then hydrothermally treated, for a period of 4 weeks, under equilibrium water pressure. The synthesized nontronites were similar to each other, regardless of the synthesis temperature. Their structural formula, obtained from chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), M{\"{o}}ssbauer, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies is: (Si3.25Fe3+0.75)Fe23+O10(OH)2Na0.75. A strictly ferric end-member of the nontronite series was therefore synthesized for the first time. The uncommon chemistry of the synthesized nontronites, notably the high level of Fe-for-Si substitution, induced particular XRD, FTIR, and differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetric analysis data. The ethylene glycol expandability of the synthetic nontronites was linked to their crystallinity and depended on the nature of the interlayer cation, moving from smectite to vermiculite-like behavior. As the synthesis temperature increased, the crystallinity of the synthesized clays increased. The nontronite obtained at 150°C had the ‘best crystallinity', which cannot be improved by increasing synthesis time or temperature. },

This technique can be deployed during volcanic crises to directly track changes in magma components of an erupting system in near-real-time. Such changes are fundamental in controlling eruption style, duration and intensity. We demonstrate a method that can generate data from hundreds of crystals within hours, which allows time-series petrological data to be recorded and interpreted alongside various complementary monitoring techniques (e.g. seismicity, ground deformation). Our direct-detection will allow greater understanding of the dynamics of sub-volcanic magma plumbing systems, and can provide important insights into how an eruption may evolve. The same technique can also be used to generate rich baseline datasets from eruption sequences in the geological record in a more efficient manner than conventional methods allow.},

This calibration results in a more precise older age of 28.201 +/- 0.046 million years ago (Ma) and reduces the 40Ar/39Ar method's absolute uncertainty from approximately 2.5 to 0.25{\%}. In addition, this calibration provides tight constraints for the astronomical tuning of pre-Neogene successions, resulting in a mutually consistent age of approximately 65.95 Ma for the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.},

Determining durations of processes is a key step toward attaining that goal. Records of incomplete diffusive equilibration preserved in minerals are uniquely suited for the purpose of unraveling timescales of a variety of processes. Compositional zoning in minerals is like the tracks of a CD that can be decoded with suitable technology. This review discusses the causes for the limited use of this tool until recently and how these hindrances are being overcome. Examples are presented to illustrate that diffusion modeling can clock processes that last from only a few days to those that last over tens of millions of years, recorded in rocks that range in age from current volcanic eruptions to condensates from the early solar nebula.},

abstract = {The effect of the anhydrous composition on the solubilities of H2O and CO2in mafic melts varying from MORB to nephelinite was investigated experimentally between 50 and 500MPa at 1200 to 1250°C. In all compositions, CO2is only present as carbonate species in the quenched glasses. The concentrations of dissolved H2O and CO2have been analyzed by KFT (Karl-Fischer titration) and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). The Mid-Infrared (MIR) absorption coefficients for the H2O band at 3500cm-1are identical within error for all investigated melt compositions and equal to 59.2±4L/(mol*cm). The absorption coefficients for the carbonate bands vary in the range 306±32 to 360±24L/(mol*cm) for the 1430cm-1band and in the range 349±25 to 394±27L/(mol*cm) for the 1520cm-1band. However, a simple correlation with the melt composition could not be determined.Water solubility in mafic to intermediate melts increases slightly with the total alkali content and the effect of composition is more pronounced at higher pressures. At 500MPa, the solubility of H2O in melts coexisting with nearly pure H2O fluids varies from 8.8 to 9.5wt.{\%} H2O. A strong effect of melt composition on the solubility of CO2is observed at all investigated pressures. For instance, at 500MPa, mafic melts coexisting with nearly pure CO2fluids can dissolve from around 0.32 to more than 1.30wt.{\%} CO2as melt composition changes from tholeiite to nephelinite. The compositional effect on the solubility of CO2in melts coexisting with pure CO2fluid is best described by non-linear (exponential) correlations with compositional parameters such as the parameter $\Pi$ proposed by Dixon (1997; American Mineralogist, 82: 368-378) or structural parameters (e.g., nonbridging oxygen per tetrahedrally coordinated cation). The obtained relationships are used to propose empirically derived equations of the form ln(CO2)=1.150{\textperiodcentered}lnP+6.71{\textperiodcentered}$\Pi$*-1.345, where CO2is the solubility of CO2in silicate melts in wt.{\%} (at 1200 to 1250°C), P is pressure in MPa and $\Pi$* is a compositional parameter ($\Pi$*=Ca2++0.8K++0.7Na++0.4Mg2++0.4Fe2+)/(Si4++Al3+) with cations expressed as cation fractions in melt.},

abstract = {Clinopyroxenes play an important role in determining the distribution of trace elements in magmatic systems. In order to evaluate the extent and source of variation of clinopyroxene-silicate melt partition coefficients (D), experiments were conducted on natural basalts (picrite, alkaline basalt, nephelinite, high-alumina basalt; 1235–1300°C; 1–2.8 GPa) doped with a multi-element spike (Ti, Cr, V, Sr, Y, Zi, Nb, Ta, Hf, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Dy and Yb) and water (2{\%}). Trace-metal concentrations were determined by synchrotron XRF (SXRF) microprobe and a subset of samples were analyzed by SXRF superconducting wiggler and ion microprobe (IMP). Mid-range D-values (by IMP) for clinopyroxene in a picritic starting composition at 1300°C and 1 GPa are: Dti, 0.273; DV, 2.77; DCr, 7.32; DSr, 0.079; DY, 0.376; DZr, 0.089; DNb, 0.003; DHf, 0.179; DTa, 0.010; DLa, 0.03; DCe, 0.054; DNd, 0.112; DSm, 0.201; DDy, 0.280; and DYb, 0.255. D-values for Ta and Zr are lower than adjacent D-values for REE (La and Nd, respectively) on a spider diagram; however, there is no decoupling observed between DTi, DHf and adjacent DREE (DY,Yb).

Many of the experiments resulted in sector-zoned augite, and these constrain the nature of crystal chemical controls on partitioning at fixed T,P,X. Sector-zoned augite in an alkaline basalt at 1250°C and 1 GPa shows enrichment in Ti, Al, Ca, Cr, trace HFSE and REE and depletion in Si, Mg and Fe in the fast-growing (100) sector relative to the slower growing (010) sector. Reverse-zoning in incompatible elements in the (100) sector adjacent to normally-zoned (010) sectors confirms that sector zoning in augite arises from differences in surface kinetic processes (adsorption-desorption) during crystal growth. A positive correlation between IVAl and HFSE concentrations emphasizes the importance of coupled substitution involving highly charged cations in M sites and Al in T sites.},

abstract = {GC and GC/MS/MS analysis on rock extracts has shown that the bitumen in the peralkaline Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusion, previously assumed to be abiogenic, is biotic in origin. A biotic origin is in accordance with previously published stable carbon isotopic data on bituminous matter in the rocks. The biomarker distribution in the bitumen, including the less common bicadinanes, resembles that of oil seeps on the central West Greenland coast 2200 km farther north, whose source rocks and migration history are relatively well established. We use a recent re-construction of the subsidence and later exhumation of the West Greenland coastal region during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic (Japsen et al., 2006a, b) to anticipate that hydrocarbons migrated from deeper parts of the basin offshore west of Greenland. The rocks of Il{\'{i}}maussaq were probably more deeply invaded than the surrounding granites due to their higher proportion of corroded minerals, which may explain why bitumen has not been observed elsewhere in the area. Hydrocarbon gases (C1–C5) present in fluid inclusions were also analysed, after having been released by treatment with hydrochloric acid that resulted in an almost complete disintegration of the Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusion rocks. The acid extraction method proved generally more efficient than the crushing procedure applied by others, but gave similar results for the chemical composition of the gas (CH4: 88–97{\%}) and isotopic ratios ($\delta$13 C CH 4 : −1.6 to −5.0‰; $\delta$13 C C 2 H 6 : −9.2 to −12.5‰), with the exception of hydrocarbons hosted in quartz, which showed significantly lower isotopic values for methane (Graser et al., 2008). Previous researchers have suggested an abiotic origin for these hydrocarbon gases, but we suggest a biotic origin for the majority of them, not just those in quartz, assuming that the isotopic ratio of the constituents have changed due to loss of gas by diffusion. The assumption of gas loss via diffusion is supported by published studies on micro-fissures in minerals typical of the Il{\'{i}}maussaq and field investigations showing diffusive loss of gas from the peralkaline Khibina and Lovozero massifs on the Kola Peninsula, Russia, which are, in many respects of mineralogy and hydrocarbon content, similar to the Il{\'{i}}maussaq intrusion. Both the hydrocarbon gases and bitumen in the Khibina and Lovozero massifs have been cited as prime examples of a deep mantle source, although the carbon isotopic ratio of the bitumen clearly pointed to an organic origin. The trends in carbon isotopic ratio of methane released with time from freshly exposed rocks also supports our hypothesis of 13C enrichment of the methane remaining within the rock. Thus, there is good evidence that the hydrocarbons in the Kola alkaline massifs are mostly biotic in origin, in which case the probability of finding economic hydrocarbon accumulations from a deep mantle source seems exceedingly small.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative model to describe the partitioning of rare earth elements (REE) and Y between clinopyroxene and anhydrous silicate melt as a function of pressure (P), temperature (T) and bulk composition (X). The model is based on the Brice (1975) equation, which relates the partition coefficient of element i (D i ) to that of element o (D o ) where the latter has the same ionic radius r o as the crystallographic site of interest, in this case the clinopyroxene M2 site: N A is Avogadro's number, E M2 is the Young's Modulus of the site, R is the gas constant and T is in K. Values of E M2 obtained by fitting the Brice equation to experimental REE partition coefficient patterns are in good agreement with those obtained from the well-known correlation between bulk modulus, metal-oxygen distance and cation charge. Using this relationship to constrain E M2 for 3+ cations and then fitting the Brice equation to those experimental data where 3 or more REE partition coefficients had been simultaneously measured we obtained 82 values of D o and r o . The latter was found to be a simple and crystallochemically reasonable function of clinopyroxene composition. We show that for any clinopyroxene-melt pair if D for one middle REE (e.g. Sm or Gd) is known then the Brice equation can be used to predict Ds for all the other REE, with uncertainties similar to those involved in the actual measurements. The model was generalised using thermodynamic descriptions of REE components in crystal and melt phases to estimate the free energy of fusion ($\Delta$G f ) of the fictive REE components REEMgAlSiO6 and Na0.5REE0.5MgSi2O6. For the melt we find that 6-oxygen melt components (CaMgSi2O6,NaAlSi2O6, Mg3Si1.5O6 etc.) mix with constant activity coefficient over a wide range of natural compositions. Propagating $\Delta$G f into the Brice model we obtain an expression for D o 3+ in terms of the atomic fraction of Mg on the clinopyroxene M1 site, the Mg-number of the melt, P and T. The D for any REE can be calculated from D o 3+ using the Brice equation. Over 92{\%} of D REE (454 points) calculated in this way lie within a factor 0.63–1.59 of the experimental value. The approach can be extended to calculate D for any REE at a given P (≤6GPa) and T (12002038K) to within 0.60–1.66 times the true value given only the crystal and/or melt composition. The model has widespread applicability to geochemical modelling of all natural processes involving clinopyroxene, e.g. decompression mantle melting, enabling for the first time account to be taken of variations in partition coefficient in response to changing pressure, temperature and phase composition.},

abstract = {The behaviour of niobium and tantalum in magmatic processes has been investigated by conducting MnNb2O6 and MnTa2O6 solubility experiments in nominally dry to water-saturated peralkaline (aluminium saturation index, A.S.I. 0.64) to peraluminous (A.S.I. 1.22) granitic melts at 800 to 1035 °C and 800 to 5000 bars. The attainment of equilibrium is demonstrated by the concurrence of the solubility products from dissolution, crystallization, Mn-doped and Nb- or Ta-doped experiments at the same pressure and temperature. The solubility products of MnNb2O6 (Ksp Nb) and MnTa2O6 (Ksp Ta) at 800 °C and 2 kbar both increase dramatically with alkali contents in water-saturated peralkaline melts. They range from 1.2 × 10−4 and 2.6 × 10−4 mol2/kg2, respectively, in subaluminous melt (A.S.I. 1.02) to 202 × 10−4 and 255 × 10−4 mol2/kg2, respectively, in peralkaline melt (A.S.I. 0.64). This increase from the subaluminous composition can be explained by five non-bridging oxygens being required for each excess atom of Nb5+ or Ta5+ that is dissolved into the melt. The Ksp Nb and Ksp Ta also increase weakly with Al content in peraluminous melts, ranging up to 1.7 × 10−4 and 4.6 × 10−4 mol2/kg2, respectively, in the A.S.I. 1.22 composition. Columbite-tantalite solubilities in subaluminous and peraluminous melts (A.S.I. 1.02 and 1.22) are strongly temperature dependent, increasing by a factor of 10 to 20 from 800 to 1035 °C. By contrast columbite-tantalite solubility in the peralkaline composition (A.S.I. 0.64) is only weakly temperature dependent, increasing by a factor of less than 3 over the same temperature range. Similarly, Ksp Nb and Ksp Ta increase by more than two orders of magnitude with the first 3 wt{\%} H2O added to the A.S.I. 1.02 and 1.22 compositions, whereas there is no detectable change in solubility for the A.S.I. 0.64 composition over the same range of water contents. Solubilities are only slightly dependent on pressure over the range 800 to 5000 bars. The data for water-saturated sub- and peraluminous granites have been extrapolated to 600 °C, conditions at which pegmatites and highly evolved granites may crystallize. Using a melt concentration of 0.05 wt{\%} MnO, 70 to 100 ppm Nb or 500 to 1400 ppm Ta are required for manganocolumbite and manganotantalite saturation, respectively. The solubility data are also used to model the fractionation of Nb and Ta between rutile and silicate melts. Predicted rutile/melt partition coefficients increase by about two orders of magnitude from peralkaline to peraluminous granitic compositions. It is demonstrated that the $\gamma$Nb2O5/$\gamma$Ta2O5 activity coefficient ratio in the melt phase depends on melt composition. This ratio is estimated to decrease by a factor of 4 to 5 from andesitic to peraluminous granitic melt compositions. Accordingly, all the relevant accessory phases in subaluminous to peraluminous granites are predicted to incorporate Nb preferentially over Ta. This explains the enrichment of Ta over Nb observed in highly fractionated granitic rocks, and in the continental crust in general.},

Nepheline s{\"{o}}vites, essentially silicocarbonatites with between 10 and 20{\%} SiO2, contain layers and lenses rich in silicate minerals, interpreted as cumulates. According to phase relationships in the pseudoquaternary system CaO–(Na2O + K2O)–(MgO + FeO)–(SiO2 + TiO2 + Al2O3), neither calcitic ijolites nor the vast majority of calciocarbonatites can represent primary melts. Only the nepheline s{\"{o}}vites, which plot on the silicate–carbonate liquidus boundary, are capable of coprecipitating calcite and silicate phases, which by gravity settling, may yield complementary s{\"{o}}vite and ijolite cumulates. Nepheline s{\"{o}}vites are identified as parental magmas, which through fractionation of Sr-calcite, sodic diopside, Zr–Ti-rich melanite, nepheline, magnetite, apatite and pyrochlore may yield the lineage of SiO2-depleted alvikite and late-stage ferroan dolomitic carbonatites. },

abstract = {This paper presents a comparative geochemical study of Early Cretaceous mafic dike swarms along the rifted volcanic margin of southern Africa from northwestern Namibia to the Cape Peninsula. These dikes are under study to provide a record of magma compositions and conditions of mantle melting at margin segments with high and low magma flux. Our focus is on localities representing the two ends of the spectrum: the Henties Bay-Outjo dike swarm (HOD) in the high magma-flux Etendeka Province of Namibia, and the False Bay dike swarm from the low-flux margin segment in the Western Cape Province, RSA. At False Bay and other localities examined in the south, dikes are low-Ti, tholeiitic dolerites representing a single magma type. Whole-rock MgO contents and olivine compositions in these dikes reach a maximum of 8 weight {\%} and Fo70, respectively. Differentiated dikes (MgO = 6 to 2 weight {\%}) show correlations of trace element and isotopic ratios indicating crustal assimilation, but the least-evolved dikes have uniform incompatible trace element ratios and initial Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions (87Sr/86Sr= 0.7056 to 0.7064, {\{}varepsilon{\}}Nd = -1.9 to -2.3 and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.53 to 18.59) suggesting a lithospheric mantle source or a mixture of enriched lithosphere and asthenospheric sources. The dolerites from the HOD swarm in Namibia are mainly low-Ti tholeiites like their counterparts in the south but with much higher Mg-contents (up to 16 weight {\%} MgO in whole rock and Fo86-90 in olivine). The compositional diversity is also greater in the HOD dikes and at least three magma types are recognized: (1) qz- or ol-normative Tafelberg type, with "spiky" mantle-normalized trace element patterns and initial isotope ratios consistent with a lithospheric mantle source and minor crustal input (87Sr/86Sr= 0.7101 to 0.7122, {\{}varepsilon{\}}Nd = -2 to -7, and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.74 to 19.10); (2) ol-normative Horingbaai-type with trace element patterns and initial isotope ratios similar to E-MORB (87Sr/86Sr= 0.7037 to 0.7050, {\{}varepsilon{\}}Nd = +2 to +6, and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.00 to 18.83); and (3) ne-normative magmas, with moderate to high incompatible trace element abundances and intermediate initial isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr= 0.7055 to 0.7059, {\{}varepsilon{\}}Nd = 0 to -2, and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.30 to 18.61). The contrast in magmatic intensity between the low- and high-flux margin segments corresponds with systematic compositional differences in contemporary dike swarms. This is supported by geophysical evidence for a change in both the thickness and the average seismic velocity of intruded lower crust at the continent-ocean boundary in the two regions. The greater diversity of magma types and the sharp rise in MgO contents of dikes in northwestern Namibia (maximum 8 weight {\%} MgO for False Bay versus 16 weight {\%} MgO for HOD) suggest that elevated temperatures and active upwelling of a mantle plume caused the enhanced melt production in the north. Dolerite compositions from the False Bay swarm and other localities south of the Orange River are consistent with a passive upwelling model without plume enhancement.},

abstract = {Lujavrites are rare meso- to melanocratic agpaitic nepheline syenites that are characterized by elevated contents of elements such as Li, Be, Zr, REE, Nb, Th and U. They are the most evolved members of the three large composite agpaitic complexes - Lovozero, Kola Peninsula, Russia; Pilansberg, South Africa; and Il??maussaq, South Greenland - and are inferred to stem from the same deep fractionating magma sources that fed the earlier members of the complexes. The composition of the melts that evolved into lujavrites is, however, not well known. The agpaitic part of the Il??maussaq complex is divided into a roof series, a floor series of cumulates and an intermediate series of lujavrites sandwiched between the two. In the traditional view, the lujavrites formed from residual melts left between the downward crystallizing roof series and the floor cumulates. New field observations and geochemical data suggest that the floor cumulates and the main mass of lujavrites constituted a separate intrusive phase which was emplaced into the already consolidated roof series rocks largely by piecemeal stoping. Studies of the contact facies of the floor cumulates indicate that the initial magma of the floor cumulate-lujavrite sequence was peralkaline nepheline syenitic with enhanced contents of Zr, Hf, HREE, Y, Nb, Ta, F, Ba and Sr. Subsequent crystallization in a closed system resulted in the formation of the floor cumulates and lujavrites. Chemical analyses of dykes within and outside the complex represent stages in the magmatic evolution of the agpaitic rocks. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Diego Hernandez Formation (DHF; 600–ca. 180 ka) represents the products of the most recent complete cycle of phonolitic explosive volcanism on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). We provide a revised and detailed stratigraphy, new 40Ar/39Ar and (U–Th)/He age determinations for major eruptive units, a summary of new chemical data and an overview of the key characteristics of the cycle, including volume estimates, dispersal patterns, eruption styles, phreatomagmatic influences and caldera collapse episodes. The complex stratigraphy of the DHF is divided into 20 named members, each representing a major eruption, as well as numerous unnamed members of limited present-day exposure. The major eruptions are represented by the Fortaleza (370 ka), Roque (347 ka, 3 km3), Aldea (319 ka, 3 km3), Fasnia (309 ka, 13 km3), Poris (268 ka, 3.5 km3), Arafo (4 km3), Caleta (223 ka, 3.5 km3) and Abrigo (between 196 and 171 ka, 20 km3) Members. The Aldea, Fasnia and Poris Members consist of highly complex successions of plinian fall, surge and flow deposits and several of the eruptions produced widespread and internally complex ignimbrite sheets. Phreatomagmatism occurred most frequently in the opening phase of the eruptions but also recurred repeatedly throughout many of the sequences. Inferred sources of water include a shallow caldera lake and groundwater, and intermittent phreatomagmatic activity was an important influence on eruption style. Another important factor was conduit and vent instability, which frequently loaded the eruption column with dense lithic debris and occasionally triggered column collapse and ignimbrite formation. Most of the major DHF eruptions were triggered by injection of mafic magma into existing phonolitic magma bodies. Two phonolitic magma types were available for eruption during the lifetime of the DHF, but each was dominant at different times. The results presented here support a caldera collapse rather than a landslide model for the origin of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas Caldera, although the evolution of the caldera is evidently more complex and incremental than first thought.},

abstract = {Elemental and isotopic (Sr, Nd and Pb) analyses of silicate and carbonatite rocks from Brava, the southernmost island of the Cape Verde archipelago, are reported here to assess the nature, origin and location of the main contributors to magma composition and to evaluate the chemical evolution of magma through time. In contrast to other islands of the archipelago where a continuous range is usually observed, Brava is clearly characterized by two groups of distinct isotopic compositions. Rocks from the Upper Unit ({\textless}. 0.5. Ma) are less Nd- and Pb-radiogenic and more Sr-radiogenic than rocks belonging to the Basal Complex ({\~{}}. 3 to 1.4. Ma), which are also characterized by more unradiogenic He signatures. Here, the chemistry of the Basal Complex is mainly explained by the mixing of a high-$\mu$ (HIMU)-type local end-member, which represents an ancient ({\~{}}. 1.3. Ga) recycled oceanic crust, with the lower mantle. For the Upper Unit, elemental and isotopic signatures suggest the involvement of an additional local end-member akin to the EM1-type. Such differences in the contributing end-members to the Upper Unit and Basal Complex sources mirror those usually assigned to the southern and northern Cape Verde islands, respectively. This temporal evolution is discussed in light of plume interaction with a shallow EM1-type domain, which is considered to represent the subcontinental lithosphere floating in the asthenosphere. Brava carbonatites define two distinct groups with similar isotopic ranges as those observed for the coeval alkaline silicate rocks. This observation suggests that, in each of the volcano-stratigraphic units, carbonatite and silicate magmas are ultimately derived from the same sources. We propose that calciocarbonatites from either the Basal Complex or the Upper Unit resulted from nephelinite-carbonatite liquid immiscibility, while the subordinate Basal Complex magnesiocarbonatites represent residual liquids after calcite fractionation from carbonatite magma. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Nd and Sr compositions of the highly evolved agpaitic nepheline syenites and associated ijolites and carbonatites from the Khibina and the Lovozero alkaline centres define three magma sources. Isotopes of the voluminous nepheline syenites and ijolites of Khibina intrusions III, IV, V, VI and VII as well as of nepheline syenites of Lovozero lie on the Kola Carbonatite Mixing Line which is close to the “mantle array” defined by the components “bulk earth” and “prema” on a SrNd plot. The Khibina carbonatites and associated silicate rocks of intrusion VIII, which have more radiogenic Sr, did not evolve from the same parent magma as the nepheline syenites. Isotopic constraints exclude a pre-enrichment of Rb, Sr, Sm and Nd in the lithospheric mantle below Kola over more than 10 Ma prior to the crystallization of the magmas. A formation of the melts involving major participation of the Precambrian crust of the Baltic Shield is also excluded. The lack of significant Eu anomalies in the Lovozero nepheline syenites gives evidence that the agpaitic magmas in the Kola region did not form from basaltic liquids by fractional crystallization of plagioclase or anorthoclase at crustal levels. A formation from nephelinite or nepheline benmoreite magmas at mantle pressures is more likely, possibly by dynamic flow crystallization. Enrichment factors suggest that large-ion lithophile and high field-strength elements as Ta, La, Nb and Zr, which are highly concentrated in the agpaites, were scavenged from mantle volumes of some 100,000 km3. An enrichment of these elements prior to magma formation may have been performed by volatile transfer. The well-defined whole-rock isochrons of the Khibina III–VII and the Lovozero agpaites of c. 370 Ma date the magma separation for the different intrusion, if these melts are cogenetic and formed by fractional crystallization in a Khibina and a Lovozero magma chamber. If, however, Rb and Sr were collected by a process of volatile transfer, and the initial Sr isotopic compositions of the two distinguished agpaite suites are, therefore, averages of the sampled mantle volumes, the RbSr whole-rock isochron ages of c. 370 Ma would date this process of element collection. The concordance of the whole-rock ages with the mineral ages of Khibina and Lovozero samples is then further evidence for the short period between magma genesis, intrusion and crystallization.},

abstract = {Fluorine and chlorine affect phase stabilities in magmatic rocks. We present phase equilibrium experiments investigating a peralkaline and iron-rich phonolitic composition with variable F and Cl contents. The starting composition represents a dyke rock, which is a possible parental melt to the peralkaline Il{\'{i}}maussaq plutonic complex (South Greenland). Experiments were performed at 100 MPa, 1,000–650 °C and low oxygen fugacity adjusted with graphite-lined gold capsules in an internally heated argon pressure vessel and rapid quench cold seal pressure vessels. To cover this large T interval, we applied a two-step fractional crystallization strategy where glasses representing residual melt compositions at 800 °C were synthesized as starting material for consecutive experiments at lower T. In these experiments, oxidized starting glasses allocate oxygen by reduction of ferric iron and up to 1.2 wt{\%} dissolved OH form through reaction with hydrogen provided by the pressure medium (H2O) in initially dry experiments. For OH determination, hydrated super-liquidus experiments in Au capsules were performed to calibrate the extinction coefficient for the fundamental OH stretching vibration using infrared spectroscopy ($\epsilon$ 3,415 = 48 ± 3 L mol−1 cm−1). Observed mineral phases in our experiments are titanomagnetite, fayalitic olivine, clinopyroxene, aenigmatite (Na2Fe5TiSi6O20), alkali feldspar and nepheline (±native iron) coexisting with residual melt. Above 1.5 wt{\%} Fmelt concentrations, fluorite (CaF2) and hiortdahlite (Ca6Zr2Si4O16F4) are stable in favor of Ca-rich clinopyroxene. Sodalite (Na8Al6Si6O24Cl2) and eudialyte (Na15Ca6Fe3Zr3Si26O73(OH)3Cl2) form at Clmelt concentrations of 0.2–0.5 wt{\%} (depending on T) and ZrO2 melt concentrations {\textgreater}0.7 wt{\%} are additionally needed to stabilize eudialyte and hiortdahlite. Therefore, F and Cl may become compatible in such systems and have the potential to influence F/Cl melt ratios in evolving magmas.},

abstract = {We present the first integrated study of carbonate, hydroxyl, fluoride, and chloride ion partitioning in the apatite-melt system. We determined volatile partitioning behavior between apatite and silicate melt for both haplobasaltic andesite and trachyte bulk compositions at 0.5–1 GPa and 1250°C using the piston-cylinder apparatus. All volatile species were analyzed directly in both apatite and glass using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and electron probe microanalysis. Distribution coefficients for OH-halogen exchange are similar to those from previous studies, and together with literature data, reveal a significant log-linear relationship with temperature, while the effects of pressure and melt composition are minimal. Meanwhile, halogen-free experiments generate very high C contents (up to 5000 ppm) in apatite. Stoichiometry calculations and infrared spectra indicate that this C is mainly incorporated onto the channel volatile site together with hydroxyl. In halogen-bearing experiments, apatite crystals contain significantly lower C (≤500 ppm), which may be partly incorporated onto the phosphate site while the channel volatile site is filled by OH+F+Cl+C. Our experiments give the first constraints on H2O-CO2 exchange between apatite and silicate melt, with a KD of 0.355 ± 0.05 for the trachyte and 0.629 ± 0.08 for the haplobasaltic andesite. The new constraints on the temperature-dependence of partitioning will enable quantitative modeling of apatite-volatile exchange in igneous systems, while this new partitioning data and method for direct, in situ analysis of C in apatite mark a significant advance that will permit future studies of magmatic C and other volatiles. This has a broad range of potential applications including magmatic differentiation, fractionation, and degassing; quantification of volatile budgets in extraterrestrial and deep earth environments; and mineralization processes.},

abstract = {This study explores some of the effects of major element compositional variations on the partitioning of trivalent rare earth elements between high-Ca clinopyroxene and silicate melt. Experiments performed in the system CaOMgOA12O3SiO2 at 1 atm pressure, over a small temperature range, differentiate crystal-chemical controls on mineral/melt partitioning from the effects of pressure and temperature. The experimental results demonstrate that the Ca-Tschermakite content of high-Ca clinopyroxene exercises an important control on rare earth element partitioning for pyroxene coexisting with basaltic melt. A comparison of our experimental results with those from two-liquid partitioning and thermal diffusion studies demonstrates that melt structure has only a minor influence on clinopyroxene/melt partitioning for basaltic compositions, but becomes progressively more important as polymerization of the melt increases. Melt structure exercises the dominant control on partitioning for highly polymerized melts such as high-silica rhyolites. Semiempirical expressions developed using equilibrium constants for pyroxene/melt exchange reactions successfully predict the partitioning of Ce3+ and Yb3+ for a broad range of synthetic and natural coexisting melt and clinopyroxene compositions. The ability of our model to predict the partitioning behavior of trivalent rare earth elements over a wide range of experimental conditions (0.0001–3.0 GPa; 1234–1430°C) indicates that consideration of the compositions of coexisting clinopyroxene and melt is adequate to account for the effects of varying pressure and temperature.},

abstract = {The Laki (Skaft{\'{a}}r Fires) fissure eruption in southern Iceland lasted for eight months during 1783 to 1784, and produced one of the largest basaltic lava flows in historic times (14.7±1.0 km3). In addition, neighboring Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn central volcano was frequently active during the period from May 1783 to May 1785. The combined activity is interpreted as having been the result of a two-year-long volcano-tectonic episode on the Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn volcanic system. Contemporary descriptions of the explosive activity make it possible to relate the tephra stratigraphy to the progress of the eruption on a weekly basis and show that activity on the fissures propagated to the NE with time, towards Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn. The eruption at Laki began on 8 June with a brief explosive event on a short fissure, and lava rapidly began to flow into the Skaft{\'{a}} river gorge. It reached the lowlands, 35 km away, four days later and continued to flow, with variable discharge, until 7 February 1784. Approximately 90{\%} of the lava was emplaced in the first five months of activity. The 27-km-long vent complex is composed of tenen echelon fissures distributed on both sides of the much older Laki hyaloclastite mountain. The surface expression of each fissure is a continuous row of vents consisting of scoria cones, spatter cones, and tuff cones. Six tephra fall units are positively identified; two units are completely compsed of phreatomagmatic tephra derived from two tuff cones and the others are Strombolian deposits. The volume of tephra, including ash fall that extended to mainland Europe, is 0.4 km3 dense rock equivalent volume, or 2.6{\%} of the total erupted volume. Interpretation of contemporary descriptions of tephra falls, combined with the preserved stratigraphy, allow the identification of ten eruptive episodes during the eight months of activity on the Laki fissures. These eruptive episodes are inferred to have resulted from the unsteady flow of magma in the feeder system. In addition, at least eight eruption episodes occurred at Gr{\'{i}}msv{\"{o}}tn in 1783 to 1785, five in 1783, two in 1784, and one in 1785. Each episode at Laki began with a seismic swarm of increasing intensity that led to the formation of a new fissure, the opening of which was followed by short-lived phreatomagmatic activity caused by the high water table around the eruption site. Activity usually changed to violent Strombolian or sub-Plinian, followed by Hawaiian fire fountaining and effusive activity as the availability of groundwater dwindled. Thus, the explosive activity associated with the opening of each fissure was largely controlled by external watermagma interactions. Maximum effusion rates, occurring in the first two episodes, are estimated to have been 8.5x103 and 8.7x103 m3 s-1 from fissures totaling 2.2 and 2.8 km in length, respectively, and, in general, discharge gradually decreased over time. The highest rates are equivalent to 5.6x103 and 4.5x103 kg s-1 per meter length of fissure, values that could conceivably be similar to those that produced some flood basalt lava flows. Maximum fire fountain heights are estimated to have varied from 800 m to 1400 m and convecting eruption columns above the vents rose to a maximum altitude of about 15 km. The release of sulfur gases during fountaining produced an acid haze (aerosol) which spread widely and had a considerable environmental, and possibly climatic, impact on the Northern Hemisphere.},

Magmatic compositions exert only second-order control, mainly on alteration mineralogy and on element abundances. Hot S-poor brines generated by interaction with evaporitic materials are consistent with geologic settings and help rationalize the distinctive element enrichments (siderophile, lithophile) and hydrothermal alteration (sodic, locally alkaline) found in these systems.

abstract = {Lithic occurrences within Quaternary phonolitic ignimbrites on Tenerife (Canary Islands) fall into three broad groupings: (1) massive ignimbrite with large `floating' lithics; (2) basal lithic-rich bedforms; and (3) matrix- to clast-supported lithic breccias within ignimbrite. Massive ignimbrite divisions commonly contain large (outsized), either solitary or scattered lithics, which are mostly monomictic, and derived locally from substrate erosion by pyroclastic density currents. Low- and high-aspect ratio, lithic-rich bedforms occur at the base of several ignimbrites. Most bedforms are asymmetric, with steeper lee-sides, and they are buried by stratified and/or massive ignimbrite. Internally, most bedforms are massive. Some, however, exhibit an upstream-inclined stratification, indicating upcurrent migration of the bedform, which is interpreted to record antidune-like flow regimes. Locally-derived basalt clasts are important constituents of some of these bedforms, which have also been sourced through substrate erosion. Matrix- to clast-supported, pebble- to boulder-sized lithic breccias occur at various heights within massive ignimbrite. Lithic breccias at or near the top of most ignimbrites contain vent-derived lithics, and record a late flux of lithic material from the vent during a sustained pyroclastic flow event. Extensive, boulder-sized breccias at the top of two ignimbrites are interpreted to record the onset of caldera collapse late in the pyroclastic flow-forming eruptions. Some breccias contain boulders that are oriented with long-axes transverse to flow, indicating late-stage tractional transport. Thin-bedded, matrix-supported lithic breccias or lithic trains and stratified ignimbrite are commonly developed adjacent to, or immediately above topographic highs. These facies laterally merge into massive ignimbrite infilling topographic lows. Massive ignimbrite is interpreted to be deposited from a high particle concentration, hindered settling zone. Inverse grading and long-axis parallel to bedding imbrication of lithics within the thin-bedded breccia facies are interpreted to record deposition under modified grain flow conditions. A variety of depositional processes are thus recorded, and the relationship between lithic breccias/ignimbrite facies and topography indicates that there were spatial variations in depositional mechanisms at any one instant. The vertical sequence of bedform–stratified ignimbrite–massive ignimbrite characterises the lower part of several ignimbrites, and is interpreted to record increasing rates of deposition from a sustained current. Multilayered lithic breccias at various heights within massive ignimbrite are a form of clast compositional zonation, and reflect temporal changes in supply, flow competence and capacity.},

abstract = {Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet(1). While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs(2,3). Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust(4-7). Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the effect of increasing melt peralkalinity on partitioning, partition coefficients have been determined using neutron activation analyses of coexisting phenocrysts and glass of five samples from Pantelleria spanning the range trachyte to pantellerite. Alkali feldspar partition coefficients for Fe, Rb, Ba, Sr, and Eu vary with melt peralkalinity due to changes in melt polymerization and to the systematic increase in Xor and decrease in Xan of the feldspar. In going from trachyte to pantellerite, Fe partition coefficients increase from 0.04 to 0.10, presumably because Fe+3 increasingly substitutes in the feldspar tetrahedral site as melt activity of Al declines and Fe concentrations increase. Partition coefficients for trivalent light REEs decrease and the partitioning pattern becomes flatter, the most evolved samples having some of the lowest published values for feldspar. The hundredfold decline in Eu partition coefficients (2.5 to 0.024) and the decrease in the size of the positive partitioning anomaly are attributed to increasing Eu3+/Eu2+ in the melt as it becomes more peralkaline, as well as to concomitant decrease in the Ca content of feldspar. As a result, the behavior of Eu during fractional crystallization of peralkaline suites is fundamentally different from that in metaluminous suites; absolute abundances rise and the size of the negative Eu anomaly changes little with fractionation beyond pantelleritic trachyte. Barium and strontium do not decline to extremely low concentrations in pantellerites, as they do in highly evolved metaluminous rhyolites, because the feldspar partition coefficients drop precipitously with peralkalinity. Similarly, Rb contents do not get large because the partition coefficient increases slightly (0.11 to 0.25) with peralkalinity and is sufficient to make Rb only weakly incompatible in the feldspar-dominated assemblage. Partition coefficients calculated for Sr and Ba from natural phenocryst-matrix pairs can be gross over-estimates in these feldspar-rich felsic rocks if phenocrysts are zoned. This effect is severe for assemblages with bulk distribution coefficients (D) greater than 4 even at very small crystal contents, and for 4 {\textgreater}D {\textgreater} 2 it is significant if crystal contents exceed about 25{\%}. Some of the very high values and much of the variability reported in the literature for Ba and Sr feldspar partition coefficients may be a result of this effect. In contrast to feldspar, partition coefficients for apatite and mafic phases change little with peralkalinity. Partition coefficients for REEs and the compatible elements Sc, Co, and Cr are all less than half those in Fe-rich clinopyroxene and olivine of similar composition in high-silica rhyolite. Although absolute levels of partition coefficients are a function of melt polymerization, the shapes of the REE partitioning patterns appear to be related to the composition of the clinopyroxene. Scandium is most strongly concentrated in clinopyroxene (partition coefficient = 27–60), having larger values in more Fe-rich compositions. Apatite shows a wide range in composition within the suite, the concentrations of Si, Fe, REEs, and Y increasing and Mg, Ca, and P decreasing in more evolved samples. These trends, however, parallel those in coexisting glasses, so that partition coefficients are essentially constant. In peralkaline suites, Cs is the most incompatible of commonly analyzed elements, but its great mobility during alteration and weathering limits its use as a differentiation index. Next in order of incompatibility are Th, U, Hf, Zr, and Ta, which have small, but finite, values of D due to the partitioning of Th and U into apatite ({\~{}}2), the accommodation of Zr and Hf by clinopyroxene ({\~{}}0.4) and titanomagnetite ({\~{}}0.2), and relatively high concentrations of Ta in cossyrite and Fe-Ti oxides. The next most incompatible are the lightest and the heaviest REEs, and, finally, the middle trivalent REEs and Rb. Plots of pairs of relatively incompatible elements form straight-line trends over large compositional ranges in peralkaline suites because the replacement of olivine + titanomagnetite by cossyrite, as the melt becomes more peralkaline, causes little change in D; the REE patterns of titanomagnetite and cossyrite are both approximately flat at values less than 0.1, and the relatively high titanomagnetite partition coefficients for Ta ({\~{}}2), Zr, and Hf, when combined with the very low partition coefficients for these elements for olivine, approximate the moderate partition coefficients for cossyrite.},

abstract = {Compared to all published data from carbonatites and granitoids, the fluorapatite compositions in the Songwe Hill carbonatite, determined by EPMA and LA ICP-MS, have the highest heavy (H)REE concentration of any carbonatite apatite described so far. A combination of this fluorapatite and the REE fluorocarbonates, synchysite-(Ce) and parisite-(Ce), which are the other principal REE bearing minerals at Songwe, gives a REE deposit with a high proportion of Nd and a higher proportion of HREE (Eu???Lu including Y) than most other carbonatites. Since Nd and HREE are currently the most sought REE for commercial applications, the conditions that give rise to this REE profile are particularly important to understand. Multiple apatite crystallisation stages have been differentiated texturally and geochemically at Songwe and fluorapatite is divided into five different types (Ap-0???4). While Ap-0 and Ap-1 are typical of apatite found in fenite and calcite-carbonatite, Ap-2, -3 and -4 are texturally atypical of apatite from carbonatite and are progressively HREE-enriched in later paragenetic stages. Ap-3 and Ap-4 exhibit anhedral, stringer-like textures and their REE distributions display an Y anomaly. These features attest to formation in a hydrothermal environment and fluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures indicate crystallisation occurred between 200???350 ??C. Ap-3 crystallisation is succeeded by a light (L)REE mineral assemblage of synchysite-(Ce), strontianite and baryte. Finally, late-stage Ap-4 is associated with minor xenotime-(Y) mineralisation and HREE-enriched fluorite. Fluid inclusions in the fluorite constrain the minimum HREE mineralisation temperature to approximately 160 ??C. A model is suggested where sub-solidus, carbonatite-derived, (carbo)-hydrothermal fluids remobilise and fractionate the REE. Chloride or fluoride complexes retain LREE in solution while rapid precipitation of apatite, owing to its low solubility, leads to destabilisation of HREE complexes and substitution into the apatite structure. The LREE are retained in solution, subsequently forming synchysite-(Ce). This model will be applicable to help guide exploration in other carbonatite complexes.},

abstract = {[1] A detailed study of 43 lava flows comprising two stratigraphic sequences exposed along the north and south walls of Barranco de los Tilos on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands, reveals a complex, temporally segmented record of geodynamo behavior that contains no less than three distinct geomagnetic events. The Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) reversal is recorded in five transitionally magnetized lava flows from the north (TN) section. The isochrons obtained from three of the lower four M-B lavas are defined by 14 incremental heating experiments that, together with a previous age determination, yielded a weighted mean of 798.4 +/- 6.2 ka (all uncertainties +/-2sigma). In addition, a 780.3 +/- 10.3 ka isochron was determined for the overlying transitionally magnetized flow, indicating that it was erupted during a distinctly younger portion of the transition. Near the base of the south (TS) section one finds a sequence of weakly magnetized flows associated with virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) positions in the southwest Indian Ocean between latitudes 56degreesS and 65degreesS, suggesting instability of the geomagnetic field beyond that of typical secular variation. Ar-40/Ar-39 isochrons from three of these flows, defined by 11 separate incremental heating experiments, gave a weighted mean of 822.2 +/- 8.7 ka. This anomalous field behavior recorded 24 +/- 11 kyr prior to the M-B reversal may coincide with an event featured in several marine sediment records. Directly above two normal polarity flows (Ar-40/Ar-39 isochrons of 751.9 +/- 18.1 ka and 675.0 +/- 15.7 ka) are nine transitionally magnetized lavas having magnetization directions associated with low to midlatitude VGPs spanning 23degrees-60degreesN. These flows are then capped by a single flow possessing normal polarity. Based on 12 incremental heating experiments, Ar-40/Ar-39 isochrons of five of these nine lavas, along with the uppermost flow, gave a weighted mean age of 580.2 +/- 7.8 ka for this period of transitional to normal field behavior. From these same transitional lavas, Quidelleur et al. [1999] reported three unspiked K-Ar ages with a weighted mean of 602 +/- 24 ka and proposed a new event called the "La Palma'' excursion. However, the Ar-40/Ar-39 age presented here is three times more precise than the K-Ar age and is indistinguishable at the 95{\%} confidence level from the Ar-40/Ar-39 age of a lava from the Snake River Plain, Idaho, that originally defined the Big Lost event. Transitional field behavior of similar age observed in astronomically dated marine cores further establishes that the Big Lost event recorded at La Palma was indeed global in extent. Rigorous temporal and geomagnetic constraints for several additional periods of geomagnetic field instability during the last several million years will comprise a geomagnetic instability timescale that can be factored confidently into models of the dynamo process},

abstract = {The Archean Greer Lake leucogranite intruded metabasalts of the Bird River Greenstone Belt in the southwestern part of the Superior Province of southeastern Manitoba. The considerably evolved, multiphase, peraluminous, B-, P-, and S-poor leucogranite (K/Rb 132 to 24) was probably generated by fault-friction-assisted anatexis of dominantly metatonalitic rocks and subsequent differentiation. The leucogranite produced interior, transitional, non-crosscutting pods of barren, beryl-columbite- and lepidolite-subtype pegmatites that solidified from local segregations of highly fractionated residual melt. Steep fractionation gradients characterize the granite-to-pegmatite transition, most conspicuously so in the case of the most evolved, Li, Rb, Cs, Be, Mn, Sn, Nb-Ta, F-rich, lepidolite-subtype pod AC {\#}3 (with K/Rb ≥ 16 and Cs 330 ppmwt in accessory K-feldspar, ≥2.5 and ≤11,200 ppmwt, respectively, in lepidolite, Cs ≤28,000 ppmwt in beryl, and Ta/(Ta+Nb) at. ≤0.95 in manganotantalite). The Greer Lake example documents beyond any doubt the igneous derivation of lepidolite-subtype pegmatites from a plutonic parent. Most cases of generally very scarce lepidolite-subtype pegmatites obscure this relationship, as the volatile-rich, highly fluid melts stable to relatively low temperatures commonly migrate to great distances from their plutonic sources. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The relatively low rates of magma production in island arcs and continental extensional settings require that the volume of silicic magma involved in large catastrophic caldera-forming (CCF) eruptions must accumulate over periods of 105 to 106 years. We address the question of why buoyant and otherwise eruptible high-silica magma should accumulate for long times in shallow chambers rather than erupt more continuously as magma is supplied from greater depths. Our hypothesis is that the viscoelastic behavior of magma chamber wall rocks may prevent an accumulation of overpressure sufficient to generate rhyolite dikes that can propagate to the surface and cause an eruption. The critical overpressure required for eruption is based on the model of Rubin (1995a). An approximate analytical model is used to evaluate the controls on magma overpressure for a continuously or episodically replenished spherical magma chamber contained in wall rocks with a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology. The governing parameters are the long-term magma supply, the magma chamber volume, and the effective viscosity of the wall rocks. The long-term magma supply, a parameter that is not typically incorporated into dike formation models, can be constrained from observations and melt generation models. For effective wall-rock viscosities in the range 1018 to 1020 Pa s–1, dynamical regimes are identified that lead to the suppression of dikes capable of propagating to the surface. Frequent small eruptions that relieve magma chamber overpressure are favored when the chamber volume is small relative to the magma supply and when the wall rocks are cool. Magma storage, leading to conditions suitable for a CCF eruption, is favored for larger magma chambers ({\textgreater}102 km3) with warm wall rocks that have a low effective viscosity. Magma storage is further enhanced by regional tectonic extension, high magma crystal contents, and if the effective wall-rock viscosity is lowered by microfracturing, fluid infiltration, or metamorphic reactions. The long-term magma supply rate and chamber volume are important controls on eruption frequency for all magma chamber sizes. The model can explain certain aspects of the frequency, volume, and spatial distribution of small-volume silicic eruptions in caldera systems, and helps account for the large size of granitic plutons, their association with extensional settings and high thermal gradients, and the fact that they usually post-date associated volcanic deposits.},

abstract = {Experimental study of natural alkalic lava compositions at low pressures (pO2∼QFM) reveals that crystallization of primitive lavas often occurs in the sequence olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, nepheline without “obvious” reaction relation. Pseudoternary liquidus projections of multiply saturated liquids coexisting with plagioclase (±olivine±clinopyroxene±nepheline) have been prepared to facilitate graphical analysis of the evolution of lava compositions during hypabyssal cooling. Use of (TiAl2)(MgSi2)−1 and Fe3+ (Al)−1 exchange components is a key aspect of the projection procedure which is succesful in reducing a wide range of compositions to a systematic graphical representation. These projections, and the experiments on which they are based, show that low pressure fractionation plays a significant role in the petrogenesis of many alkalic lava suites from both continental and oceanic settings. However, the role of polybaric fractionation is more evident in the major element chemistry of these lava suites than in many tholeiitic suites of comparable extent. For example, the lavas of Karisimbi, East Africa, show a range of compositions reflecting a polybaric petrogenesis from primitive picrites at 1360° C/18 kb and leading to advanced low pressure differentiates. Evolved leucite-bearing potassic members of this and other suites may be treated in a nepheline-diopside-kspar (+olivine+leucite) projection. Compositional curvature on the plagioclase+clinopyroxene+olivine+leucite cotectic offers a mechanism to explain resorption of plagioclase in alkalic groundmass assemblages and the incompatibility of albite and leucite. This projection is useful for evaluating the extent of assimilation of the alkalic portions of crustal granulites. Assimilation appears to have played some role in the advanced differentiates from Karisimbi.},

abstract = {Cumulus olivine, clinopyroxene, melilite and perovskite from silicate rocks and carbonatites of the Gardiner (East Greenland) and Kovdor (Kola Peninsula) ultramafic alkaline complexes contain primary melt inclusions crystallized into aggregates of daughter minerals. The petrography and homogenization temperatures of the inclusions constrain the fractionation paths and the formation of carbonatites in the complexes. Carbonated melanephelinite was parental to both complexes and early cumulates (dunite, olivinite, peridotite and melteigite) are comparable. The common occurrence of phlogopite and amphibole in the inclusions and in the host rocks indicates that these were important liquidus phases. In both complexes the fractionation of phlogopite and amphibole drove the melts towards Ca-rich (larnite-normative) compositions. At the ijolite stage the evolutionary trends are believed to separate and the evolved larnite-normative melt produced calcite-bearing ijolite in Kovdor and melilitolite in Gardiner. The two assemblages are related by decarbonation reactions. A fractional crystallization origin is suggested for the Kovdor carbonatite, whereas the Gardiner carbonatite formed by liquid immiscibility in the course of melilite fractionation. Na–K–Ca and Na–Mg carbonates are common daughter phases and especially abundant in late-stage inclusions. Thus, all carbonatite melts in the two complexes are alkaline. Calcite carbonatites appear to be cumulates.},

Podiform chromite deposits are distinctive discontinuous concentrations of chromite commonly enveloped by dunite, typically characterized by nodular and orbicular chromite textures, and they may be very irregular in shape, size, and distribution within the host rocks. Podiform chromite deposits are generally associated with harzburgites and only reported in ophiolites and oceanic lithosphere. The North China craton is divided into two major blocks, the Western Block and the Eastern Block, separated by the Neoarchean Central Orogenic Belt. The Zunhua structural belt contains various tectonic slices, including tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite gneiss, mafic plutonic rocks, supracrustal sequences and granites, all complexly intercalated with each other, intruded by ca. 2.56–2.5 Ga tonalitic gneiss, then 2.5–2.4 Ga granites. In the inner parts of massive chromite bodies, nodular and orbicular chromites show sedimentary-style bedding with size-graded layers and dense cumulate layers that form massive ores.},

Fenite zircon was dated by LA-MC-ICP-MS with the U–Pb method at 1.49 ± 0.01 Ga, while the unaltered country rock granite was dated at 1.79 ± 0.01 Ga. Zircon in the fenites exhibits $\epsilon$Hf+ 6.58 ± 0.36 at 1.49 Ga; significantly above the expected value for Svecofennian crust at that time (ca. − 5 ± 2), but identical, within error, of that measured in eudialyte from Norra K{\"{a}}rr. This suggests a common source of Hf for fenite zircon and eudialyte from Norra K{\"{a}}rr, which isotopically strengthens the genetic link between fenite and nepheline syenite. The 1.49 Ga age dates not only the fenitisation, but also the relatively small agpaitic intrusion, which caused the fenitisation. This also dates the origin of the rare-earth element and Zr ore within the agpaitic nepheline syenite, which probably formed from an evolved magma derived from the mantle. A few zircon xenocrysts, which survived in the agpaitic nepheline syenite magma, may indicate the presence of an Archaean component in the basement.},

abstract = {We have combined metal–silicate partitioning data from the literature with new experimental results at 1.5–8 GPa and 1480–2000 °C to parameterize the effects of pressure, temperature and composition on the partitioning of V, Cr and Nb between liquid Fe metal (with low S and C content) and silicate melt. Using information from the steelmaking literature to correct for interactions in the metal phase, we find that, for peridotitic silicate melts, metal–silicate partition coefficients are given by: log D Nb met/sil = 2.5 log D Fe met/sil + 1.57 - 11 , 930 T - 114 ( ± 43 ) P T ± 0.41 log D V met/sil = 1.5 log D Fe met/sil + 0.582 - 6493 T - 62 ( ± 19 ) P T ± 0.08 log D Cr met/sil = log D Fe met/sil + 0.643 - 4232 ( ± 538 ) T - 22 ( ± 13 ) P T where D i met/sil is the partition coefficient for element i. Partitioning of V and Cr is insensitive to silicate melt composition, but Nb shows a considerable compositional effect. The new data enable us to examine different models of terrestrial accretion and core formation. If we fix the Fe content of the mantle at the current value and use the Ni content of the mantle to estimate pressure of equilibration then temperatures about 1200 °C above the silicate liquidus are required to match vanadium partitioning to the current concentration of V in the mantle. Under these conditions the core concentrations of Si (∼15{\%}) and Nb ({\textgreater}60{\%} of Earth's budget) are implausibly high. A more realistic approach is to assume that the metal of accreting planetesimals equilibrated at the base of a deep magma ocean whose temperature was close to the silicate liquidus. As the magma ocean deepened in proportion to the size of the Earth the metal was continuously extracted to the core without further re-equilibration in the lowermost mantle. In this case the V, Cr and Nb contents of core and mantle can easily reproduce the expected values provided the Earth became more oxidized as it accreted (O'Neill H. S. (1991) The origin of the Moon and the early history of the Earth—a chemical model. 2. The Earth Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 55(4), 1159–1172; Wade J. and Wood B. J.

(1988) Chemical-composition and accretion history of terrestrial planets. Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. A-Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 325(1587), 545–557). Increasing oxidation requires the oxidized Fe content of the mantle to increase from 0.5{\%} to 1.0{\%} to the current value of 6.26{\%} as the Earth grew. This model , with magma ocean thickness corresponding to 35{\%} of mantle depth, reproduces the calculated core–mantle partitioning of Ni, and Co and yields a Si content of the core of approximately 6{\%}, in good agreement with cosmochemical estimates.},

Clinopyroxeness, forsterite, perovskite, magnetitess, spinelss, hibonite and an unknown phase X are present at liquidus temperatures (ss: solid solution). At subsolidus temperatures the following phase assemblages were encountered; clinopyroxeness+perovskite, clinopyroxeness +perovskite+spinelss, clinopyroxeness +perovskite+melilite (+anorthite), clinopyroxeness +perovskite+melilite+spinelss+anorthite, clinopyroxeness +perovskite+anorthite+spinelss, and clinopyroxeness +perovskite+anorthite+hibonite. At subsolidus temperatures the single phase field of clinopyroxeness extends up to 19 wt.{\%} CaTiAl2O6. Even in the field of clinopyroxeness+perovskite, the TiO2 content in clinopyroxeness continues to increase and attains 9.2 wt.{\%} TiO2 with 24.8 wt.{\%} Al2O3. An interesting fact is that unusual clinopyroxenes which contain more AlIV than SiIV are present in the CaFe-AlSiO6-rich region. The liquid coexisting with pyroxene is richer in Ti, Al, and Fe3+ than the coexisting pyroxene. The clinopyroxenesss coexisting with liquid contain less TiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 than those crystallized at subsolidus temperatures. The petrological significance of the join and the crystallization of Ti- and Al-rich clinopyroxenes are discussed on the basis of the experimental results of the join.},

abstract = {Whole rock major and trace element abundances of the Horoman peridotites were used to understand processes forming lithological and compositional variations in the upper mantle. Similar to other orogenic peridotites, Horoman peridotites range from fertile lherzolites (3 to 4{\%} Al2O3 and CaO) to depleted harzburgites (∼0.5{\%} Al2O3 and CaO). Abundances of major oxides and compatible to moderately incompatible elements vary systematically with variations in MgO content. Such trends are commonly interpreted as indicating that the peridotites formed as residues from varying degrees of partial melting. The fertile end of these trends coincides with estimates of primitive mantle composition. Because of a mismatch between experimental melting trends for spinel peridotite, especially the Na2O-MgO trend, the compositional variations of Horoman peridotites are not consistent with formation as residues from partial melting of spinel peridotite. Non-linear trends in minor and trace element versus major element abundance diagrams also preclude a two-component mixing model. Recent melting experiments on garnet peridotite demonstrate that at 3 GPa the near-solidus peridotite has a large amount of subcalcic clinopyroxene (ca. 27{\%}) coexisting with small amount of garnet (ca. 2{\%}). Residues from polybaric melting of such garnet peridotite are consistent with the abundance variations of major and moderately incompatible elements, such as Na and heavy rare-earth elements, in the Horoman peridotites. A similar conclusion is applicable to other orogenic peridotites such as the Ronda peridotite because their major element compositional variations are similar to the Horoman peridotite.},

Many stratovolcanoes in the latter sector have precaldera lavas of basaltic composition and postcaldera lavas of dacitic composition (e.g. Quetrupill{\'{a}}n, Lan{\'{i}}n and Puyehue volcanoes). Hornblende is a common phenocryst phase in lavas of Provinces I and III (e.g. Marmolejo-San Jos{\'{e}} volcanic group and Mt. Burney volcano), but are uncommon in Recent lavas from Province II, particularly between 37–42°S (e.g. Antuco, Callaqui, Lonquimay, Villarrica, Puyehue, Osorno, Puntiagudo and Calbuco volcanoes). Nevados de Chill{\'{a}}n (36°50′S) located near the boundary of Provinces I and II is transitional, with lavas of andesitic composition lacking hornblende. Lavas from Province II generally have relatively flat chondrite-normalized REE patterns with low La/Sm ratios and HREE contents greater than 8 × chondrites; lavas from Province I have variable La/Yb ratios with HREE ranging from about 15 × chondrites to less than 5 × chondrites. Most samples from stratovolcanoes such as Puyehue and Nevados de Chill{\'{a}}n, have very subparallel REE patterns; other volcanic suites have REE patterns of varying slope with poor correlations of La/Sm, La/Yb and total REE with major elements, especially SiO2 content. Miocene volcanism in the SVZ is represented by subvolcanic rocks of basaltic to dacitic composition distributed along the Longitudinal Depression (33–42°S) and High Andes Cordillera (33–38°S). Manifestations of Miocene igneous activity associated with porphyry copper deposits are also observed between 28–33°S where Quaternary volcanism is absent.},

abstract = {In this paper we have compiled water concentration data obtained from melt inclusion in minerals, mostly quartz and topaz, from granites and pegmatites. A small number of data come from analysis of natural glasses. About 4600 melt inclusions are from granites, and about 2100 melt inclusions are from pegmatites. Another 4159 values are from melt inclusions and glasses of rocks with more than 66{\%} (g/g) SiO2are added belonging to a recent compilation. The total of 10,859 melt inclusions provides a statistically significant basis from which to derive some conclusions. Generally, the water concentration in granite melt inclusion is {\textless}10{\%} (g/g) with three maxima at 4.0±1.3, 5.9±1.2, and 8.1±1.1{\%} (g/g) water. For pegmatites, a larger range of water contents was found: from 2 to more than 50{\%} (g/g) water with two distinct maxima at 10.5±8.1 and 26.2±14.3{\%} (g/g). We show that the great spread and the generally high water content of the pegmatite-forming melts (as sampled by melt inclusions) are the result of melt-melt immiscibility processes connected with the formation of conjugate melt fraction with contrasting physical and chemical characteristics, which have also a major influence on the element partitioning between such fractions. In this paper we also discuss viscosity as an important transport property of natural silicate melts, and we show that due to high primary water concentration in the pegmatite-forming melts their viscosity is very low over a wide range of temperatures. In the case of water-rich peralkaline melt fractions the viscosity can decrease still further. Together these suggest that liquidus undercooling as the major cause of pegmatite textures is redundant. Furthermore we demonstrate that the effect of boron, carbonates and bicarbonates on pegmatite melts, these two last mostly ignored in the past, have a large influence on the melt structure and they enable pegmatite formation in the absence of the usual discussed fluxing elements, such as F and P. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Basal ice motion is crucial to ice dynamics of ice sheets. The Weertman sliding model for basal sliding over bedrock obstacles proposes that sliding velocity is controlled by pressure melting and/or ductile flow, whichever is the fastest; it further assumes that stoss-side melting is limited by heat flow through the obstacle and ductile flow is controlled by Power Law Creep. These last two assumptions, it is argued here, are invalid if a substantial basal layer of temperate ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\~{}} {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}melt{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) ice is present. In that case, frictional melting results in excess basal meltwater and efficient water flow, leading to near-thermal equilibrium. Stoss-side melting is controlled by melt water production, heat advection by flowing meltwater to the next obstacle, and heat conduction through ice/rock over half the obstacle height. No heat flow through the obstacle is required. High temperature ice creep experiments have shown a sharp weakening of a factor 5{\&}ndash;10 close to {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}melt{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, implying breakdown of Power Law Creep and probably caused by a deformation-mechanism switch to grain boundary pressure melting.

abstract = {New technologies, particularly those designed to address environmental concerns, have created a great demand for the rare earth elements (REE), and focused considerable attention on the processes by which they are concentrated to economically exploitable levels in the Earth's crust. There is widespread agreement that hydrothermal fluids played an important role in the formation of the world's largest economic REE deposit, i.e. Bayan Obo, China. Until recently, many researchers have assumed that hydrothermal transport of the REE in fluorine-bearing ore-forming systems occurs mainly due to the formation of REE-fluoride complexes. Consequently, hydrothermal models for REE concentration have commonly involved depositional mechanisms based on saturation of the fluid with REE minerals due to destabilization of REE-fluoride complexes. Here, we demonstrate that these complexes are insignificant in REE transport, and that the above models are therefore flawed. The strong association of H+and F−as HF° and low solubility of REE-F solids greatly limit transport of the REE as fluoride complexes. However, this limitation does not apply to REE-chloride complexes. Because of this, the high concentration of Cl−in the ore fluids, and the relatively high stability of REE-chloride complexes, the latter can transport appreciable concentrations of REE at low pH. The limitation also does not apply to sulphate complexes and in some fluids, the concentration of sulphate may be sufficient to transport significant concentrations of REE as sulphate complexes, particularly at weakly acidic pH. This article proposes new models for hydrothermal REE deposition based on the transport of the REE as chloride and sulphate complexes. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Volcanic and intrusive rocks with geochemical signatures typical of modern continental or oceanic arcs areuncommonin the Archaean and the archetypal Archaean granite-greenstone dome-and-keel architecture has no modern analogue. Proposed Archaean ophiolites, Atlantic-style passive margins, overprinting thrust and fold belts, blueschists, ultra high-pressure rocks, paired metamorphic belts, orogenic andesites, and subduction-zone m{\'{e}}langes that typify Phanerozoic plate margins are rare to absent. Since there is little evidence for Archaean subduction zones, we consider Archaean arcs to be 'Snarks', imaginary constructs with no objective existence. Some Archaean folds and upper-mantle structures interpreted as evidence for regional thrusting may equally well have developed during horizontal extension of lowviscosity crust. Nonetheless, there are clearly many Archaean terrains exhibiting fabrics formed by bulk shortening and some cratons contain terranes with contrasting histories. Given the absence of evidence for Archaean subduction, what could be a plausible driving force for compression and terrane accretion? Cratonic mobilism in response to mantle convection currents offers a possible solution to this paradox. Once a proto-craton develops a deep high-viscosity mantle keel, it would become subject to pressure from mantle currents and could drift. Immature cratons or oceanic plateaux would not have a strong mantle keel and so would be static. So, contrary to conventional wisdom, we consider that Archaean cratons are not immobile nucleii along whose margins 'mobile belts' form by subduction-zone accretion. Instead, we propose that Archaean cratons were the active tectonic agents, accreting and subcreting basaltic plateaux, other proto-cratons, and heterogeneous mantle domains as they drifted. In this model, accreted terranes and structures indicating bulk shortening would be concentrated at the cratonic leading edge, with oblique and strike-slip shear zones at the sides, extension and possible seafloor-spreading in the lee, and major oblique-slip shear zones in the interior developed as a result of the imposed stress field. Overridden oceanic plateaux would be thrust (subcreted) deep enough to melt in the garnet field and generate syntectonic pulses of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG), contributing to craton growth and stabilization. {\textcopyright} 2012 and Elsevier BV.},

abstract = {The Triassic Saima alkaline complex on the Liaodong Peninsula, northeastern China, consists mainly of potassic phonolite, nepheline syenite, and sodic lujavrite. The lujavrite shows significant Zr-REE mineralization, which is present in the form of early magmatic, Zr-REE-enriched clinopyroxene (30{\%}–40{\%}), titanite (5{\%}), and loparite-(Ce), and late magmatic to hydrothermal wadeite, widespread eudialyte group minerals (5{\%}–10{\%}), and catapleiite. Ultimately, the fractionation of the alkaline magma leads to the crystallization of mosandrite and hezuolinite. Textural relations and compositional variation among the characteristic Zr-REE-bearing minerals record that both Zr and REEs were strongly incompatible in the sodic melt, but that Zr mineralization preceded REE mineralization. The main Zr-REE mineralization in the Saima lujavrite resulted from the high peralkalinity, Na/K ratio and HFSE content, low oxygen fugacity, and the intensive activity of water and volatiles of its evolving magma. The discontinuous and abrupt changes in melt composition and mineral assemblage from the potassic nepheline syenite of the complex to the sodic lujavrite suggest that their magma was derived from different episodes of magmatic activity with different physico-chemical characteristics, rather than from the continuous evolution of a single magmatic event.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous M{\'{e}}gantic intrusive complex of southern Qu{\'{e}}bec contains early noritic gabbrodiorites which represent cumulates from crustally contaminated hawaiite to syenite magmas. Whole rock and mineral chemistry, as well as textural evidence, indicate that post-cumulus recrystallization and reaction were important, and most of the amphibole and biotite are thought to have formed in this way. A younger plutonic quartz-syenite ringdyke may not be cogenetic with the gabbro-diorites sice it lacks orthopyroxene. It may, however, be cogenetic with basaltic to riebeckite granite dykes. Fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, aluminous clinopyroxene, and minor Ti-magnetite from critically undersaturated alkali basaltic magmas generated hawaiitic magmas. The development of quartzbearing mugearitic and syenitic residua from the hawaiites can best be modelled by fractionation of amphibole, plagioclase, olivine, oxides, and apatite. Attempts to model fractionation using observed phenocrysts (including clinopyroxene) were unsuccessful. Amphibole fractionation is interpreted to have taken place through a reaction with still-porous, higher-temperature cumulates on the walls of the magma chamber. The plutonic syenites probably represent alkali feldspar cumulates from the residual syenitic melts. Magnesian calc-alkaline lamprophyres exhibit olivine to phlogopite reaction textures, are enriched in Cr, Ni, K, Rb, Nb, Y, Zr, and Si relative to the basaltic dykes, yet have similar incompatible element ratios. Their relation to the basalts is problematical. The late biotite-granite core to the complex is identical to typical White Mountain granites and may have formed as an anatectic cap on rising, fractionating, mantlederived magmas.},

abstract = {The northern Ethiopian rift forms the third arm of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden triple junction, and marks the transition from continental rifting in the East African rift to incipient oceanic spreading in Afar. We determine the P- and S-wave velocity structure beneath the northern Ethiopian rift using independent tomographic inversion of P- and S-wave relative arrival-time residuals from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the Ethiopia Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE) passive experiment using the regularised non-linear least-squares inversion method of VanDecar. Our 79 broad-band instruments covered an area 250 × 350 km centred on the Boset magmatic segment ∼70 km SE of Addis Ababa in the centre of the northern Ethiopian rift. The study area encompasses several rift segments showing increasing degrees of extension and magmatic intrusion moving from south to north into the Afar depression. Analysis of relative arrival-time residuals shows that the rift flanks are asymmetric with arrivals associated with the southeastern Somalian Plate faster (∼0.65 s for the P waves; ∼2 s for the S waves) than the northwestern Nubian Plate. Our tomographic inversions image a 75 km wide tabular low-velocity zone ($\delta$VP≈−1.5 per cent, $\delta$VS≈−4 per cent) beneath the less-evolved southern part of the rift in the uppermost 200–250 km of the mantle. At depths of {\textgreater}100 km, north of 8.5°N, this low-velocity anomaly broadens laterally and appears to be connected to deeper low-velocity structures under the Afar depression. An off-rift low-velocity structure extending perpendicular to the rift axis correlates with the eastern limit of the E—W trending reactivated Precambrian Ambo—Guder fault zone that is delineated by Quaternary eruptive centres. Along axis, the low-velocity upwelling beneath the rift is segmented, with low-velocity material in the uppermost 100 km often offset to the side of the rift with the highest rift flank topography. Our observations from this magmatic rift zone, which is transitional between continental and oceanic rifting, do not support detachment fault models of lithospheric extension but instead point to strain accommodation via magma assisted rifting.},

abstract = {Subduction of oceanic crust generates chemical and lithological heterogeneities in the mantle. An outstanding question is the extent to which these heterogeneities contribute to subsequent magmas generated by mantle melting, but the answer differs depending on the geochemical behaviour of the elements under investigation: analyses of incompatible elements (those that preferentially concentrate into silicate melts) suggest that recycled oceanic crust is an important contributor, whereas analyses of compatible elements (those that concentrate in crystalline residues) generally suggest it is not. Recently, however, the concentrations of Mn and Ni[mdash]two elements of varying compatibility[mdash]in early-crystallizing olivines, have been used to infer that erupted magmas are mixtures of partial melts of olivine-rich mantle rocks (that is, peridotite) and of metasomatic pyroxene-rich mantle rocks (that is, pyroxenite) formed by interaction between partial melts of recycled oceanic crust and peridotite. Here, we test whether melting of peridotite alone can explain the observed trend in olivine compositions by combining new experimental data on the partitioning of Mn between olivine and silicate melt under conditions relevant to basalt petrogenesis with earlier results on Ni partitioning. We show that the observed olivine compositions are consistent with melts of fertile peridotite at various pressures[mdash]importantly, melts from metasomatic pyroxenites are not required. Thus, although recycled materials may well be present in the mantle source regions of some basalts, the Mn and Ni data can be explained without such a contribution. Furthermore, the success of modelling the Mn-Ni contents of olivine phenocrysts as low-pressure crystallization products of partial melts of peridotite over a range of pressures implies a simple new approach for constraining depths of mantle melting.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the available information on the geology, mineralogy, and resources of the significant rare earth element (REE) deposits and occurrences in the Murmansk Region, northwest Russia. The region has one of the largest endowments of REE in the world, primarily the light REE (LREE); however, most of the deposits are of potential economic interest for the REE, only as by-products of other mining activity, because of the relatively low REE grade. The measured and indicated REE2O3 resources of all deposits in the region total 22.4, and 36.2 million tonnes, respectively. The most important resources occur in (1) the currently mined Khibiny titanite-apatite deposits, and (2) the Lovozero loparite-eudialyte deposit. The Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit is a potentially important resource of scandium. These deposits all have polymetallic ores, i.e., REE would be a by-product of P, Ti, and Al mining at Khibiny, Fe, Zr, Ta, and Nb mining at Lovozero, and Fe and Ti mining at Afrikanda. The Keivy block has potential for heavy REE exploitation in the peralkaline granite-hosted Yumperuaiv and Large Pedestal Zr-REE deposits and the nepheline syenite-hosted Sakharyok Zr-REE deposit. With the exception of the Afrikanda perovskite-magnetite deposit (LREE in perovskite) and the Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit (scandium in baddelyite), carbonatite-bearing complexes of the Murmansk Region appear to have limited potential for REE by-products. The sound transport, energy, and mining infrastructure of the region are important factors that will help ensure future production of the REE.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic Monteregian alkaline province of southern Quebec includes mafic aln{\"{o}}ite, monchiquite, basanite, camptonite, and alkali basalt dykes. Most carry phenocrysts of clinopyroxene that generally zone towards Ti–AlIV–Fe–Mn-rich and Mg–AlVI–Cr-poor rims. The zoning can best be explained through polybaric crystallization and differentiation during ascent from the upper mantle. In intermediate and leucocratic dykes, clinopyroxene AlIV–Ti contents decrease with the Mg/(Mg + $\Sigma$Fe) ratio, probably reflecting concurrent fractionation of a Ti-rich phase. Pyroxene phenocrysts in Monteregian mafic dykes commonly have green clinopyroxene cores that are richer in Na and Fe and poorer in Mg and Cr than the enclosing titansalite phenocrysts. Some cores are euhedral and sector zoned, implying crystallization from a melt more evolved than their present hosts. The high AlVI contents of these cores imply high pressures of crystallization. The abundance of crustal xenoliths and evolved pyroxene cores indicates that the host magmas hybridized with felsic melts, cumulates, or metasomatites within the crust or an anomalously Fe–Na-rich upper mantle. This implies that the host dykes are not primary magmas but hybrids. Consequently, dyke chemistry cannot simply be inverted to determine the composition and mineralogy of the mantle source.},

abstract = {The rate of CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion in plagioclase feldspar was determined under 1 atm anhydrous conditions over the temperature range 1400° to 1000°C in calcic plagioclase (An80-81) by homogenizing coherent exsolution lamellae. The dependence of the average interdiffusion coefficient on temperature is given by the expression: D ̃ = 10.99 (cm2/sec) exp(-123.4(kcal/mol)/RT), (T in °K). This value is for diffusion perpendicular to the (03 1̄) interface of the lamellae. CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than oxygen diffusion in the temperature range 1400° to 1200°C and possibly 10 orders of magnitude slower at subsolidus temperatures. The large differences in diffusion rates explain the apparent contradiction posed by the plagioclases of large layered intrusions (e.g., the Skaergaard), which retain delicate Ca, Na compositional zoning profiles on the micron scale, but have undergone complete oxygen isotopic exchange with heated meteoric groundwater from the surrounding wall rocks. CaAl-NaSi diffusion is slow, the closure temperature is high (within the solidus-liquidus interval), and Ca-Na zoning is preserved. Oxygen diffusion is faster, the closure temperature is lower (350°-400°C) and the feldspars exchange oxygen with the low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. The complex micron-scale oscillatory zones in plagioclase can also be used as cooling rate speedometers for volcanic and plutonic plagioclase. Cooling histories typical of large mafic intrusions (e.g. the Stillwater) are slow, begin at high initial temperatures (1200°C) and result in homogenization of oscillatory zones on the scale of 10 microns. The oscillatory zones found in the plagioclase of granodioritic plutons are preserved because cooling is initiated at a lower temperature (1000°C) limiting diffusion to submicron length scales despite the slow cooling rate of the intrusion. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

In a circa 1 km wide zone parallel to its contact with late Igdlerfigsalik, the South Q{\^{o}}roq centre shows recrystallisation and alteration of mafic phases. South Q{\^{o}}roq therefore comprises two zones, termed the “unaltered” and the “recrystallised” zones. A study of the biotites from the rocks of the area of the present study has demonstrated variations in biotite chemistry, notably variations in elements inferred to reside on the octahedral and hydroxyl sites. Samples were chosen to provide a representative selection from each centre, avoiding pegmatites and late-stage veins. Electron probe microanalyses demonstrate little Cl in these biotites. Fluorine contents of some biotites can be demonstrated to vary with Fe/(Fe+Mg) and ∑(octahedral Al and Ti). Statistical analysis of the data sets as a whole, however, does not demonstrate simple relationships between fluorine content and these parameters and more complex crystallographic controls over fluorine uptake are inferred. Despite these variations, the relative fluorine contents characteristic of each centre can be determined, which, it is believed, reflect the characteristic F activity of fluids associated with each period of magmatism. In South Q{\^{o}}roq, the unaltered zone has a distinctive F-content in biotite, reflecting the original F-content of fluids associated with South Q{\^{o}}roq magmatism. However in the recrystallised zone, the F-contents are distinct, more closely resembling F-contents characteristic of late Igdlerfigsalik rocks. Reaction between a fluorine-rich, younger fluid and older fluorine-poor rocks is inferred. Despite evidence in the micas for fluid-rock interaction, whole-rock chemical changes are irregular in nature and appear not to conform to simple trends. Mass-balance equations are therefore unable to predict the levels of fluid-rock interaction. Similar exchange between late-stage fluids from younger centres and pre-existing rocks may be commonplace in igneous plutonic environments, and fluorine in micas may provide a relatively sensitive guide to fluid-rock interactions.},

abstract = {High-resolution Fe K-edge XANES spectra of a series of crystalline Fe2+- and Fe3+-bearing model compounds were measured in an effort to correlate characteristics of the pre-edge feature with oxidation state and local coordination environment of Fe atoms. The model compounds comprise 30 natural minerals and synthetic compounds, with Fe coordination environments ranging from 4 to 12 O atoms for Fe2+, including 5-coordinated trigonal bipyramidal Fe2+, and from 4 to 6 O atoms for Fe3+. Most pre-edge spectra show two components (due to crystal-field splitting) that are located just above the Fermi level.$\backslash$nThe most useful characteristics of the Fe-K pre-edge for determining Fe oxidation state and coordination number are the position of its centroid and its integrated intensity. The separation between the average pre-edge centroid positions for Fe2+ and Fe3+ is 1.4 ± 0.1 eV. Thus, the position of the pre-edge feature can be used as a measure of the average Fe-redox state, with the average pre-edge position for mixed Fe2+-Fe3+ compounds occurring between positions for Fe2+ and Fe3+. The lowest pre-edge normalized heights and integrated intensities are observed for the most centrosymmetric sites of Fe, in agreement with previous studies (see Waychunas et al. 1983). Examination of the pre-edge features of mechanical mixtures of phases containing different proportions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ suggests that the pre-edge position and intensity for these mixtures can vary quite non-linearly with the average redox state of Fe. However, distinctly different trends of pre-edge position vs. pre-edge intensity can be observed, depending on the coordination environment of Fe2+ and Fe3+, with an accuracy in redox determination of ±10 mol{\%} provided that the site geometry for each redox state is known. These methods have been used to estimate the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in 12 minerals (magnetite, vesuvianite, franklinite, rhodonite, etc.) containing variable/unknown amounts of Fe2+/Fe3+.},

abstract = {Six crystalline mixtures, picrite, olivine-rich tholeiite, nepheline basanite, alkali picrite, olivine-rich basanite, and olivine-rich alkali basalt were recrystallized at pressures to 40 kb, and the phase equilibria and sequences of phases in natural basaltic and peridotitic rocks were investigated. The picrite was recrystallized along the solidus to the assemblages (1) olivine+orthopyroxene+ clinopyroxene +plagioclase+spinel below 13 kb, (2) olivine+orthopyroxene+clinopyroxene+spinel between 13 kb and 18 kb, (3) olivine+orthopyroxene+clinopyroxene+ garnet+spinel between 18 kb and 26 kb, and (4) olivine+clinopyroxene+garnet above 26 kb. The solidus temperature at 1 atm is slightly below 1,100° and rises to 1,320° at 20 kb and 1,570° at 40 kb. Olivine is the primary phase crystallizing from the melt at all pressures to 40 kb. The olivine-rich tholeiite was recrystallized along the solidus into the assemblages (1) olivine+ clinopyroxene+plagioclase+spinel below 13 kb, (2) clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+ spinel between 13 kb and 18 kb, (3) clinopyroxene+garnet+spinel above 18 kb. The solidus temperature is slightly below 1,100° at 1 atm, 1,370° at 20 kb, and 1,590° at 40 kb. The primary phase is olivine below 20 kb but is orthopyroxene at 40 kb. In the nepheline basanite, olivine is the primary phase below 14 kb, but clinopyroxene is the first phase to appear above 14 kb. In the alkali-picrite the primary phase is olivine to 40 kb. In the olivine-rich basanite, olivine is the primary phase below 35 kb and garnet is the primary phase above 35 kb. In the olivine-rich alkali basalt the primary phase is olivine below 20 kb and is garnet at 40 kb. Mineral assemblages in a granite-basalt-peridotite join are summarized according to reported experimental data on natural rocks. The solidus of mafic rock is approximately given by T=12.5 P Kb+1,050°. With increasing pressure along the solidus, olivine disappears by reaction with plagioclase at 9 kb in mafic rocks and plagioclase disappears by reaction with olivine at 13 kb in ultramafic rocks. Plagioclase disappears at around 22 kb in mafic rocks, but it persists to higher pressure in acidic rocks. Garnet appears at somewhat above 18 kb in acidic rocks, at 17 kb in mafic rocks, and at 22 kb in ultramafic rocks. The subsolidus equilibrium curves of the reactions are extrapolated according to equilibrium curves of related reactions in simple systems. The pyroxene-hornfels and sanidinite facies is the lowest pressure mineral facies. The pyroxene-granulite facies is an intermediate low pressure mineral facies in which olivine and plagioclase are incompatible and garnet is absent in mafic rocks. The low pressure boundary is at 7.5 kb at 750° C and at 9.5 kb at 1,150° C. The high pressure boundary is 8.0 kb at 750° C and 15.0 kb at 1,150° C. The garnet-granulite facies is an intermediate high pressure facies and is characterized by coexisting garnet and plagioclase in mafic rocks. The upper boundary is at 10.3 kb at 750° C and 18.0 kb at 1,150° C. The eclogite facies is the highest pressure mineral facies, in which jadeite-rich clinopyroxene is stable. Compositions of minerals in natural rocks of the granulite facies and the eclogite facies are considered. Clinopyroxenes in the granulite-facies rocks have smaller jadeite-Tschermak's molecule ratios and higher amounts of Tschermak's molecule than clinopyroxenes in the eclogite-facies rocks. The distribution coefficients of Mg between orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene are normally in the range of 0.5–0.6 in metamorphic rocks in the granulite facies. The distribution coefficients of Mg between garnet and clinopyroxene suggest increasing crystallization temperature of the rocks in the following order: eclogite in glaucophane schist, eclogite and granulite in gneissic terrain, garnet peridotite, and peridotite nodules in kimberlite. Temperatures near the bottom of the crust in orogenic zones characterized by kyanitesillimanite metamorpbism are estimated from the mineral assemblages of metamorphic rocks in Precambrian shields to be about 700° C at 7 kb and 800° C at 9 kb, although heat-flow data suggest that the bottom of Precambrian shield areas is about 400° C and the eclogite facies is stable. The composition of liquid which is in equilibrium with peridotite is estimated to be close to tholeiite basalt at the surface pressure and to be picrite at around 30 kb. The liquid composition becomes poorer in normative olivine with decreasing pressure and temperature. During crystallization at high pressure, olivine and orthopyroxene react with liquid to form clinopyroxene, and a discontinuous reaction series, olivine → orthopyroxene → clinopyroxene is suggested. By fractional crystallization of pyroxenes the liquid will become poorer in SiO2. Therefore, if liquid formed by partial melting of peridotite in the mantle slowly rises maintaining equilibrium with the surrounding peridotite, the liquid will become poorer in MgO by crystallization of olivine, and tholeiite basalt magma will arrive at the surface. On the other hand, if the liquid undergoes fractional crystallization in the mantle, the liquid may change in composition to alkali-basalt magma and alkali-basalt volcanism may be seen at a late stage of volcanic activity.},

abstract = {We propose a long-term volcanic hazards event tree for Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, two complex alkaline composite volcanoes that have erupted 1.8-3 km3 of mafic and felsic magmas from different vent sites during the last 35 ka. This is the maximum period that can be investigated from surface geology and also represents an upper time limit for the appearance of the first phonolites on that volcano. The whole process of the event tree construction was divided into three stages. The first stage included the determination of the spatial probability of vent opening for basaltic and phonolitic eruptions, based on the available geological and geophysical data. The second, involved the analysis of the different eruption types that have characterised the volcanic activity from Teide during this period. The third stage focussed on the generation of the event tree from the information obtained in the two previous steps and from the application of a probabilistic analysis on the occurrence of each possible eruption type. As for other volcanoes, the structure of the Teide-Pico Viejo Event Tree was subdivided into several steps of eruptive progression from general to more specific events. The precursory phase was assumed as an unrest episode of any geologic origin (magmatic, hydrothermal or tectonic), which could be responsible for a clear increase of volcanic activity revealed by geophysical and geochemical monitoring. According to the present characteristics of Teide-Pico Viejo and their past history, we started by considering whether the unrest episode would lead to a sector collapse or not. If the sector collapse does not occur but an eruption is expected, this could be either from the central vents or from any of the volcanoes' flanks. In any of these cases, there are several possibilities according to what has been observed in the period considered in our study. In the case that a sector collapse occurs and is followed by an eruption we considered it as a flank eruption. We conducted an experts elicitation judgement to assign probabilities to the different possibilities indicated in the event tree. We assumed long term estimations based on existing geological and historical data for the last 35 Ka, which gave us a minimum estimate as the geological record for such a long period is incomplete. However, to estimate probabilities for a short term forecast, for example during an unrest episode, we would need to include in the event tree additional information from the monitoring networks, as any possible precursors that may be identified could tell us in which direction the system will evolve. Therefore, we propose to develop future versions of the event tree to include also the precursors that might be expected on each path during the initial stages of a new eruptive event. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Associated with the Cretaceous Okorusu carbonatite complex (Namibia) is a hydrothermal fluorite mineralization hosted in Pan-African country rock marbles, which resulted from fluid-rock reaction between the marbles and orthomagmatic, carbonatitic fluids expelled from the carbonatite. Yellow fluorite I was deposited in veins up to 5 cm away from the wallrock contact, followed by purple and colorless fluorite II, smoky quartz and barite, a Mn-rich crust on early calcite, and pure calcite. This clear-cut sequence of mineral growth allows an investigation into fluid-rock interaction processes between the marble and the migrating carbonatitic fluid, and element fractionation patterns between the fluid and subsequent hydrothermal precipitates. Fluorite I shows a progressive change in color from dark yellow to colorless with purple laminations over time of deposition. Subsequent fluorite I precipitates show an increase in Ca, and a continuous decrease in F, Sr, REE, Y, Th, U and Pb contents. The ratios (Eu/Eu*)cn, Th/Pb and U/Pb increase whereas Y/Ho, Th/U and (La/Yb)cndecrease. The Sr-isotopic composition remains constant at87Sr/86Sr = 0.70456-0.70459, but with varying, highly radiogenic Pb (206Pb/204Pb = 32-190,238U/204Pb = 7-63). Fluorite II has87Sr/86Sr = 0.70454-0.70459,206Pb/204Pb = 18.349, and207Pb/204Pb = 15.600, and a chemical composition similar to youngest fluorite I. The Mn-rich crust on early calcite accumulated REE, Ba, Pb, Zr, Cs, Th and U, developing into pure calcite with a prominent negative Ce anomaly and successively more radiogenic Sr. The calculated degrees of fluid-rock interaction, f = weight fraction of fluid/(fluid + marble), decrease from fluorite I and most fluorite II (f = 0.5) to calcite (f = 0.2-0.3) and hydrothermal quartz (f ≪ 0.1). A crush-leach experiment for fluid inclusions in the hydrothermal quartz yielded a Rb-Sr isochron age of 103 ± 12 Ma. Crush-leach analysis for the carbonatitic fluid trapped in the wallrock yielded a trend from the fluid leachate to the host quartz (206Pb/204Pb = 18.224 and 18.602,207Pb/204Pb = 15.616 and 15.636, respectively) extending from carbonatite towards crustal rocks.Calculated trace element distribution coefficients fluorite/fluid are below unity throughout, and increase from La to Yb. Elements largely excluded from fluorite (Ba, Pb, LREE relative to HREE) were incorporated later into the Mn-rich crust on calcite. The trace element patterns of the hydrothermal minerals are related to changing aCO2and aF-in the fluid during continued fluid-marble reaction. A predominance of carbonate over fluoride complexing in the fluid as reactions proceeded controlled the Y/Ho, Th/U and REE patterns in the fluid and the crystallizing phases. Deviations from these trends indicate discontinuous processes of fluid-rock reaction. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Nechalacho rare-metal (REE-Y-Nb-Ta-Zr) deposit, is hosted by a sequence of altered, layered sodic syenites. Three distinct whole-rock chemical signatures are evident. Two of these signatures have high P, of which, one has high light REE (LREE) but low heavy REE (HREE) (type 1), and one has high HREE (type 2). The third signature has low P and high HREE, LREE and Zr (type 3). Type 1 and 2 signatures represent abundant monazite-(Ce) (LREEPO4) and xenotime-(Y) ((Y,HREE)PO4), respectively. Type 3 represents zircon and a variety of non- phosphate REE minerals, such as allanite-(Ce), fergusonite-(Y) ((Y,REE)NbO4), or bastnäsite- (Ce) (REECO3F). The results indicate that the ore mineralogy can in part be predicted from whole-rock chemistry. Phosphates are an important reservoir for the LREE at the Nechalacho deposit. Two main textural types of monazite-(Ce) have been recognized: columnar and equant. These can also be distinguished chemically based on U and Th concentrations. The columnar monazite-(Ce) is associated with an early magnetite-biotite-quartz alteration, whereas the equant monazite-(Ce) is associated with later carbonate-chlorite-fluorite alteration. Xenotime-(Y) also occurs in various habits, such as rods and anhedral aggregates. The deposit is divided into Upper and Basal zones, the Basal Zone having a higher HREE/LREE ratio than the Upper Zone. It has been previously proposed that the LREE were transported from magmatic eudialyte in the Basal Zone to higher in the system by hydrothermal fluids and precipitated there as LREE minerals. A recent geochemical model predicted that a series of pulses of aqueous fluid transporting REE, passing through a P-bearing nepheline syenite would precipitate monazite crystals that were progressively more depleted in HREE (relative to the starting fluid) with increasing distance from the source (height in the system). The REE chemistry of monazite from Nechalacho, obtained using LA-ICP-MS, does not support this model for the origin of LREE mineralization because the concentrations of HREE in monazite show no consistent decrease upward in the intrusive body, which suggests, along with the textural variability of the phosphates and their association with different assemblages, that the genesis of the LREE mineralization was caused by multi-stage alteration and its genesis is more complex than the proposed models imply. Fluid inclusion microthermometry on primary fluid inclusions in quartz and xenotime-(Y) indicate that the alteration fluids had salinities of {\~{}}8 to 13 wt.{\%} NaCl equivalent, and temperatures of {\~{}}240 to 590 °C, and were different from those that altered the nearby T Zone.},

abstract = {We report new Hf (and Nd) data for more than 100 sedimentary samples, recent to Archean in age, from a wide range of depositional environments. These data document the behavior of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopic systems in the global sedimentary system. In conjunction with existing data for mantle-derived rocks, we now have reasonable constraints on coupled Hf-Nd isotopic behavior in the crust and mantle. Lu/Hf and Hf isotopic compositions are strongly fractionated between muds and sands in passive margin sediments due to concentration of low Lu/Hf, low 176Hf/177Hf, Hf-rich zircons in mature sands. In active margin settings, Lu-Hf fractionation due to the 'zircon effect' is minor due to the less weathered and more juvenile character of the sediments. Nd isotopic compositions are not highly fractionated by sedimentary sorting because heavy minerals, also rich in REEs, do not fractionate Sm-Nd efficiently. The lack of a large and systematic fractionation at active margins means that no significant Hf-Nd decoupling occurs here. This is important because sediments at active margins are the most likely to be recycled to the mantle. Hf-Nd isotopic data for all terrestrial samples fall along a single coherent trend (??(Hf) = 1.36??(Nd) + 2.95) which we call the 'terrestrial array'. This array is composed of two complementary components: a mantle array (??(Hf) = 1.33??(Nd) + 3.19, defined by all oceanic basalts; and a crustal array (??(Hf) = 1.34??(Nd) + 2.82), defined by sediments, continental basalts, granitoids, and juvenile crustal rocks. The similarity of the crustal and mantle arrays indicates that no large-scale Hf-Nd decoupling occurs between the crust and mantle. The coherency of the terrestrial Hf-Nd array implies mixing within the mantle, due to stirring processes, and also within the crust, due to homogenization by collective sedimentary processes. In addition, tight Hf-Nd covariation may also imply that efficient crust to mantle recycling has modulated isotopic correlation in the silicate Earth. All Hf-Nd arrays, including the terrestrial array, lie significantly above (2-3 ??(Hf) units) the BSE (bulk silicate Earth) reference. This would appear to require a hidden reservoir in the Earth, heretofore unsampled, to balance the Hf-Nd isotopic composition of the terrestrial array. However, the discrepancy between the terrestrial array and BSE may simply be due to differences in the way the CHUR (chondritic uniform reference) values were determined for the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systems.},

abstract = {Collapse calderas can be attributed to subsidence of the magma chamber roof along bounding sub-vertical normal faults (ring-faults) after a decompression of the magma chamber. It has previously been shown that for ring-faults to initiate, and thus facilitate collapse, the stress field both at the surface and around the magma chamber must satisfy specific critical conditions. Here, we present new numerical models that use a Finite Element Method to investigate the effects of crustal layering on local stress field distribution. Results are compared with existing criteria for ring-fault initiation. Different subsurface scenarios were simulated by varying the stiffness (Young's modulus) of layers placed above the magma chamber, and the host rock in which the chamber is seated. We consider depressurisation of a magma chamber, so as to simulate magma withdrawal. Results indicate that mechanical layering is a further first-order variable in the rare achievement of stress conditions required for ring-fault formation, and may be influential in facilitating or inhibiting caldera collapse. We show that for a given geometrical set-up, the magnitude and position of maximum tensional stress at the Earth's surface are influenced by the occurrence and relative distribution of mechanically stiff or soft lithologies above the magma chamber. For example, tensional stress at surface may be reduced by the presence of stiff layers (e.g. lavas), or increased by soft layers (e.g. pyroclastic units) compared to generic simulations using a homogeneous background medium. Overall we find that the presence of mechanically soft material promotes surface fracture initiation. In addition we suggest that the position of peak tensional stress at surface derived by the numerical models does not represent that related to the position of the bounding ring-fault, but is instead related to the position of initial tensional fractures appearing prior to the collapse faults.},

abstract = {The formation of ore deposits of the platinum-group elements (PGE) requires that their concentrations be raised about four orders of magnitude above typical continental crustal abundances. Such extreme enrichment relies principally on the extraction capacity of sulfide liquid, which sequesters the PGE from silicate magmas. Specific aspects of PGE ore formation are still highly controversial, however, including the role of hydrothermal fluids. The majority of the world's PGE reserves are held in a handful of deposits, most of which occur within the unique Bushveld Complex of South Africa.},

abstract = {Using the U-Pb geochronology of zircon we can understand the growth and collapse of mountain chains, both recent and ancient. In the high-temperature metamorphic rocks that underlie mountain ranges, zircon may survive from precursor rocks, recrystallize, or grow anew. All these possibilities must be considered in the interpretation of zircon ages. Microtextural characterisation and microanalysis, coupled with considerations of mineral equilibria and trace element distributions between zircon and neighbouring silicate minerals, provide insights into the factors controlling zircon modification and growth. Zircon ages do not usually correspond to the peak of metamorphism but instead provide information on the history of cooling from high temperatures, including the timing and rates of exhumation of the deep roots of mountain chains.},

abstract = {The volatilization of fluorine from three melts in the system Na2OAl2O3SiO2 has been investigated at 1 atm pressure and 1200-1400°C. The melts chosen have base compositions corresponding to albite, jadeite and a peraluminous melt with 75 mole {\%} SiO2. Melt spheres were suspended from platinum loops in a vertical tube furnace in a flow of oxygen gas, then quenched, sectioned and analysed by electron microprobe. The microprobe scans indicate that transport of fluorine to the melt-vapor interface is by binary, concentration-independent interdiffusion of fluorine and oxygen. FO interdiffusivity increases in the order albite {\textless} peraluminous {\textless} jadeite. There is no simple reciprocal relationship between FO interdiffusivity and melt viscosity. Comparison with data on high-pressure interdiffusivity of fluorine and oxygen in jadeite melt indicates that FO interdiffusivity increases with pressure from 0.001 to 10 kbar while the activation energy remains unchanged. Fluorine chemical diffusivity in albite melt is substantially lower than H2O chemical diffusivity in obsidian melts suggesting that different diffusive mechanisms are responsible for the transport of F and H2O in igneous melts. Fluorine diffuses in albite melt via an anionic exchange with oxygen whereas water probably diffuses in obsidian melt via an alkali exchange mechanism. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

The crystallization of zircon is late in the consolidation of basaltic magma, early in that of dioritic or granitic magma, but increasingly delayed in alkaline magmas, apparently in keeping with the rank of the rocks in the alkaline series. In magmatic plutons in which zircon crystallized early, the characters and size of the zircons remain the same throughout. Zircon measurements can thus be used to fingerprint igneous rocks."},

abstract = {Baerzhe Be–Nb–Zr–REE deposit is hosted in alkaline granite (125 Ma) which intrudes in the late Jurassic Baiyingaolao Formation in the middle of the Great Hinggan Metallogenic Belt in China. The ore-forming granite consists of three lithological facies: arfvedsonite-bearing alkaline granite at the bottom, aegirine-bearing albite aplite in the middle and pegmatite crust on the top. The albite aplite is the main orebody. We recognized three magmatic-hydrothermal stages: orthomagmatic stage, late-magmatic stage and hydrothermal stage, with the late-magmatic stage being divided into two substages, the pegmatite substage and the aplite substage. Petrographic study on the granite, the microthermometric study on fluid inclusions and in situ laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis for quartz-hosted melt inclusions reveal the process of magmatic-hydrothermal evolution. The finding indicates that primary magma evolved to more peralkaline by fractional crystallization, with synchronously increasing high field strength elements. An extremely high content of Zr and Nb are in the melt inclusions from last stage albite aplite (Zr, min 52 548 ppm, and Nb, min 4104 ppm). This implies that the residual magma directly formed the orebody of rare metal elements. Meanwhile, volatility was increasing during the magma evolution process and F-bearing aqueous fluid was oversaturated at temperatures higher than 800°C. The separation of fluid from magma caused Li-REE enrichment in F-bearing fluid and depletion in residual melt, and led to the difference of the Y/Ho ratio between whole rock compositions and melt inclusion data. Fluid separated into a high-salinity liquid and a low density vapor phase above 697°C, and enriched REE in the high-salinity liquid. The oxygen isotope data shows mixing between primary magmatic-hydrothermal fluid and meteoric water. The ubiquitous pseudo-secondary fluid inclusions have a wide range of salinity below 462°C, which is similar to the melting temperatures of REE-bearing daughter minerals. A model involving the mixing by meteoric water could be a mechanism for precipitation of REE minerals.},

abstract = {New spark-source mass spectrometric analyses of Nb, Th, REE and other trace elements in Archaean to Tertiary komatiites and basalts were undertaken to test the model of Hofmann et al. [1] of secular variation of the composition of the upper mantle. Most 3.4 Ga komatiites and basalts have Nb/Th between 7 and 9, values that straddle the primitive mantle ratio of ∼ 8. Several 2.7 Ga komatiites also have Nb/Th= 7–9, but most samples of this age have higher Nb/Th, in the range 10–15. Cretaceous-Tertiary komatiites and basalts from Gorgona Island (Colombia) have Nb/Th between 11 and 24, values that approach those of modern oceanic basalts ( ∼ 15–34). Although these results generally support the model of Hofmann et al., there are several complicating factors: (1) most of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Gorgona komatiites have Nb/Th ratios little higher than those of 2.7 Ga komatiites and primitive mantle, which suggests that low Nb/Th may be a peculiarity of komatiites and not a feature of the Archaean mantle; (2) many Archaean komatiites are depleted in both Nb and Th relative to the REE, a feature that is inconsistent with their derivation from primitive mantle. We speculate that komatiites come from a source that evolved independently from normal upper mantle, and that the depletion of Nb and Th resulted from fractionation of an unknown phase during the deep melting. Certain tholeiitic basalts do not show unusual Nb-Th-La fractionation but nonetheless show a secular increase in Nb/Th. This variation may indicate a change in upper mantle compositions resulting from progressive withdrawal of continental crust during the past 3 Ga.},

abstract = {A 5.5 meter thick sill of fourchite near Montreal, Quebec, has several cumulate layers of titanaugite phenocrysts in its lower half and a corresponding number of zones of ocelli, small rounded bodies of feldspathic rock, in its upper half. Many of these ocelli coalesced to form thin, continous sheets which, being composed of less dense material than the surrounding fourchite, became unstable and developed small diapiric structures. From the distribution and shapes of the ocelli, and the spacing of the diapiric domes, it is calculated that the initial ocellar phase had a density of 2.1 gm/cm3, an interfacial tension with respect to the fourchite magma of less than 9 dynes/cm and a viscosity considerably greater than 3 poises. These properties indicate that these ocelli originated as droplets of immiscible feldspathic liquid that separated from a basic, alkaline magma, and rule out the other prevalent hypothesis that they are formed by the filling of gas cavities with residual magma.},

abstract = {We investigate the crustal structure and tectonic evolution of the North American continent in Alaska, where the continent has grown through magmatism, accretion, and tectonic under-plating. In the 1980s and early 1990s, we conducted a geological and geophysical investigation, known as the Trans-Alaska Crustal Transect (TACT), along a 1350-km-long corridor from the Aleutian Trench to the Arctic coast. The most distinctive crustal structures and the deepest Moho along the transect are located near the Pacific and Arctic margins. Near the Pacific margin, we infer a stack of tectonically underplated oceanic layers interpreted as remnants of the extinct Kula (or Resurrection) plate. Continental Moho just north of this underplated stack is more than 55 km deep. Near the Arctic margin, the Brooks Range is underlain by large-scale duplex structures that overlie a tectonic wedge of North Slope crust and mantle. There, the Moho has been depressed to nearly 50 km depth. In contrast, the Moho of central Alaska is on average 32 km deep. In the Paleogene, tectonic underplating of Kula (or Resurrection) plate fragments overlapped in time with duplexing in the Brooks Range. Possible tectonic models linking these two regions include flat-slab subduction and an orogenic-float model. In the Neogene, the tectonics of the accreting Yakutat terrane have differed across a newly interpreted tear in the subducting Pacific oceanic lithosphere. East of the tear, Pacific oceanic lithosphere subducts steeply and alone beneath the Wrangell volcanoes, because the overlying Yakutat terrane has been left behind as underplated rocks beneath the rising St. Elias Range, in the coastal region. West of the tear, the Yakutat terrane and Pacific oceanic lithosphere subduct together at a gentle angle, and this thickened package inhibits volcanism.},

abstract = {Structural interaction between dissolved fluorine and silicate glass (25°C) and melt (to 1400°C) has been examined with 19F and 29Si MAS NMR and with Raman spectroscopy in the system Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 as a function of Al2O3 content. Approximately 3 mol.{\%} F calculated as NaF dissolved in these glasses and melts. From 19F NMR spectroscopy, four different fluoride complexes were identified. These are (1) Na-F complexes (NF), (2) Na-Al-F complexes with Al in 4-fold coordination (NAF), (3) Na-Al-F complexes with Al in 6-fold coordination with F (CF), and (4) Al-F complexes with Al in 6-fold, and possibly also 4-fold coordination (TF). The latter three types of complexes may be linked to the aluminosilicate network via Al-O-Si bridges. The abundance of sodium fluoride complexes (NF) decreases with increasing Al/(Al + Si) of the glasses and melts. The NF complexes were not detected in meta-aluminosilicate glasses and melts. The NAF, CF, and TF complexes coexist in peralkaline and meta-aluminosilicate glasses and melts. From 29Si-NMR spectra of glasses and Raman spectra of glasses and melts, the silicate structure of Al-free and Al-poor compositions becomes polymerized by dissolution of F because NF complexes scavenge network-modifying Na from the silicate. Solution of F in Al-rich peralkaline and meta-aluminous glasses and melts results in Al-F bonding and aluminosilicate depolymerization. Temperature (above that of the glass transition) affects the Qn-speciation reaction in the melts, 2Q3 ⇔ Q4 + Q2, in a manner similar to other alkali silicate and alkali aluminosilicate melts. Dissolved F at the concentration level used in this study does not affect the temperature-dependence of this speciation reaction.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous M{\'{e}}gantic intrusive complex of southern Qu{\'{e}}bec contains early noritic gabbrodiorites which represent cumulates from crustally contaminated hawaiite to syenite magmas. Whole rock and mineral chemistry, as well as textural evidence, indicate that post-cumulus recrystallization and reaction were important, and most of the amphibole and biotite are thought to have formed in this way. A younger plutonic quartz-syenite ringdyke may not be cogenetic with the gabbro-diorites sice it lacks orthopyroxene. It may, however, be cogenetic with basaltic to riebeckite granite dykes. Fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, aluminous clinopyroxene, and minor Ti-magnetite from critically undersaturated alkali basaltic magmas generated hawaiitic magmas. The development of quartzbearing mugearitic and syenitic residua from the hawaiites can best be modelled by fractionation of amphibole, plagioclase, olivine, oxides, and apatite. Attempts to model fractionation using observed phenocrysts (including clinopyroxene) were unsuccessful. Amphibole fractionation is interpreted to have taken place through a reaction with still-porous, higher-temperature cumulates on the walls of the magma chamber. The plutonic syenites probably represent alkali feldspar cumulates from the residual syenitic melts. Magnesian calc-alkaline lamprophyres exhibit olivine to phlogopite reaction textures, are enriched in Cr, Ni, K, Rb, Nb, Y, Zr, and Si relative to the basaltic dykes, yet have similar incompatible element ratios. Their relation to the basalts is problematical.

abstract = {The Emeishan flood basalt is a large igneous province erupted during the Permian–Triassic period in southwestern China. Based on petrographic, major and trace element, and Sr–Nd isotope data, the Emeishan basalts can be classified into two major magma types. These are: (1) a low-Ti (LT) type that exhibits low Ti/Y ({\textless}500), Fe2O3* ({\textless}12{\%}), Nb/La (0.6–1.4), $\epsilon$Nd(t) (−4.8 to +1.4) and relatively high SiO2 (48–53{\%}) and Mg{\#} (0.52–0.64); (2) a high-Ti (HT) type that has high Ti/Y ({\textgreater}500). The HT lavas can be further divided into three subtypes. HT1 lavas exhibit significantly high TiO2 (3.65–4.7{\%}), Fe2O3* (12.7–16.4{\%}), Nb/La (0.75–1.1), coupled with higher $\epsilon$Nd(t) (1.1–4.8) and lower SiO2 (45–51{\%}); HT2 lavas are compositionally similar to the HT1 lavas but show conspicuous depletion in U and Th. The HT3 type has higher Mg{\#} (0.51–0.61) than the HT1 and HT2 lavas. It differs from the LT type in having higher TiO2 (∼3{\%}) at comparable Mg{\#}. Elemental and isotopic data suggest that the chemical variations of the LT and HT lavas cannot be explained by crystallization from a common parental magma. Instead, they may originate from different mantle sources under various melting conditions and underwent distinct differentiation and contamination processes. REE inversion calculations indicate that the HT magmas were generated by low degrees of partial melting (1.5{\%}) of a mantle source that has $\epsilon$Nd(t) of ∼+5 and 87Sr/86Sr(t) of ∼0.704 within the garnet stability field. These magmas were then subjected to shallow level gabbroic fractionation, which led to larger chemical variations. In contrast, parental magmas of the LT type were generated by higher degree of partial melting (16{\%}) of a distinct mantle source ($\epsilon$Nd(t)≈+2, 87Sr/86Sr(t)≈0.705) around the spinel–garnet transition zone. The chemical evolution of the LT lavas is controlled by an olivine (ol)+clinopyroxene (cpx) fractionation. The Emeishan flood basalts may result from a starting mantle plume. The petrogenesis of both the LT and HT magmas was further complicated by contamination of upper crust and lithospheric mantle. While the HT1 lavas have experienced an AFC style of contamination in the upper crust, the HT2 lavas that mark with U–Th depletions may result from additional interaction with melts derived from a gabbroic layer near the crust–mantle boundary. In contrast, a temperature-controlled style of contamination was associated with the LT lavas. Our data show that both temporal and spatial geochemical variations exist in the Emeishan flood basalt province. The occurrence of thick LT lavas in the western part of the province may record the main episode of the flood basalt emplacement. In contrast, the less abundant overlying HT basalts may imply a waning activity of the plume. In fact, the HT basalts are the dominant magma type in the periphery of the province. The lower degrees of mantle melting of the HT lavas may be a result of relatively thicker lithosphere and lower geotherm.},

abstract = {Three thin, syn-caldera ash flow tuffs of the Suswa volcano, Kenya, contain pumiceous clasts and globules of trachytic glass, and clasts rich in carbonate globules, in a carbonate ash matrix. Petrographic and textural evidence indicates that the carbonate was magmatic. The trachyte is metaluminous to mildly peralkaline and varies from nepheline- to quartz-normative. The carbonate is calcium-rich, with high REE and F contents. The silicate and carbonate fractions have similar 143Nd/144Nd values, suggesting a common parental magma. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns are consistent with a carbonate liquid being exsolved from a silicate liquid after alkali feldspar fractionation. Sr isotopic and REE data show that the carbonate matrix of even the freshest tuffs interacted to some degree with hydrothermal and/or meteoric water. A liquid immiscibility relationship between the trachyte and carbonate is indicated by the presence of sharp, curved menisci between them, the presence of carbonate globules in silicate glass and of fiamme rich in carbonate globules separated by silicate glass, and by the fact that similar phenocryst phases occur in both melts. It is inferred that the carbonate liquid separated from a carbonated trachyte magma prior to, or during, caldera collapse. Viscosity differences segregated the magma into a fraction comprising silicate magma with scattered carbonate globules, and a fraction comprising carbonate globules in a silicate magmatic host. Explosive disruption of the magma generated silicate-and carbonate-rich clasts in a carbonate matrix. The silicate liquid was disaggregated by explosive disruption and texturally appears to have been budding-off into the carbonate matrix. After emplacement, the basal parts of the flows welded slightly and flattened. The Suswa rocks represent a rare and clear example of a liquid immiscibility relationship between trachyte and carbonate melts.},

abstract = {We have determined major and trace elements and the Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotope systematics in minerals of 19 garnet peridotites from the Gibeon Townlands and Hanaus kimberlite pipes. These are situated within the mixed age Proterozoic to Archean (?) Rehoboth crustal province in Namibia. Our geothermobarometric results confirm previous results on the similarities of the conductive geothermal gradients underneath the Rehoboth province and the Kaapvaal craton and also that the Rehoboth mantle must have lost a significant proportion of its lithosphere. We distinguish peridotites with sinusoidal REE patterns similar as they commonly occur in the Archean Kaapvaal subcratonic mantle (named by us as $\sigma$ type peridotites) and peridotites with LREE depleted patterns typical for the Proterozoic (N type). Both types are reenriched restites of partial melting processes. Time constraints for these processes can be found from the Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotope systems and from published Re-Os data. The Lu-Hf isotope system dates an enrichment event of a highly depleted mantle ($\epsilon$Hf. =. +29.4) for the $\sigma$-peridotites at around 1.9. Ga. Enrichment for the N-peridotites occurred between 850 and 900. Ma ago in a slightly depleted mantle ($\epsilon$Hf. =. + 3.3). The last enrichment event at around 460. Ma may be recorded by the Sm-Nd system in the $\sigma$-peridotites. A published Re-Os isotope data set from the neighbouring Louwrensia pipe reports Re depletion ages up to 2.1. Ga (chondritic Re-Os Earth model) and Re model ages of 2.4. Ga. The latter ages agree with estimates for the timing of first partial melting for the $\sigma$ peridotites as deduced from the Lu-Hf isotope system combined with model calculations for partial melting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Hooper1993,
abstract = {New major and trace element data on over 70 samples are combined with a wider knowledge of the regional stratigraphy, and of the tectonic evolution of the boundary between the Columbia Plateau and the northern margin of the Basin and Range province, to distinguish three subgroups within the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG): the Picture Gorge Basalt; the main sequence of Columbia River flood basalts, here named the Clarkston Basalt; and the Saddle Mountains Basalt. The subgroups are characterized by different incompatible element and Sr-, Nd-, and Pb-isotope ratios, and they are interpreted in terms of different source regions mobilized under different tectonic conditions. The major differences between the subgroups are consistent with partial melting processes in the upper mantle, and it is argued that they reflect previous partial melting episodes which resulted in source regions that were variably enriched and depleted in incompatible elements. The major variations within the Picture Gorge and Clarkston Basalt subgroups include increases in the abundances of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and increases in the ratios of LILE/high field strength elements (HFSE) which are interpreted as the addition of a lithospheric/subduction-related component.
The Picture Gorge Basalt has a depleted isotopic and chemical signature on which is superimposed an enrichment of LILE to produce a trace element pattern similar to that of other 17–0-Ma basalts erupted south of the Olympic Wallowa Lineament. This pattern is characteristic of volcanism associated with the Basin and Range extensional province, and others have attributed it to a source component derived from an enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM).
Of the Clarkston Basalts, the Imnaha and Grande Ronde Basalts form chemical and isotopic arrays which indicate mixing of components from two distinct source regions. One had high ratios of LILE/HFSE and light rare earth elements (LREE)/HFSE, and as these are not common in oceanic basalts, this component is thought to have been derived from the continental mantle lithosphere. Its isotope ratios are more enriched (older?) than those of the Picture Gorge Basalt, and its Rb/Sr ratios are much higher than those in its source rocks, consistent with preferential mobilization of LILE at the time of magmatism. The second component was derived from an asthenospheric source similar to that of Hawaii basalts and is most obviously attributed to mantle plume activity. Basalts of the Eckler Mountain and Wanapum Formations (smaller, separate formations of the Clarkston Basalt as redefined in this paper) fit this mixing model less well and may represent mixing between more than two components. Flows of the third CRBG subgroup, the Saddle Mountains Basalt, also carry a lithospheric geochemical signature and have long been recognized as having more radiogenic isotopic signatures than the other two subgroups. Thus, Saddle Mountains flows appear to require a lithospheric source enriched in LILE at an even earlier time, and we concur with other workers that the isotopic and chemical evidence implies their derivation from subcontinental lithospheric mantle enriched at ˜2000 Ma.
Within each subgroup, the chemical effects of partial melting, fractional crystallization, and magma mixing processes can all be distinguished within particular flow sequences. In the Imnaha Basalt variable degrees of partial melting during the generation of the CRBG magmas, and gabbro fractionation within the lower crust, played major roles in their evolution. In the Grande Ronde Basalt fractional crystallization appears to be restricted to {\textgreater}10{\%}.
The chemical and isotopic data for each CRBG subgroup, and the different sources which those data imply, can be accommodated in a tectonic model which includes the passing of the Yellowstone hotspot south of the center of the CRBG eruption before significant Basin and Range extension had moved north of the Brothers Fault zone at 15 Ma.},

abstract = {The Late Proterozoic Damara Orogen (750-450 Ma) in Namibia forms part of the Pan-African mobile belt system which dissects southern Africa. The Khomas Trough in the inland branch of the orogen comprises thick multiply deformed metagreywackes and pelites of the Kuiseb Formation. Minor lithologies are graphite schists, calc-silicates and scapolite schists. The Matchless Amphibolite occurs structurally emplaced within the sequence and contains tholeiitic, mid-ocean ridge type metavolcanic rocks, including pillow lavas and breccias, as well as ultramafic lithologies and metagabbroic lenses. Pelagic graphite schists, pelitic schists and a marble unit are intercalated within the metabasic rocks. Original sedimentary structures, turbidite facies, the vertical facies distribution of progradational and retrogradational cycles, and the lateral extent of major sedi- mentary units indicate that psammitic parts of the sedimentary protoliths have been deposited as turbidites on an elongate submarine fan. Geochemical signatures suggest that an active continental margin source to the north-east of the present-day Khomas Trough supplied the vast amounts of clastic sediment. The regional structural pattern is characterized by five phases of deformation with folds verging consistently to the south-east. The structural regime is markedly heterogeneous and is associated with thrusting which developed elongate thrust slices traceable laterally for at least 150 kilometres. Metamorphic index minerals indicate lower to upper amphibolite facies conditions but partial melting occurred in some areas along the northern margin of the Khomas Trough. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} These features are explained in a tectono-sedimentary model which involves the evolution of a Late Proterozoic accretionary prism, here named the Khomas Hochland accretionary prism, within a convergent continental margin setting. Rift initiation took place along old tectonic weakness zones between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons. This was followed by the formation of oceanic crust in the Khomas Sea which was an appreciably sized oceanic basin with a width of hundreds of kilometres minimum. Subsequent convergence and north-west directed subduction of oceanic crust beneath the Congo Craton produced an oceanic trench which contained the westward prograding elongate submarine fan. Pelagic sedimentation occurred contemporaneously within the basin. Basalts including a high proportion of pillow lavas and associated massive sulphide ore deposits formed at the mid-ocean ridge. The accretionary prism evolved through the offscraping of the trench sediments together with some pelagics from the oceanic plate and the accretion against the Congo cratonic margin. Early folding and thrusting occurred within the prism during this accretionary stage. Continental collision of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons resulted in the formation of a northerly steepening thrust pile with an overall imbricate fan geometry. Subsequent phases of compressiohal deformation involved initially south-eastward directed thrusting and folding which was followed at a late stage by right-lateral strike-slip dislocation along the Okahandja Lineament. The Matchless Amphibolite has most probably been emplaced during the obduction of the accretionary prism onto the Kalahari Craton. Thermal relaxation subsequent to subduction led to a prolonged amphibolite facies regional metamorphism with the peak occurring late in the deformational history. Heterogeneous geothermal gradients in the Khomas Trough are interpreted to be due to differential uplift. The post-tectonic Donkerhoek Granite intruded along the Okahandja Lineament which is interpreted to represent the former backstop of the accretionary prism. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Lithologies, structural styles, time sequence of events and the size of the Khomas Hochland accretionary prism may be compared with the Palaeozoic Southern Uplands accretionary prism of Scot- land, the Cretaceous Chugach terrain in Alaska and the Shumagin region of the modern Aleutian Trench. Several aspects such as the inferred width of the Khomas Sea, the scarcity of arc magmatics to the north, the lack of recognition of fore-arc basin deposits, early compressional stresses, extensive sediment loading, and the intercalation of metabasalts, turbidites, pelagics and massive sulphide deposits all point to the shallow subduction of young, buoyant and hot oceanic crust. A comparison to the southern Peru - Chile Trench may be drawn.},

The use of a temperature-dependent thermal expansion and bulk modulus, and the use of high-pressure equations of state for solids and fluids, allows calculation of mineral–fluid equilibria to 100 kbar pressure or higher. A pressure-dependent Landau model for order–disorder permits extension of disordering transitions to high pressures, and, in particular, allows the alpha–beta quartz transition to be handled more satisfactorily. Several melt end-members have been included to enable calculation of simple phase equilibria and as a first stage in developing melt mixing models in NCKFMASH. The simple aqueous species density model has been extended to enable speciation calculations and mineral solubility determination involving minerals and aqueous species at high temperatures and pressures. The data set has also been improved by incorporation of many new phase equilibrium constraints, calorimetric studies and new measurements of molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility. This has led to a significant improvement in the level of agreement with the available experimental phase equilibria, and to greater flexibility in calculation of complex mineral equilibria. It is also shown that there is very good agreement between the data set and the most recent available calorimetric data.},

The LPS is unusual for a thin (c. 21 m), shallow, tholeiitic intrusion because it displays well-developed cumulate layering similar to that seen in large layered intrusions. The LPS has an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5{\%}) Lower Chilled Margin (LCM), a ({\textless}1 m thick) dendritic, olivine-phyric Lower Border Zone (LBZ), a (c. 7 m thick) olivine-dominated (up to c. 55{\%}) melagabbro–feldspathic-peridotite zone (OZ), a thin (c. 1 m) clinopyroxene-rich cumulate gabbro (CPZ) containing sector-zoned euhedral clinopyroxene, a (c. 10 m thick) doleritic gabbro zone (DZ), a ({\textless}1 m thick) aphyric, dendritic Upper Border Zone (UBZ) and an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5{\%}) Upper Chilled Margin (UCM). Distinct compositional groups recognized in olivines from the OZ can be associated with specific crystal morphologies, some showing significant reverse zoning. Melt compositions were calculated through application of the olivine–melt Fe = Mg exchange coefficient. The calculations suggest that phenocrystic and primocrystic olivine (Fo88–82) in the LCM–LBZ and lower OZ formed from melts with c. 13–10 wt {\%} MgO. Modeling implies that reversely zoned olivine primocrysts and chadacrysts have rims in equilibrium with melts of c. 10–8 wt {\%} MgO that were saturated only in olivine (+ minor chromite), whereas some olivine cores formed from melts as evolved as c. 6–5 wt {\%} MgO that would have coexisted with a gabbroic assemblage. The presence of multiple olivine populations in the OZ (some reverse zoned) indicates that the LPS did not crystallize from a single pulse of melt that evolved by closed-system fractional crystallization. We propose that the reverse zoning pattern records incorporation of evolved crystals, most derived from the mushy gabbroic host, when an olivine-charged replenishment under- or intraplated the partly crystallized basaltic magma, now preserved as the DZ. The intervening CPZ may also owe its origin to the emplacement of the olivine slurry, possibly as a result of pore-scale melt mixing at this interface. The DZ shows inward differentiation trends that can be explained by in situ differentiation. The data imply that late emplacement of olivine-rich crystal slurries and in situ differentiation both played a role in the development of the layered LPS.},

abstract = {Late Miocene–Pliocene volcanism on the Tenerife island consists of three different series (Teno, Roque del Conde and Anaga). These three series have distinct differences in isotopic compositions. Teno, the western massif, has the most radiogenic Nd and Pb isotopes and least radiogenic Sr ratios. Anaga, the easternmost massif, has the least radiogenic Nd and Pb, and most radiogenic Sr found in the island. Roque del Conde in the south has isotopic compositions between that of Teno and Anaga, similar to the younger volcanic series. All of the three late Miocene–Pliocene massifs have trace-element characteristics resembling those found in HIMU basalts, and there are only small variations between the different massifs. Variations in isotopic characteristics are attributed to two distinct mantle sources. One source appears to be a young HIMU source. The other source is an “enriched mantle source” with isotopic ratios broadly similar to an EM I source, but with lower 207Pb/204Pb to given 206Pb/204Pb. Assimilation during fractional crystallisation also seems evident. The younger basalts (Las Ca{\~{n}}adas, Dorsal and Historic) exhibit relatively homogeneous Nd and Pb isotopic compositions, but show considerable diversity in incompatible trace-element ratios. Fractional crystallisation in periodically refilled magma chambers and assimilation of syenite may have fractionated incompatible trace-element ratios to some degree, but the variations could also be caused by a different degree of partial melting, with the younger basalt generally derived from smaller degrees of partial melt than the older massifs.},

abstract = {We define the minimum viable metapopulation (MVM) size as the minimum number of interacting local populations necessary for long-term persistence of a metapopulation in a balance between local extinctions and recolonizations. The minimum amount of suitable habitat (MASH) is defined as the minimum density (or number) of suitable habitat patches necessary for metapopulation persistence. Levins's metapopulation model suggests that MASH can be estimated by the fraction of empty patches in a network in which the metapopulation occurs at a stochastic steady state. We discuss three reasons why this rule of thumb is likely to give an underestimate, and possibly a severe underestimate, of MASH: the rescue effect, colonization-extinction stochasticity, and nonequilibrium (transient) metapopulation dynamics. The assumption that metapopulations occur at a steady state, common to many models, may be frequently violated because of the high rate of habitat loss and fragmentation in many landscapes. Scores of rare and endangered species may already be ''living dead,'' committed to extinction because extinction is the equilibrium toward which their metapopulations are moving in the present fragmented landscapes. To conserve these species we should reverse the process of habitat loss and fragmentation.},

abstract = {This contribution addresses contact metamorphism and fluid flow in calcareous rocks of the Neoproterozoic Shaler Supergroup on Victoria Island, Arctic Canada. These processes occurred due to intrusion of gabbroic sills and dykes at c. 720 Ma during the Franklin magmatic event, which was associated with the break-up of Rodinia. The intrusive sheets (sills and dykes) are a few metres to ∼50 m thick. Metasedimentary rocks were examined in three locations with very good exposures of vertical dykes feeding horizontal sills, the North Feeder Dyke (NFD) complex, the South Feeder Dyke (SFD) complex, and the Uhuk Massif. In the NFD and SFD complexes, protoliths were limestones and dolostones with minor silicates, and at the Uhuk Massif, the protoliths were silty dolostones. At the time of magma emplacement, these locations were at depths of 1-4 km. The widths of contact aureoles are only several decametres wide, commensurate with thicknesses of the dykes and sills. Splays of tremolite mark incipient metamorphism. Highest-grade rocks in the NFD and SFD complexes contain the prograde assemblage diopside + phlogopite whereas at Uhuk they contain the assemblage vesuvianite + garnet + diopside. The assemblages are successfully modelled with T-X(CO2)fluid pseudosections that suggest achievement of CO2-rich fluid compositions due to early decarbonation reactions, followed by influx of aqueous fluids after peak metamorphism. Rapid heating of host rocks and short near-peak temperature intervals are demonstrated by the prevalent morphology of diopside as radial splays of acicular crystals that appear to pseudomorph tremolite and by incomplete recrystallization of calcite in marbles. Calc-silicates in the roof of one sill at Uhuk experienced metasomatic influx of Fe that is evidenced by nearly pure andradite rims on grossular garnet. Vesuvianite, which overgrew the grossular portions of garnet, also contains ferric iron. Vesuvianite was partially consumed during retrograde growth of serpentine and andradite. The occurrence of serpentine in high-grade portions of aureoles is consistent with eventual leveling-off of temperatures between 350 and 400° C, an inference that is supported by modelled conductive heat transfer from the cooling magma sheets.Focused fluid flow near intrusion-wall rock contacts is demonstrated by narrow zones of anomalously low $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values of carbonate minerals. Although the up to 5‰ decrease of both $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values from sedimentary values is much smaller than is typical for calc-silicate aureoles around large plutons, it is greater than what could have been achieved by decarbonation alone. The decrease in $\delta$13C is attributed to fluid-mediated exchange with organic low-13C carbon that is dispersed through the unmetamorphosed rocks and the decrease in $\delta$18O is attributed to fluid-mediated isotopic exchange with the gabbroic intrusive sheets. This study shows that when gabbroic sills and dykes intrude a sedimentary basin, 1) contact aureoles are likely to be narrow, only on the scale of several decametres, 2) short high-temperature regimes prevent achievement of equilibrium metamorphic textures, 3) T-X(CO2)fluid paths in calcareous contact aureoles are likely to be complex, reflecting a transition from prograde decarbonation reactions to influx of aqueous fluids during cooling.{\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

abstract = {The island of Pantelleria (Sicily Strait), the type locality for pantellerite, has been the locus of major caldera-forming eruptions that culminated, ca. 50 ka ago, in the formation of the Cinque Denti caldera produced by the Green Tuff eruption. The post-caldera silicic activity since that time has been mostly confined inside the caldera and consists of smaller-energy eruptions represented by more than twenty coalescing pantelleritic centers structurally controlled by resurgence and trapdoor faulting of the caldera floor. A high-resolution 40Ar/39Ar study was conducted on key units spanning the recent (post-20 ka) intracaldera activity to better characterize the present-day status (and forecast the short-term behavior of) the system based on the temporal evolution of the latest eruptions. The new 40Ar/39Ar data capture a long-term ({\textgreater} 15 ka) decline in eruption frequency with a shift in eruptive pace from 3.5 ka−1 to 0.8 ka−1 associated with a prominent paleosol horizon marking the only recognizable volcanic stasis around 12–14 ka. This shift in extraction frequency occurs without major changes in eruptive style, and is paralleled by a subtle trend of decreasing melt differentiation index. We speculate that this decline probably occurred (i) without short-term variations in melt production/differentiation rate in a steady-state compositionally-zoned silicic reservoir progressively tapped deeper through the sequence, and (ii) that it was possibly modulated by outboard eustatic forcing due to the 140 m sea level rise over the past 21 ka. The intracaldera system is experiencing a protracted stasis since 7 ka. Coupled with recent geodetic evidence of deflation and subsidence of the caldera floor, the system appears today to be on a wane with no temporal evidence for a short-term silicic eruption.},

abstract = {Abstract In the North China block, the south Liaodong Peninsula massif is an elliptical metamorphic core complex (MCC) with a long axis trending NESW. In crosssection view, it is asymmetric, with a steeply dipping northwestern flank and a gently dipping southeastern flank. It consists of three lithotectonic units: a gneissic migmatite unit, a Paleo to MesoProterozoic micaschistslate unit, and a Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary cover. Three deformation events related to extensional tectonics are distinguished in the study area: D1 is a ductile deformation related to the exhumation of the MCC; the following event, D2, corresponds to the development of recumbent folds formed during the early exhumation of the MCC; and the youngest event, D3, corresponds to brittle normal faulting that controlled the opening of a Cretaceous continental halfgraben basin. A preD1 event characterized as northward verging is interpreted as the result of NS shortening that occurred in the Late Triassic during the final stages of the collision between the North and South China blocks. The ductile and brittle structures were developed coevally, with synkinematic plutonism and formation of halfgrabens. New 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb Cretaceous ages obtained from the mylonitic granodiorite, gneissic migmatite, orthogneiss, and granite indicate that the south Liaodong Peninsula MCC is contemporaneous with other Cretaceous extensional structures, such as numerous syntectonic plutons bounded by ductile normal faults, MCC, and halfgraben basins, described in eastern China. Among the several hypotheses proposed to account for the Mesozoic extension along the eastern margin of Eurasia, lithosphere convective removal appears to be the most likely.},

abstract = {The concentrations of platinum-group elements (PGE), Co, Re, Au and Ag have been determined in the base-metal sulphide (BMS) of a section of the Merensky Reef. In addition we performed detailed image analysis of the platinum-group minerals (PGM). The aims of the study were to establish: (1) whether the BMS are the principal host of these elements; (2) whether individual elements preferentially partition into a specific BMS; (3) whether the concentration of the elements varies with stratigraphy or lithology; (4) what is the proportion of PGE hosted by PGM; (5) whether the PGM and the PGE found in BMS could account for the complete PGE budget of the whole-rocks. In all lithologies, most of the PGE (∼65 up to ∼85{\%}) are hosted by PGM (essentially Pt–Fe alloy, Pt–Pd sulphide, Pt–Pd bismuthotelluride). Lesser amounts of PGE occur in solid solution within the BMS. In most cases, the PGM occur at the contact between the BMS and silicates or oxides, or are included within the BMS. Pentlandite is the principal BMS host of all of the PGE, except Pt, and contains up to 600 ppm combined PGE. It is preferentially enriched in Pd, Rh and Co. Pyrrhotite contains, Rh, Os, Ir and Ru, but excludes both Pt and Pd. Chalcopyrite contains very little of the PGE, but does concentrate Ag and Cd. Platinum and Au do not partition into any of the BMS. Instead, they occur in the form of PGM and electrum. In the chromitite layers the whole-rock concentrations of all the PGE except Pd are enriched by a factor of five relative to S, Ni, Cu and Au. This enrichment could be attributed to BMS in these layers being richer in PGE than the BMS in the silicate layers. However, the PGE content in the BMS varies only slightly as a function of the stratigraphy. The BMS in the chromitites contain twice as much PGE as the BMS in the silicate rocks, but this is not sufficient to explain the strong enrichment of PGE in the chromitites. In the light of our results, we propose that the collection of the PGE occurred in two steps in the chromitites: some PGM formed before sulphide saturation during chromitite layer formation. The remaining PGE were collected by an immiscible sulphide liquid that percolated downward until it encountered the chromitite layers. In the silicate rocks, PGE were collected by only the sulphide liquid.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are commonly associated with breakup of continents, and therefore, are a critical source of information to constrain paleocontinental reconstructions. We review the record of LIPs emplaced during the 1600-700 Ma interval. Regional-scale magmatic events at 1460, 1380, and 1280 Ma can be associated with the breakup of the proposed late-Paleoproterozoic supercontinent, Nuna (Columbia), events at 1300-900 Ma overlap with the assembly of Rodinia, and events at 825, 800, 780, 755, and possibly 720 Ma, are associated with the breakup of Rodinia. Furthermore, the extensional events at 1000 and 900 Ma are associated with breakups suggesting simultaneous assembly and breakup of different parts of the supercontinent. The possibility of spatially separated (independent) LIPs having the same age complicates the use of LIPs to constrain specific aspects of reconstructions. This study identifies such spatially separated but coeval LIPs at 1460, 1380, 1270, and 1115-1070 Ma (and possibly at 825, 780, and 755 Ma). Regionally grouped LIPs, possibly representing superplume events, are recognized at 825-755 Ma, and at 1280-1235 Ma. The use of the LIP record to assist the reconstruction of Rodinia will improve as numerous remaining poorly characterized magmatic units are dated using precise methods. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the Damara Orogen sedimentary basinal responses are important in recording the evolution of the fold belt. Here we integrate sedimentological patterns and tectonics to characterise the basin development of both the pre- to syn-orogenic Damara Sequence and the syn- to post-orogenic Nama Group. The evolution of an entire Late Proterozoic Wilson Cycle involved initial rifting, with the opening of two oceanic arms through convergence to collision and foreland basin development. Rift initiation (stage 1) took place along old tectonic weaknesses and extensional rift basins (stage 2) were filled by continental sediments and alkaline/bimodal volcanics. Two oceanic openings occurred: (i) the Adamastor Ocean (stage 3) produced a break-up unconformity and eastward transgression over the Kalahari and Congo Cratons; and (ii) the Khomas Sea gulf subsequently developed betwen the two cratons (stage 4) and is associated with break-up unconformities, and ultimately the development of mature shleves (stage 5). In the latter opening, we envisage an anticlockwise rotation of the Kalahari Craton with respect to the Congo Craton. During convergence the closing Khomas Sea produced an accretionary prism/arc/retro-arc system (stage 6) and the first deformation phase in the Southern Zone. The Khomas Orogeny records the collision between the Kalahari and Congo Cratons (stage 7) including the obduction of oceanic elements onto the Kalahari Craton foreland, and caused the second and third deformation phases in the Southern Zone and first and second deformation phases in the Central Zone. A peripheral foreland basin and peripheral bulge on the Kalahari Craton resulted, which respectively contained and affected the marine and fluvial Nama Group sedimentation. A complementary hinterland basin accepted Mulden Group sediments on the Congo Craton. Ultimately the collision of the South American continent with the newly reconstituted African foreland (stage 8) caused the Adamastor Orogeny and produced a peripheral foreland basin. This basin was divided into two parts by the extant Khomas mountain belt. This event resulted in a dominant westerly source for the fluvial Fish River Subgroup and exclusion of previous marine conditions. We distinguish for the first time, the temporal separation of the Khomas and Khomas and Adamstor Orogenesis. The Khomas Orogeny involved the subduction of hot young oceanic crust associated with the relatively short residence time of the Khomas Sea, and can be dated at just before the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. In contrast, the Adamastor Ocean had a residence time of about 200 M.a. Convergence therefore involved the subduction of cooled oceanic crust and incorporation of exotic terranes. Collision was associated with relatively major translation of tectonostratigraphic units. The Adamastor Orogeny occurred close to 500 M.a.},

abstract = {The partitioning of samarium and thulium between garnets and melts in the systems Mg3Al2-Si3O12-H2O and Ca3Al2Si3O12-H2O has been studied as a function of REE concentration in the garnets at 30 kbar pressure. Synthesis experiments of variable time under constant P, T conditions indicate that garnet initially crystallizes rapidly to produce apparent values of D Sm (D Sm=concentration of Sm in garnet/concentration of Sm in liquid) which are too large in the case of pyrope and too small in the case of grossular. As the experiment proceeds, Sm diffuses out of or into the garnet and the equilibrium value of D Sm is approached. Approximate values of diffusion coefficients for Sm in pyrope garnet obtained by this method are 6 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 at 1,300 ° C and 2 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 at 1,500 ° C, and for grossular, 8.3 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 at 1,200 ° C and 4.6 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 at 1,300 ° C. The equilibrium values of D Sm have been reversed by experiments with Sm-free pyrope and Sm-bearing glass, and with Sm-bearing grossular and Sm-free glass. Between 12 ppm and 1,000 ppm Sm in pyrope at 1,300 ° C and between 80 ppm and {\textgreater}2 wt.{\%} Tm in pyrope at 1,500 ° C, partition coefficients are constant and independent of REE concentration. Above 100 ppm of Sm in garnet at 1,500 ° C, partition coefficients are independent of Sm concentration. At lower concentrations, however, D Sm is dependent upon the Sm content of the garnet. The two regions may be interpreted in terms of charge-balanced substitution of Sm3Al5O12 in the garnet at high Sm concentrations and defect equilibria involving cation vacancies at low concentrations. At very low REE concentrations ({\textless} 1 ppm Tm in grossular at 1,300 ° C) DREE garnet/liquid again becomes constant with an apparent Henry's Law value greater than that at high concentrations. This may be interpreted in terms of a large abundance of cation vacancies relative to the number of REE ions. The importance of defects in the low concentration region has been confirmed by adding other REE (at 80 ppm level) to the system Mg3Al2Si3O12-H2O at low Sm concentrations. These change D Sm in the defect region, demonstrating their role in the production of vacancies. Experiments on a natural pyropic garnet indicate that defect equilibria are of importance to REE partitioning within the concentration ranges found in nature.},

abstract = {We evaluate the190Pt-186Os decay system, measured by laser ablation MC-ICPMS, as a useful geochronometric tool for direct dating of platinum-group minerals (PGM) in large mafic/ultra-mafic intrusions by analysing mineralised rocks from the geochronologically well constrained Bushveld Complex, S. Africa. Mixed PGM (laurite, cooperite, laurite-platarsite, sperrylite and Pt-Fe alloy) from the Merensky Reef yield a Pt-Os isochron age of 1995±50Ma (2$\sigma$, n=48, MSWD=1.16, initial186Os/188Os=0.119819±0.000006). While this is 59Myr younger than the U-Pb zircon age for the Merensky Reef (Scoates and Friedman, 2008) it is consistent with recent Re-Os ages for the Platreef. Considering the younger age recorded by both Re-Os and Pt-Os systems, we propose that the Pt-Os isochron age records a late, low temperature hydrothermal event affecting PGM and sulphides in the Platreef and Merensky Reef.Pt-rich phases may also yield single grain190Pt-186Os model ages since initial186Os/188Os can be well constrained. A Pt-Os model age of 2024Ma±101Ma was calculated for a Merensky cooperite; a Pt-Fe alloy from the Onverwacht pipe and a Tweefontein Hill sperrylite give Pt-Os model ages of 2113±106Ma and 2042±102Ma, respectively. A Pt-Os isochron derived from all Bushveld units gives an age of 2012±47Ma (2$\sigma$,186Os/188Osi=0.119818±0.000006) with an MSWD of 1.19, hence PGE mineralisation in different stratigraphic horizons of the complex cannot be distinguished temporally using the Pt-Os chronometer. Nonetheless, the potential for the Pt-Os system in dating events in PGE mineralised systems is evident and the agreement of single grain model ages in high Pt/Os phases with the Pt-Os and Re-Os isochron ages indicates their usefulness in the geochronology of these systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The phase relations encompass a divariant surface in P-T space. Comparison of the carbonatitic melts produced at the low-temperature side of this surface with naturally occurring carbonatites indicates that natural magnesiocarbonatites could be generated over a wide range of pressures {\textgreater}2{\{}middle dot{\}}5 GPa. Melts analogous to kimberlites form at higher temperatures along the divariant surface, which suggests that kimberlite genesis requires more elevated geotherms. However, the amount of water found in some kimberlites has the potential to lower temperatures for the generation of kimberlitic melts by up to 150{\{}degrees{\}}C, provided no hydrous phases are present. Compositions resembling group IB and IA kimberlites are produced at pressures around 5-6 GPa and 10 GPa, respectively, whereas the compositions of some other kimberlites suggest generation at higher pressures still. At pressures {\textless}4 GPa, an elevated geotherm produces melilitite-like melt in the CMAS-CO2 system rather than kimberlite. Even when a relatively CO2-rich mantle composition containing 0{\{}middle dot{\}}15 wt {\%} CO2 is assumed, kimberlites and melilitites are produced by {\textless}1{\%} melting and carbonatites are generated by even smaller degrees of melting of {\textless}0{\{}middle dot{\}}5{\%}.},

abstract = {The Early Cretaceous Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) represents by far the largest igneous event on Earth in the last 200 Ma and yet, despite its size, the OJP's basaltic crust appears to be remarkably homogeneous in composition. The most abundant rock type is a uniform low-K tholeiite, represented by the Kwaimbaita Formation on Malaita and found at all but one of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill sites on the plateau and in the adjacent basins. This is capped by a thin and geographically restricted veneer of a slightly more incompatible-element-rich tholeiite (the Singgalo Formation on Malaita and the upper flow unit at ODP Site 807), distinguished from Kwaimbaita-type basalt by small but significant differences in Sr-, Nd- and Pb-isotope ratios. A third magma type is represented by high-Mg (Kroenke-type) basalt found in thick 100 m) successions of lava flows at two drill sites (ODP Sites 1185 and 1187) 146 km apart on the eastern flank of the plateau. The high-Mg basalt is isotopically indistinguishable from Kwaimbaita-type basalt and may therefore represent the parental magma for the bulk of the OJP. Low-pressure fractional crystallization of olivine followed by olivine+augite+plagioclase can explain the compositional range from high-Mg Kroenke-type to Kwaimbaita-type basalt. The Singgalo-type basalt probably represents slightly smaller-degree, late-stage melting of an isotopically distinct component in the mantle source. Primary magma compositions, calculated by incremental addition of equilibrium olivine to aphyric Kroenke-type basalt glass, contain between 15.6{\%} (in equilibrium with Fo90) and 20.4{\%} (Fo92) MgO. Incompatible-element abundances in the primary OJP magma can be modelled by around 30{\%} melting of a peridotitic primitive-mantle source from which about 1{\%} by mass of average continental crust had previously been extracted. This large degree of melting implies decompression of very hot (potential temperature {\textgreater}1500degreesC) mantle beneath very thin lithosphere. The initiation of an exceptionally large and hot plume head close to a mid-ocean ridge provides the best explanation for the size, homogeneity and composition of the OJP, but is difficult to reconcile with the submarine eruption of virtually all of the basalt so far sampled.},

Phosphorus is most strongly enriched in the basic melt (by a factor of 10), followed by rare earth elements, Ta, Ca, Cr, Ti, Mn, Zr, Mg, Sr, and Ba (enriched by a factor of 1.5). Of the elements studied, only Cs is enriched in the acidic melt. The two-liquid partition coefficients of Zr, Ta, Sm, and Mn are constant for concentrations ranging from {\textless}0.1{\%} to as high as 1 wt.-{\%}, suggesting that Henry's law is applicable in silicate melts (at least for these elements) to concentrations well above typical trace element levels in rocks. The strong relative preference of many elements for the basic melt implies that the structural characteristics of basic melts more readily permit stable coordination of cations by oxygen. Partitioning of elements between crystal and liquid in a magma must therefore be influenced by the composition (and consequent structure) of the liquid. Application of the two-liquid partition coefficients to possible occurrences of liquid immiscibility in magmas reveals that typical basalt-rhyolite associations are probably not generated by two-liquid phase separation. However, liquid immiscibility cannot be discounted as a possible origin for lamprophyric rocks containing felsic segregations.},

abstract = {Of {\~{}}35 Archean cratons that have been identified around the globe, only one, the Superior craton of the Canadian Shield, has a reasonably well-defined apparent polar wander (APW) path for much of Paleoproterozoic time based on 'key' (i.e., well-defined and precisely dated) paleopoles. As a result it has been difficult to compare the drift of these cratons or reliably test continental reconstructions of the Archean cratons in the Paleoproterozoic based on paleomagnetism. In this study, we report key paleopoles for the 2.13-2.11 Ga northwest- to north-northwest-trending Indin dyke swarm (36?? N, 76?? W, A95=7??) and the 1.885 Ga northeast- to north-northeast-trending Ghost swarm (2?? N, 106?? W, A95=6??) of the Yellowknife region of the Slave craton. U-Pb baddeleyite ages have been determined at paleomagnetic sampling sites and baked contact tests establish that the remanences are primary. Combined with paleopoles from other precisely dated dyke swarms of the Slave craton, these data define a rudimentary APW path between ca. 2.23 and 1.885 Ga, and permit a comparison of the drift of the Slave and Superior cratons over this interval. Both the Indin and Ghost poles are precisely matched in age with key poles on the Superior APW path. The Slave and Superior paths are not superimposed demonstrating that the two cratons were not in their present relative locations. They have different overall shapes indicating relative drift during at least a portion of the period. However, the earlier (2.23-2.21 Ga) portions of the tracks appear broadly similar and could permit the two cratons to be on a single tectonic plate at that time, although separated by a great distance. A comparison of the Ghost pole and a coeval key pole for Siberia permits a 1.88 Ga reconstruction with southern Siberia facing the northern Slave/Laurentia margin, broadly similar to reconstructions that have been proposed at least as late as 1.38 Ga, although the distance between the cratons is still poorly constrained.},

abstract = {The Tchivira alkaline-carbonatite complex, of Lower Cretaceous age (130-138 Ma), crops out in the Precambrian crystalline basement of southwestern Angola as a circular intrusion covering an area of about 100 km2. The plutonic complex forms a roughly circular concentric pattern and comprises, from the outside inward, nepheline syenites, ijolites/urtites and carbonatites. The western side of the complex is cut by a second intrusion of alkali gabbros and syenites. Bonga, an isolated plug a few kilometres northeast of Tchivira, consists exclusively of carbonatites with an area of about 12 km2. A number of dykes, ranging in composition from tephrite to alkali basalt, hawaiite, mugearite, phonolite and trachy-phonolite, are widespread in the complex and in the basement country rocks. Field relationships and petrological data can be used to define two magmatic suites: 1) nepheline syenite-ijolitecarbonatite, and 2) alkali gabbro-syenite, both of which evolved essentially by fractional crystallization under nearly closed system conditions. Mass balance calculations account for the generation of the various rock-types in both suites, starting from basanitic and alkali basaltic parental magmas, respectively. Ca-carbonatite melts may be genetically linked to nepheline syenite by liquid immiscibility processes, and may themselves undergo fractional crystallization -mostly of calcite- leading to differentiated Mg-carbonatites. Initial 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios mostly range from 0.7038 to 0.7050 in the nepheline syenite-ijolite suite, and from 0.7046 to 0.7059 in the alkali gabbro- syenite suite. Significantly higher isotopic ratios (0.7073-0.7255), which are observed in some dykes and in the border facies of the intrusion, may be related to contamination by the granitic basement. The age relations, petrology, Sr isotopes, rock associations and spatial arrangements of the Tchivira-Bonga complex are comparable with those of the south Brazilian alkaline-carbonatite complexes, particularly Juqui{\`{a}} and Jacupiranga. Such a comparison suggests a common geodynamic and petrogenetic setting for the South Brazilian and Angolan alkaline magmatic suites just before the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {We have analysed sulphides, silicates, and chromites of the Merensky Reef for platinum-group elements (PGEs), Re and Au using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and synthetic pyrrhotite standards annealed with known quantities of noble metals. Os, Ir and Ru reside in solid solution in pyrrhotite and pentlandite, Rh and part of the Reef's Pd in pentlandite, whereas Pt, Au, Re and some Pd form discrete phases. Olivine and chromite, often suspected to carry Os, Ir and Ru, are PGE free. All phases analysed contain noble metals as discrete micro-inclusions with diameters typically {\textless}100 nm. Inclusions in sulphides commonly have the element combinations Os–Ir–Pt and Pt–Pd–Au. Inclusions in olivine and chromite are dominated by Pt ± Au–Pd. Few inclusion spectra can be related to discrete noble metal phases, and few inclusions have formed by sub-solidus exsolution. Rather, some PGE inclusions, notably those in olivine and chromite, are early-magmatic nuggets trapped when their host phases crystallized. We suggest that the silicate melt layer that preceded the Merensky Reef was PGE oversaturated at early cumulus times. Experiments combined with available sulphide–silicate partition coefficients suggest that a silicate melt in equilibrium with a sulphide melt containing the PGE spectrum of the Merensky ore would indeed be oversaturated with respect to the least soluble noble metals. Sulphide melt apparently played little role in enriching the noble metals in the Merensky Reef; rather, its role was to immobilize a pre-existing in situ stratiform PGE anomaly in the liquid-stratified magma chamber.},

abstract = {Total CO2 output from fumaroles, bubbling and water dissolved gases and soil gases was investigated at Pantelleria Island volcano, Italy. The preliminary results indicate an overall output of 0.39 Mt a−1 of CO2 from the island. The main contribution to the total output was from diffuse soil degassing (about 0.32 Mt a−1), followed by dissolved CO2 (0.034 Mt a−1), focussed soil degassing (0.028 Mt a−1) and bubbling CO2 (0.013 Mt a−1). The contribution of CO2 from fumarole gases was found to be negligible (1.4×10−6 Mt a−1). Carbon-13 values for CO2 coupled with those for associated He in gases from fumaroles and sites of focussed soil degassing clearly rule out any significant organic CO2 component and suggest a common mantle origin for these gas species. The inferred mantle source beneath Pantelleria would seem to have peculiar geochemical characteristics, quite distinct from those of mantle producing MORB but compatible with those of magmatic sources of central Mediterranean and central European volcanoes. These findings indicate that the Pantelleria volcanic complex is a site of active mantle degassing that is worthy of attention for future geochemical surveillance of the island.},

abstract = {The restriction of most carbonatites to continental areas raises questions as to whether the parental liquids to carbonatites are generated within the continental lithosphere, or whether they are derived from deeper parts of the mantle with the lithosphere playing a subsidiary, but important, role in trapping volatile-rich melts/fluids. The constraints imposed by both radiogenic and stable isotopic data from carbonatites world-wide are consistent with a sub-lithospheric source for the parental melts, associated with either asthenospheric ‘upwellings' or more deep-seated, plume-related activity. Crucial evidences that support the generation of carbonated melts from sub-lithospheric mantle are: the petrogenetic and temporal association of carbonatites with large igneous provinces (LIPs; e.g., Deccan, Parana), carbonatites with primitive noble gas isotopic signatures, radiogenic isotope ratios similar to OIBs (i.e. involving HIMU, EM1 and FOZO mantle components), and the uniform, time-integrated Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd development lines for Sr and Nd isotopic data for carbonatites from the Superior Province, Canada, and the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Such findings are difficult to reconcile with a lithospheric origin. Even if a metasomatized lithospheric mantle is considered to be the sole source of carbonated melts, an unknown mantle process is required, large enough to generate widespread, synchronous metasomatism spanning regions in excess of 1 × 106 km2.},

abstract = {Nd and Sr initial isotope ratios are reported for 17 Mesozoic plutons of the Monteregian Hills and White Mountain series provinces in northeastern North America. Some variation in the isotopic ratios at most localities is caused by crustal-contamination processes. When the crustal assimilation effects are taken into account, the initial ratios for apparently uncontaminated, mantle-derived parental magmas show only restricted range in 87Sr/86Sr (0.7032 to 0.7040) and $\epsilon$Nd (T) (+5.4 to +2.3), which are inversely correlated. These ratios characterize alkaline to subalkaline magmas emplaced over more than 400 km2 and about 80 m.y. The isotopic and trace-element characteristics are broadly similar to those of many modern ocean-island basalts, specifically the New England Seamounts, suggesting similar time-integrated, lithophile-element-depleted mantle sources. The results are consistent with plume-related mantle sources deeper than the subcontinental mantle.},

Unlike most consumers, geoscientists can become involved in responsible sourcing, including best environmental and social practices, because geology is related to environmental impact factors such as energy requirements, resource efficiency, radioactivity and the amount of rock mined. The energy and material inputs and the emissions and waste from mining and processing can be quantified, and studies for REEs show little difference between 'hard rocks', such as carbonatites, and easily leachable ion-adsorption clays. The reason is the similarity in the embodied energy in the chemicals used for leaching, dissolution and separation.},

abstract = {The late tectonic evolution of the Slave craton involves extensive magmatism, deformation, and high temperature-low pressure (HT-LP) metamorphism. We argue that the nature of these tectonic events is difficult to reconcile with early, pre-2.7 Ga development and preservation of a thick tectosphere, and suggest that crust–mantle coupling and stabilization occurred only late in the orogenic development of the craton. The extent and repetitiveness of the tectonic reworking documented within the Mesoarchean basement complex of the western Slave, together with the development of large-volume, extensional mafic magmatism at 2.7 Ga within the basement complex argue against preservation of a widespread, thick, cool Mesoarchean tectosphere beneath the western Slave craton prior to Neoarchean tectonism. Broad-scale geological and geophysical features of the Slave craton, including orientation of an early F1 fold belt, distribution of ca. 2.63–2.62 Ga plutonic rocks, and the distribution of geochemical, petrological and geophysical domains within the mantle lithosphere collectively highlight the importance of an NE–SW structural grain to the craton. These trends are oblique to the earlier, ca. 2.7 Ga north–south trending boundary between Mesoarchean and Neoarchean crustal domains, and are interpreted to represent a younger structural feature imposed during northwest or southeast-vergent tectonism at ca. 2.64–2.61 Ga. Extensive plutonism, in part mantle-derived, crustal melting and associated HT-LP metamorphism argue for widespread mantle heat input to the crust, a feature most consistent with thin ({\textless}100 km) lithosphere at that time. We propose that the mantle lithosphere developed by tectonic imbrication of one or more slabs subducted beneath the craton at the time of development of the D1 structural grain, producing the early 2.63–2.62 Ga arc-like plutonic rocks. Subsequent collision (external to the present craton boundaries) possibly accompanied by partial delamination of some of the underthrust lithosphere, produced widespread deformation (D2) and granite plutonism throughout the province at 2.6–2.58 Ga. An implication of this model is that diamond formation in the Slave should be Neoarchean in age.},

abstract = {XRF analyses of 152 magmatic dyke samples from a broad area (150 × 60 km) of the Gardar Province in Southern Greenland span the time 1280 to 1163 Ma and represent a wide compositional range (transitional olivine basalts to trachytes, alkalinity index of 0.3 to 1.5). Among those, 16 dyke samples were additionally analysed for Cl and Br.
Generally, the dykes represent a continuous fractionation trend from relatively unfractionated basalts to more highly fractionated trachytes. Dykes from different areas exhibit a diverse geochemistry suggesting a heterogeneous and metasomatised mantle source. Enrichment in LILE, LREE and Sr and depletion in HFSE, Nb and Ti suggest that some of the metasomatism may have been associated with subduction processes pre-dating Gardar activity by some 600 Ma (Ketilidian orogeny).
The dykes are characterised by high F contents up to 1.2 wt.{\%}, particularly in the vicinity of the Ivigtut fluoride deposit. F was probably derived from partial melting of lithospheric mantle enriched in F-apatite and F-phlogopite. High Cl/Br ({\textgreater}500) and low Cl/F ({\textless}1) ratios of the dykes point to a fluid degassing/separation process which is supported by mineral/rock and fluid inclusion data from the Il{\'{i}}maussaq and Ivigtut intrusions. There, the analysed rocks and minerals generally show high Cl/Br ({\textgreater}300) and low Cl/F ({\textless}1) weight ratios whereas the fluid inclusions have complementary low ratios (Cl/Br ±100; Cl/F {\textgreater}10). Our investigations are in accordance with experimental data which show that F is preferentially enriched in the melt whereas Cl and especially Br are lost with the fluid phase. Accordingly, the halogens show an increase in incompatible behaviour in the magma in the order of F {\textless} Cl {\textless} Br.},

abstract = {Due to the large partition coefficients of garnet for Lu compared to Sm, Nd, and Hf, garnet residual from crustal melting events has a large potential for retaining Lu and, over time, producing high 176Hf177Hf reservoirs in the lower crust. Therefore, melts derived from such garnet-bearing residual assemblages may be high in 176Hf177Hf relative to 143Nd144Nd. In order to determine the extent of potential hafnium isotopic heterogeneities in the lower crust from residual garnet, and to detail coupled HfNd isotopic behavior in older crustal rocks in general, we have determined the hafnium and neodymium isotopic compositions of thirty-two Precambrian granites and rhyolites from diverse suites of crustally derived magmatic suites. The majority of these rocks are known, from major-element and neodymium isotopic evidence, to have been derived from older ({\textgreater}300 m.y.) crust.

Modeling of LuHf and SmNd partitioning during melting events in the lower crust indicates that anomalously high 176Hf177Hf compositions should develop within 300–400 m.y. in residual assemblages provided melting was at least 25–30{\%} and 10{\%} or more garnet was left in the residue. In spite of the diverse older crustal sources for the granites and rhyolites in this study, and the potential for garnet to be present in their source regions, none of the granitoids have anomalously high initial 176Hf177Hf compositions: all samples (with one exception) have initial Hf and Nd compositions that plot within a ±8 ϵHf unit wide band of the reference line (ϵHf = 2ϵNd + 2) for juvenile crust. The absence of high initial 176Hf177Hf compositions in these granites and rhyolites most likely implies that either (1) garnet is not a common residual phase in the lower crust or (2) garnet-bearing restite is not easily incorporated into later melts or (3) not enough time was available to develop anomalous Hf compositions.},

abstract = {The viscosities of hydrous haplogranitic melts synthesized by hydrothermal fusion at 2 kbar pressure and 800 to 1040° C have been measured at temperatures just above the glass transition and at a pressure of 1 bar using micropenetration techniques. The micropenetration viscometry has been performed in the viscosity range of 109 Pa s to 1012 Pa s. The samples ranged in water content from 0.4 to 3.5 wt{\%}. For samples with up to 2.5 wt{\%} H2O, the water contents have been determined using infrared spectroscopy obtained before and after each viscometry experiment to be constant over the duration of the measurements. Above this water content a measurable loss of water occurs during the viscometry. The viscosity data illustrate an extremely nonlinear decrease in viscosity with added water. The viscosity drops drastically with the addition of 0.5 wt{\%} of water and then shallows out at water contents of 2 wt{\%}. An additional viscosity datum point obtained from the analysis of fluid inclusions in a water-saturated HPG8 confirms a near invariance of the viscosity with the addition of water between 2 and 6 wt{\%}. These measurements may be compared directly with the data of Hess et al. (1995, in press) for the effects of excess alkali and alkaline earth oxides on the viscosity of HPG8 (also obtained at 1 bar). The viscosity of the melts, compared on an equivalent molar basis, increases in the order H2O{\textless}(Li2O{\textless}Na2O{\textless} K2O{\textless}Rb2O,Cs2O{\textless}BaO{\textless}SrO{\textless}CaO{\textless}MgO{\textless} BeO). The extraordinary decrease in melt viscosity with added water is poorly reproduced by the calculation scheme of Shaw (1972) for the range of water contents investigated here. The speciation of water in the quenched glasses can be used to quantify the dependence of the viscosity on hydroxyl content. Considering only the hydroxyl groups as active fluidizers in the hydrous melts the nonlinearity of the viscosity decrease and the difference with the effects of the alkali oxides becomes larger. Consequences for degassing calcalkaline rhyolite are discussed.},

abstract = {We have analysed sulphides, silicates, and chromites of the Merensky Reef for platinum-group elements (PGEs), Re and Au using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and synthetic pyrrhotite standards annealed with known quantities of noble metals. Os, Ir and Ru reside in solid solution in pyrrhotite and pentlandite, Rh and part of the Reef's Pd in pentlandite, whereas Pt, Au, Re and some Pd form discrete phases. Olivine and chromite, often suspected to carry Os, Ir and Ru, are PGE free. All phases analysed contain noble metals as discrete micro-inclusions with diameters typically {\textless}100 nm. Inclusions in sulphides commonly have the element combinations Os–Ir–Pt and Pt–Pd–Au. Inclusions in olivine and chromite are dominated by Pt ± Au–Pd. Few inclusion spectra can be related to discrete noble metal phases, and few inclusions have formed by sub-solidus exsolution. Rather, some PGE inclusions, notably those in olivine and chromite, are early-magmatic nuggets trapped when their host phases crystallized. We suggest that the silicate melt layer that preceded the Merensky Reef was PGE oversaturated at early cumulus times. Experiments combined with available sulphide–silicate partition coefficients suggest that a silicate melt in equilibrium with a sulphide melt containing the PGE spectrum of the Merensky ore would indeed be oversaturated with respect to the least soluble noble metals. Sulphide melt apparently played little role in enriching the noble metals in the Merensky Reef; rather, its role was to immobilize a pre-existing in situ stratiform PGE anomaly in the liquid-stratified magma chamber.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic ({\~{}}723–716 Ma) Franklin Large Igneous Province exposed on Victoria Island in the Canadian Arctic is comprised of a sill-dominated magma plumbing system overlain by the coeval Natkusiak flood basalts. We have investigated three sections, separated by a total of {\textgreater}50 km of distance, of a sill (the Fort Collinson Sill Complex) emplaced just above a prominent sedimentary marker unit. The sill is characterized by a basal olivine-enriched layer (OZ: up to 55 {\%} olivine) and an upper gabbroic unit. The observed diversity of olivine compositions in the OZ implies that bulk-rock MgO versus FeO arrays reflect accumulation of a heterogeneous olivine crystal cargo. We suggest that the OZ was formed as a late olivine slurry replenishment in a partially crystallized gabbroic sill, propagating for over 50 km along strike. This interpretation is consistent with Pb-isotope data, which show that at least three geochemically distinct magmas were emplaced into the Fort Collinson Sill Complex. The OZs exhibit a gradual westward evolution toward more Fe-rich bulk compositions. This is best explained by progressive mixing of the replenishing olivine slurry with a resident gabbroic mush during westward flow. Pb-isotopic signatures suggest that magmas near the inferred conduit feeder assimilated small amounts ({\textless}10 {\%}) of dolostone country rock, which may have locally buffered olivine compositions to high-Fo contents.},

abstract = {The Siberian flood-volcanic event is the most voluminous and explosive, continental, volcanic event known in the Phanerozoic record. U–Pb perovskite and zircon ages were obtained for lavas of the lowermost unit (251.7±0.4 Ma) and near-uppermost unit (251.1±0.3 Ma), respectively, of the volcanic sequence in the Maymecha–Kotuy area, Russia. Along with stratigraphic correlations and paleomagnetic evidence, these ages suggest that rapid extrusion of the entire ∼6500 m thick composite sequence occurred in less than 1 million years. The time of extrusion coincides precisely with an age of 251.4±0.3 Ma previously obtained for the Permian–Triassic mass-extinction event, the most devastating biotic crisis known. Emplacement of the Noril'sk–Talnakh ore-bearing intrusions, notable for their prodigious Cu–Ni–PGE deposits, was synchronous with these two major geologic events at 251.2±0.3 Ma. The Guli volcanic-intrusive complex in the Maymecha–Kotuy area appears to represent the final mafic magmatism of the entire Siberian flood-volcanic event. Baddeleyite from a carbonatite that intrudes the complex gives an age of 250.2±0.3 Ma, and shows possible 231Pa excess. The Bolgokhtokh granodiorite stock has a zircon age of 229.0±0.4 Ma, and represents the youngest known magmatism in the region.},

The igneous complex consists of a suite of mela-syenites, syenites and alkali feldspar syenites, and a carbonatite suite comprising clinopyroxenites with calcite and calcite-garnet lenses, feldspathic clinopyroxenites and s{\"{o}}vites with wollastonite-rich lenses. The two suites are considered independent magmatic sequences. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the syenite suite represents a coherent fractionation sequence which evolved by predominantly clinopyroxene, and subordinate fluorapatite and magnetite fractionation at 5–6 kbar. The mid-crustal crystallisation level is supported by the supposed cumulative character of most lithologies of the carbonate suite. Clinopyroxenites and calcite ± garnet lenses of the carbonatite suite are considered largely cumulative rocks and represent the lower portion of a carbonatite magma chamber that crystallised clinopyroxene, calcite, andraditic garnet, titanite and fluorapatite. U-Pb dating of titanites suggests an intrusion age of 837 + 60/−49 Ma, and a metamorphic overprint at 558 ± 5 Ma. These age constraints indicate a rift-related setting of the Otjisazu Carbonatite Complex within the Damaran Orogen.

abstract = {Semiempirical parameterizations of the values and trends of variation of Nernst trace element partition coefficient data for Ca-rich clinopyroxene (cpx/liquidD) are provided, applicable mainly to common terrestrial magmatic suites. cpx/liquidD data for most trace elements show significant variability which cannot be neglected when modeling melting and crystallization. The influence of pressure on cpx/liquidD is strong for many elements, particularly Na and Sr, which increase as pressure rises, and most high-field strength elements, which decrease with increasing pressure. Most cpx/liquidD values increase as temperature decreases, as wt {\%} melt MgO, MgO{\#} (MgO/MgO+FeOtotal), CaO, and FeO contents drop, as cpx molar Mg{\#} (Mg/Mg+Fetotal) decreases, and as wt {\%} melt SiO2 and Na2O+K2O increase. No clear trends are seen for variations of cpx/liquidD against melt H2O. For mafic melts, many elements show well-defined trends of cpx/liquidD increase as the clinopyroxene tetrahedral Al content (cpx Aliv) increases. Many cpx/liquidD are well correlated against cpx/liquidDTi, and many near-neighbor elements show good cpx/liquidD intercorrelations (e.g., Zr-Hf, U-Th, Nb-Ta, La-Ce, Yb-Lu). Cpx/liquidD profiles calculated from these parameterizations can constrain changes of D values during melting or crystallization. Cpx/liquidD for the rare earth elements were fit to the lattice strain model to derive fits that can reproduce the cpx/liquidDREE profile shapes (REE=rare earth elements). These fits indicate that cpx/liquidDREE for melts more evolved than picritic basalts cannot be modeled assuming that all REE are in octahedral coordination in a single M2 site, but also require sixfold partitioning into an M1 site for Lu-Yb-Tm-Er.},

abstract = {The concentration of tungsten (W) in basaltic melts provides a window into the behavior of this element during core–mantle separation, crust formation, silicate differentiation, and potentially core–mantle interaction. We have analyzed an extensive suite of modern basalts (n = 86) for their trace element chemistry via laser ablation ICP-MS, with barium (Ba), thorium (Th), uranium (U), and W concentrations typically determined to ≤ 5{\%} (2$\sigma$) uncertainty. We find that the partitioning behavior of U mirrors that of W during basalt genesis, whereas Ba and Th both behave more incompatibly. The W/U ratio of our complete sample suite (0.65 ± 0.45, 2$\sigma$) is representative of the mean modern mantle, and is indistinguishable from that of mid-ocean ridge basalts (W/UMORB = 0.65 ± 0.41, n = 52), ocean island basalts (W/UOIB = 0.63 ± 0.07, n = 10), and back-arc basin basalts (W/UBABB = 0.62 ± 0.09, n = 12). This ratio is also consistent with the W/U ratio of the continental crust, and thus represents the W/U ratio of the entire silicate portion of the Earth. Assuming a concentration of 20 ± 8 (2$\sigma$) ng/g U in the bulk silicate Earth, the abundance of W in the silicate Earth is 13 ± 10 ng/g. Following mass balance, this implies a mean modern mantle and core composition of 8.3 ± 7.1 ng/g W and 500 ± 120 ng/g W, respectively. Additionally, the MORB source is modeled to contain approximately 3.0 ± 2.3 ng/g W, indicating a four-fold depletion of the highly incompatible elements in the MORB source relative to the silicate Earth. Although both the isotopic composition of W and the constancy of the silicate Earth W/U ratio allow for potential insight into core–mantle exchange, both of these proxies are extremely dependent on the chemical composition of the source. A case study of three Hawaiian picrites with enrichments in 186Os–187Os but terrestrial $\epsilon$182W can be explained by: i) a lack of a core component in the Hawaiian “plume,” ii) crustal contamination, or iii) a source composition enriched in incompatible trace elements relative to the bulk silicate Earth.},

abstract = {AbstractApproximately 0.4{\%} of explosive volcanic eruptions occur within a few days of large, distant earthquakes. This many “triggered” eruptions is much greater than expected by chance. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain triggering through changes in magma overpressure, including the growth of bubbles, the advection of large pressures by rising bubbles, and overturn of magma chambers. Alternatively, triggered eruptions may occur through failure of rocks surrounding stored magma. All these mechanisms require a process that enhances small static stress changes caused by earthquakes or that can convert (the larger) transient, dynamic strains into permanent changes in pressure. All proposed processes, in addition to viscoelastic relaxation of stresses, can result in delayed triggering of eruptions, although quantifying the connection between earthquakes and delayed, triggered eruptions is much more challenging. Mud volcanoes and geysers also respond to distant earthquakes. Mud volcanoes that discharge mud from depths greater than many hundreds of meters may be triggered by liquefaction caused by shaking, and may thus be similar to small mud volcanoes that originate within a few meters of the surface. Changes in permeability of the matrix surrounding main geyser conduits, by opening or creating new fractures, may explain the observed changes in their eruption frequency.},

abstract = {Models of continental flood basalt (CFB) formation are evaluated by examining their implications for the setting, mainly temperature and depth, of melting which is assumed to result from adiabatic decompression. Most attractive is the model of melting in upwelling bodies (probably plume heads) rising to the base of the continental lithosphere. This constrains the melting to 120-150??km or deeper (continental lithospheric thickness) and thus the plume potential temperatures to ??? 300????C higher than ambient mantle. The primary melts should be hot, MgO-rich, modified during ascent, and assimilate components of the lithosphere, which can provide the continental-like geochemical signature of many CFB. Circulation within the upwellings and presence of eclogite patches also influence magma generation and composition. Dehydration melting when plumes heat the lowermost lithosphere can generate CFB only if the source region contains ca. 15{\%} hydrous minerals beneath the entire area covered by flood volcanics, which is difficult to justify. On the other hand, assimilation of "continental" chemical components from large parts of the lithosphere does not require such extreme metasomatism. Decompression melting under strongly thinned rifted lithosphere requires lower potential temperatures of the rising material and lesser modification of the primary magmas than the plume head model of CFB formation. Available observations do not support the contemporaneity of flood volcanism with rifts having the required sizes and histories, but more information is needed to further test this model. On the other hand, magma production can assist rift initiation and lithospheric rupture, so subsequent thinning can explain the common formation of volcanic rifted margins immediately following CFB emplacement. Ancient LIP should record the same processes as seen in young CFB. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Field observations, petrography and magnetic susceptibility fabrics are used to characterize the structure and evolution of the Nebo granite, forming part of the Bushveld Complex, in South Africa. The Nebo granite is the dominant component of the Lebowa granite suite, the largest known anorogenic granitoid complex. It is a composite tabular intrusion, comprising alkali feldspar granites and syenogranites. There are seven main petrographic units, defined by differences in modal content, crystallization sequence, magmatic water content, magnetic susceptibility and magnetic fabric. Each unit was emplaced independently and fed by vertical dykes. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility used to map magmatic fabrics within the granite shows that they are dominantly controlled by alignment of early-crystallizing magnetite and are similar in outcrop and pluton scale. Magnetic foliations and lineations are horizontal, reflecting vertical host-rock compression and horizontal magma flow during emplacement. Space was created by magma pressure which resulted in roof uplift and floor depression: displacements were accommodated by normal and reverse faulting and flexural-slip along bedding planes in host-rock metasediments.},

abstract = {The formation of peralkaline melts is generally recognized to be related to enrichment of the mantle in sodium or potassium during a metasomatic event that predated magma generation. The wide range in mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, and fluid compositions in peralkaline melts are, to a large extent, a function of the sodium/potassium content of these mantle-metasomatizing fluids, which also governs redox conditions. We propose that sodic fluids will reduce the mantle assemblage by depleting ferric iron from garnet to form the aegirine component in pyroxene. In contrast, potassic fluids would oxidize the mantle assemblage by extracting Al2O3 from the garnet to make phlogopite. We suggest that during differentiation of peralkaline melts, once Fe–Ti oxides have been depleted from the assemblage, simple crystallization reactions of common solid phases such as aegirine or arfvedsonite control the oxygen fugacity by equilibria such as Hence, the more persodic a melt is, the more aegirine will be crystallized and the more reduced this melt will be. This is because without a mineral donor for ferric iron, the crystal chemical forcing of the coupled crystallization of Na with Fe3+ drives oxidation of the dominant Fe2+ in the melt and thereby reduction of the C–H–S–O-bearing fluid and/or melt phase. This is in convincing agreement with observations from a variety of silica-undersaturated peralkaline complexes such as Ilimaussaq in Greenland, Mt. St. Hilaire in Canada, Lovozero and Khibina in Russia, and Tamazeght in Morocco, and explains the occurrence of magmatic methane in the most sodic of these complexes. In silica-oversaturated peralkaline melts such as comendites and pantellerites, however, this equilibrium appears to be less influential and these melts are accordingly less reduced. In perpotassic melts, in contrast, no K–Fe3+ pyroxene is stable and K can only be incorporated into dominantly Fe2+-bearing phases such as biotite or K-amphibole, if no K-feldspar is stable. Here, redox conditions in the coexisting fluid and/or melt are either unaffected or even driven to more oxidized values by the crystallization reactions, which is in accordance with observations on the ultrapotassic rocks of the Roman Province (Italy) or the kalsilite-bearing Murun complex in Siberia. We conclude that peralkalinity in magmatic rocks is tightly connected to oxygen fugacity, that both the generation and the evolution and crystallization of peralkaline melts are governed by redox equilibria, and that these depend strongly on the Na/K ratio as well as on the (Na + K)/Al ratio of the melt. The specific features of peralkaline rocks, such as the difference between agpaitic and miaskitic rocks, the unusual enrichment of high field strength elements and the occurrence of magmatic hydrocarbons in some of them, can all be explained by the oxygen fugacity-controlling model reactions discussed in this study.},

abstract = {Perovskite and melilite crystals from melilito-lites of the ultramafic alkaline Gardiner complex (East Greenland) contain crystallised melt inclusions derived from: (1) melilitite; (2) low-alkali carbonatite; (3) na-trocarbonatite. The melilitite inclusion (1) homogenisa-tion temperature of 1060 °C is similar to liquidus tem-peratures of experimentally investigated natural melili-tites. The compositions are peralkaline, low in MgO (ca. 5 wt{\%}), Ni and Cr, and they are low-pressure fractionates of more magnesian larnite-normative ul-tramafic lamprophyre-type melts of primary mantle origin. Low-alkali carbonatite compositions (2) homo-genise at 1060–1030 °C and are compositionally similar to immiscible calcite carbonatite dykes derived from the melilitolite magma. Natrocarbonatite inclusions (3) homogenise between 1030 and 900 °C and are compo-sitionally similar to natrocarbonatite lava from Old-oinyo Lengai. Nephelinitic to phonolitic dykes which are related to the calcite carbonatite dykes, are very Zr-rich and agpaitic (molecular Na 2 O + K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 {\textgreater} 1.2) and resemble nephelinites of Oldoinyo Lengai. The petro-graphic, geochemical and temporal relationships in-dicate unmixing of carbonatite compositions (ca. 10{\%} alkalies) from evolving melilitite melt and continued fractionation of melilitite to nephelinite. It is suggested that the natrocarbonatite compositions represent de-gassed supercritical high temperature fluid formed in a cooling body of strongly larnite-normative nephelinite or evolved melilitite. The Gardiner complex and similar melilitolite and carbonatite-bearing ultramafic alkaline complexes are believed to represent subvolcanic com-plexes formed beneath volcanoes comparable to Old-oinyo Lengai and that the suggested origin of na-trocarbonatite may be applied to natrocarbonatites of Oldoinyo Lengai.},

abstract = {Despite the numerous industrial and scientific applications of gallium, its behavior in nature and the processes that concentrate it to potentially economic levels are poorly understood. Although the main supply of this metal is as a by-product of the mining of bauxite, it is also concentrated by magmatic-hydrothermal processes in peralkaline igneous systems. Here we report the results of a study of the distribution of gallium and the controls on this distribution in the Nechalacho rare metal deposit, Northwest Territories, Canada, which has been shown to contain significant reserves of this critical metal. Electron microprobe analyses and X-ray element maps of gallium-bearing minerals were used to determine the mineralogical distribution of gallium in the Nechalacho intrusive suite. Elevated gallium concentrations were identified in albite, biotite, orthoclase, chlorite, and allanite. Of these aluminum-bearing minerals, the most important hosts of gallium are albite, biotite, and orthoclase. Ferric iron-bearing minerals, including magnetite and aegirine, which were considered potential candidates for gallium sequestration, contain relatively low concentrations of the metal. This behavior of gallium, at least from a magmatic perspective, is consistent with its predicted partitioning between phenocrysts and melt. However, there is also evidence that gallium was redistributed by hydrothermal fluids. Chloritization of biotite resulted in the enrichment of gallium in the secondary mineral (chlorite), and the development of secondary albite (albitization) led to a depletion of gallium in primary albite. On the basis of these results, we argue that the overall distribution of gallium within the Nechalacho deposit was controlled by magmatic crystal fractionation, whereas hydrothermal processes led to local remobilization of the metal. During fractional crystallization, gallium was moderately compatible in minerals such as albite and biotite, whereas it bordered between compatibility and incompatibility in minerals such as magnetite and orthoclase, and was incompatible in aegirine. This resulted in a relatively constant bulk gallium concentration in the Nechalacho deposit, although locally, gallium was remobilized hydrothermally, particularly within the most altered parts of the intrusion, notably, the albitite.},

Their near-global footprint is a testament to coherent interactions among Earth{\&}apos;s atmosphere, oceans, and cryosphere on millennial timescales. Heinrich detritus appears to have been derived from the region around Hudson Strait. It was deposited over approximately 500 +/- 250 years. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the origin of the layers: binge-purge cycle of the Laurentide ice sheet, jokulhlaup activity from a Hudson Bay lake, and an ice shelf buildup/collapse fed by Hudson Strait. To determine the origin of the Heinrich events, I recommend (1) further studies of the timing and duration of the events, (2) further sedimentology study near the Hudson Strait, and (3) greater spatial and temporal resolution studies of the layers as well as their precursory intervals. Studies of previous glacial intervals may also provide important constraints.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of transfer of crustal material from the subducting slab to the overlying mantle wedge are still debated. M{\'{e}}lange rocks, formed by mixing of sediments, oceanic crust, and ultramafics along the slab-mantle interface, are predicted to ascend as diapirs from the slab-top and transfer their compositional signatures to the source region of arc magmas. However, the compositions of melts that result from the interaction of m{\'{e}}langes with a peridotite wedge remain unknown. Here we present experimental evidence that melting of peridotite hybridized by m{\'{e}}langes produces melts that carry the major and trace element abundances observed in natural arc magmas. We propose that differences in nature and relative contributions of m{\'{e}}langes hybridizing the mantle produce a range of primary arc magmas, from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline. Thus, assimilation of m{\'{e}}langes into the wedge may play a key role in transferring subduction signatures from the slab to the source of arc magmas.},

abstract = {The partitioning of U, Th, Pb, Sr, Zr and Ba between coexisting chromian diopsides and haplobasaltic liquids at oxygen fugacities between the iron-w{\"{u}}stite buffer and air at 1285°C has been characterized using secondary ion mass spectrometry. The partition coefficients for Th, U and Zr show a strong dependence on the Al and Na content of the clinopyroxene. A good correlation between IVAl and DTh exists for all recent Th partitioning studies, providing a simple explanation for the two order of magnitude variation in DTh observed in this and previous studies [1,2]. Because mantle clinopyroxenes generally have greater than 5 wt{\%} Al2O3, we suggest that the relevant partition coefficients for U and Th are between 0.01 and 0.02. While variations in Al and Na in clinopyroxene affect the absolute value of the Th and U partition coefficients, they have no effect on their ratio, DThDU. Our results reinforce the inference that equilibrium partitioning of U and Th between clinopyroxene and melt cannot explain the observed 230Th excesses in basalts. Indeed, under the oxygen fugacities relevant to MORB petrogenesis, clinopyroxene has little ability to fractionate U from Th (DThDU {\textless} 2), implying that chemical disequilibrium between melt and wall rock during transport is not required to preserve 230Th excesses generated in the garnet stability field. If the Ba partition coefficient serves as an analog for Ra and the partition coefficient of U5+ serves as an analog for Pa5+, then 226Ra and 231Pa excesses can be generated by clinopyroxene-melt partitioning. Using compositionally dependent partition coefficients, a melting model is used to show that equilibrium porous flow can explain variations in uranium series activities from the East Pacific Rise by varying the depth of melting.},

abstract = {The silico‑carbonatite dykes of the Huanglongpu area, Lesser Qinling, China, are unusual in that they are quartz-bearing, Mo-mineralised and enriched in the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) relative to typical carbonatites. The textures of REE minerals indicate crystallisation of monazite-(Ce), bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce), parisite-(Ce) and aeschynite-(Ce) as magmatic phases. Burbankite was also potentially an early crystallising phase. Monazite-(Ce) was subsequently altered to produce a second generation of apatite, which was in turn replaced and overgrown by britholite-(Ce), accompanied by the formation of allanite-(Ce). Bastn{\"{a}}site and parisite where replaced by synchysite-(Ce) and r{\"{o}}ntgenite-(Ce). Aeschynite-(Ce) was altered to uranopyrochlore and then pyrochlore with uraninite inclusions. The mineralogical evolution reflects the evolution from magmatic carbonatite, to more silica-rich conditions during early hydrothermal processes, to fully hydrothermal conditions accompanied by the formation of sulphate minerals. Each alteration stage resulted in the preferential leaching of the LREE and enrichment in the HREE. Mass balance considerations indicate hydrothermal fluids must have contributed HREE to the mineralisation. The evolution of the fluorcarbonate mineral assemblage requires an increase in aCa2+and aCO32−in the metasomatic fluid (where a is activity), and breakdown of HREE-enriched calcite may have been the HREE source. Leaching in the presence of strong, LREE-selective ligands (Cl−) may account for the depletion in late stage minerals in the LREE, but cannot account for subsequent preferential HREE addition. Fluid inclusion data indicate the presence of sulphate-rich brines during alteration, and hence sulphate complexation may have been important for preferential HREE transport. Alongside HREE-enriched magmatic sources, and enrichment during magmatic processes, late stage alteration with non-LREE-selective ligands may be critical in forming HREE-enriched carbonatites.},

This study focuses on select Paleoproterozoic intrusions in the southern Slave Craton proximal to and intruding the 2.17 Ga Blatchford Lake intrusive suite, particularly local diabase dyke swarms and two poorly documented plutonic stocks hosted within the Blatchford Lake intrusive suite. The geochemistry and geochronology of these two 1892 {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}} 4 Ma monzonite–diorite stocks suggest that they likely represent the only northwestern extension of the Compton intrusive suite into the Slave Craton. Detailed mapping of these stocks identified cross-cutting diabase dykes and spectacular rhythmically layered gabbroic rafts. The geochemical similarities between the Compton intrusive suite sills located in the East Arm and the two intrusive stocks hosted in the Blatchford Lake intrusive suite support a petrogenetic association, but suggest that parts of the Compton intrusive suite are older than 1865 Ma. Relations between local northwest-trending diabase dykes and the intrusive stocks suggest that the dykes include two sets, one of which is coeval with the intrusion of the stocks. Results from this study indicate that locally a more protracted and complex magmatic history exists than previously considered, a feature that may be reflected in the regional geology.},

abstract = {As technical advances have dramatically increased our ability to analyze trace elements, the need for more reliable data on the compositional dependence of trace element partitioning between minerals and melt has become increasingly important. The late-Cretaceous Carmacks Group of south central Yukon comprises a succession of primitive high-Mg ankaramitic lavas characterized by shoshonitic chemical affinities and containing large complexly zoned clinopyroxene phenocrysts. The compositional zonation of the clinopyroxene phenocrysts is characterized by relatively Fe-rich (Mg{\#} = Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0.85), but mottled, cores surrounded by mantles of cyclically-zoned clinopyroxene whose Mg{\#} varies repeatedly between 0.9 and 0.80. These cyclically zoned clinopyroxene mantles appear to record the repeated influx and mixing of batches of primitive with more evolved magma in a deep sub-crustal (∼1.2 GPa) magma chamber(s). Laser ablation ICP-MS was used to analyze the trace element variation in these zoned clinopyroxenes. The results indicate more than a threefold variation in the absolute concentrations of Th, Zr, rare earth elements (REE), and Y within individual clinopyroxene phenocrysts, with no apparent change in the degree of REE or high field strength element (HFSE) fractionation. The variation in absolute abundances of trace elements correlates closely with the major element composition of the clinopyroxene, with the most enriched clinopyroxene having the lowest Mg{\#} and highest Al contents. The problem is that the amount of crystal fractionation required to explain the major element variation (∼20{\%}) in these clinopyroxene phenocrysts cannot explain the increase in the abundance of the incompatible trace elements, which would require more than 70{\%} crystal fractionation, if constant partition coefficients are assumed. The anomalous increase in incompatible trace elements appears to reflect an increase in their partition coefficients with increasing AlIV in the clinopyroxene; with an increase in Al2O3 from 1.5 to 4.0 wt.{\%} during ∼20{\%} crystal fractionation over a temperature decrease of ∼100°C being associated with more that a threefold increase in the partition coefficients of Th, Zr, REE, and Y. The magnitude of these increases may indicate that the substitution of these trace elements into clinopyroxene is better modeled in some natural systems by a local charge balance model, rather than the distributed charge model that better replicates the results of annealed experiments. These findings indicate that the effect of Al on the partition coefficients of incompatible trace elements in clinopyroxene may be under appreciated in natural magmatic systems and that the application of experimentally determined clinopyroxene partition coefficients to natural systems must be done with caution.},

Ophiolitic sequences are widely recorded from Meso-Cenozoic orogenic belts, but are only rarely documented from Proterozoic-Paleozoic orogens, so that the geodynamic processes responsible for the emplacement of ancient ophiolites are less well understood compared to their younger counterparts. The Damara belt of Namibia represents a deeply eroded Pan-African (550-500 Ma) collisional belt that records subduction and the eventual collision  between the Kalahari and Congo Cratons as part of the amalgamation of the Gondwana supercontinent. The belt has not been affected by later orogenic events so that it preserves the sequence of convergent and collisional tectonics remarkably well. The Southern Zone accretionary prism of the belt records the off-scraping and imbrication of a thick metaturbiditic sequence. Within this sequence, the Matchless Amphibolite Belt forms a narrow, 500-3000 m wide unit of intrusive as well as imbricated mafic metavolcanic and plutonic rocks, with Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) geochemistry, that can be traced almost continuously for over 300 km along strike. Based on the MORB-type geochemistry and preserved textures and rock association, most authors consider the Matchless Amphibolite belt to represent relics of oceanic crust related to the closure of the oceanic basin between the Congo and Kalahari cratons. We have measured two traverses across the Matchless Amphibolite and we report here the evidence that these ophiolitic slivers emplaced during ridgetrench interaction and ridge subduction. We discuss factors that have most likely contributed to the formation and preservation of such an old ridge-trench encounter and its unique geometry.},

abstract = {The El Laco magnetite deposit has been interpreted as lava flows and feeder dikes formed from iron oxide magma, but more recently, as a product of metasomatic replacement. Open-pit exposure created at Laco Sur during the 1990s reveals that the massive magnetite contains magnetite-veined blocks and smaller fragments of altered andesitic volcanic rock, clearly supporting the replacement origin. Open-space growth of magnetite and pyroxene along the walls of chimney structures and veins within magnetite indicates precipitation from aqueous fluid, rather than from gas alone. The native sulfur-bearing, cristobalite-alunite alteration widespread at El Laco, and broadly contemporaneous with magnetite formation, is recognized as part of a steam-heated horizon generated in the vadose zone above a paleowater table. Consequently, the magnetite replacement must have taken place beneath the paleowater table, but probably {\textless}300 m beneath the paleosurface. Thus, mag- netite deposition at or immediately beneath the paleosurface is precluded. The main outstanding question is how hot hypersaline brine, the probable ore-forming fluid at El Laco, attained such shallow crustal levels within a high volcanic edifice without undergoing the extensive groundwater dilution documented from most shallowly preserved hydrothermal systems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. The relationships between trachytes and peralkaline rhyolites (i.e. pantellerites and comendites), which occur in many continental rift systems, oceanic islands and continental intraplate settings, is unclear. To fill this gap, we have performed phase equilibrium experiments on two representative metaluminous trachytes from Pantelleria to determine both their pre-eruptive equilibration conditions (pressure, temperature, H2O content and redox state) and liquid lines of descent. Experiments were performed in the temperature range 750-950°C, pressure 0.5-1.5 kbar and fluid saturation conditions with XH2O [=H2O/(H2O+CO2)] ranging between zero and unity. Redox conditions were fixed below the nickel-nickel oxide buffer (NNO). The results show that at 950°C and melt water contents (H2Omelt) close to saturation, trachytes are at liquidus conditions at all pressures. Clinopyroxene is the liquidus phase, being followed by iron-rich olivine and alkali feldspar. Comparison of experimental and natural phases (abundances and compositions) yields the following pre-eruptive conditions: P=1±0.5 kbar, T=925±25°C, H2Omelt=2±1wt {\%}, and fO2between NNO- 0.5 and NNO- 2. A decrease in temperature from 950°C to 750°C, as well as of H2Omelt, promotes a massive crystallization of alkali feldspar to over 80 wt {\%}. Iron-bearing minerals show gradual iron enrichment when T and fO2decrease, trending towards the compositions of the phenocrysts of natural pantellerites. Despite the metaluminous character of the bulk-rock compositions, residual glasses obtained after 80 wt {\%} crystallization evolve toward comenditic compositions, owing to profuse alkali feldspar crystallization, which decreases the Al2O3of the melt, leading to a consequent increase in the peralkalinity index [PI=molar (Na2O+K2O)/Al2O3]. This is the first experimental demonstration that peralkaline felsic derivatives can be produced by low-pressure fractional crystallization of metaluminous mafic magmas. Our results show that the pantelleritic magmas of basalt-trachyte-rhyolite igneous suites require at least 95 wt {\%} of parental basalt crystallization, consistent with trace element evidence. Redox conditions, through their effect on Fe-Ti oxide stabilities, control the final iron content of the evolving melt.},

abstract = {The Late Pleistocene Mt. Vulture strato-volcano developed at the intersection of NE-SW and NW-SE lithospheric fault systems, on the easternmost border of the Apennine compressional front overthrust onto the Apulian foreland. The initial phase of the volcanic activity is represented by pyroclastic deposits, including lava blocks, and subordinate eccentric domes, mostly phonolitic in composition. The later stages of activity formed the bulk of the strato-volcano (pyroclastic products and subordinate lavas), mostly tephritic in composition, with minor intercalations of basanite, melafoidite and melilitite lavas and dikes. Variations in rock and mineral composition suggest that the volumetrically predominant basanite-tephrite (foidite)-phonotephrite-phonolite series can be accounted for by fractional crystallization processes starting from basanitic parental magmas, in agreement with the remarkably constant Sr- 87/Sr-86 isotopes (0.70586-0.70581). Mass-balance calculations indicate that the variably differentiated magmas may have been produced by removal of wehrlite, clinopyroxenite and syenite cumulates, some of which are occasionally found as cognate xenoliths in the volcanics. Fractionation processes probably developed in multiple-zoned magma chambers, at depths of 35 km, corresponding to the tectonic discontinuity between the allochthonous Apennine formations and the underlying Apulian platform. Highly differentiated phonolitic magmas capping the magma chambers and their conduits thus appear to have fed the initial volcanic activity, whereas dominantly tephritic products were erupted in later stages. The least evolved mafic magmas, namely basanites, mela-foidites and melilitites, axe characterized by diverse Na/K ratios and critical SiO2- undersaturation, which indicate their derivation as independent melts generated from distinct, heterogeneously enriched mantle sources and by variable partial melting degrees. Primitive mantle-normalized incompatible element patterns of Vulture mafic lavas invariably share analogies with both orogenic subduction-related magmas (high Low Field Strength Elements/High Field Strength Elements ratios, K, Rb and Th contents and marked Ti and Nb negative anomalies) and alkaline lavas from within-plate and rift settings (high Light Rare Earth Elements, P, Zr, Nb and Na). These geochemical features may be accounted for by magma generation from deep lithospheric mantle sources, enriched in Na-alkali silicate/carbonatite anorogenic components, subsequently affected by orogenic subduction-related K-metasomatism, analogous to that which modified magma sources of the Roman Magmatic Province along the internal Apennine Chain},

abstract = {Iolite is a non-commercial software package developed to aid in the processing of inorganic mass spectrometric data, with a strong emphasis on visualisation versus time of acquisition. The goal of the software is to provide a powerful framework for data processing and interpretation, while giving users the ability to implement their own data reduction protocols. It is intended to be highly interactive, providing the user with a complete overview of the data at all stages of processing, and allowing the freedom to change parameters and reprocess data at any point. The program presents a variety of windows for the selection and viewing of data versus time, as well as features for the generation of X-Y plots, summary reports and export of data. In addition, it is capable of generating X-Y images from laser ablation rasters, and combining information from up to four separate elemental concentrations (intensities of red, green and blue, and the z-axis) in a false-colour three-dimensional image. By virtue of its underlying computing environment—Igor Pro—Iolite is capable of processing very large datasets (i.e., millions of timeslices) rapidly, and is thus ideal for the interrogation of multi-hour sessions of laser ablation data that can not be easily manipulated in conventional spreadsheet applications, for example. It is also well suited to multi-day sessions of solution-mode inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) or thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) data. A strong emphasis is placed on the interpolation of parameters that vary with time by a variety of user selectable methods including smoothed cubic splines. Data are processed on a timeslice-by-timeslice basis, allowing outlier rejection and calculation of statistics to be employed directly on calculated results. This approach can reduce the risk of processing biases associated with the manipulation of integrated datasets, while also allowing the implementation of more complex data reduction methods.},

abstract = {Apatite is a cumulate phase in the upper parts of some mafic layered intrusions and anorthositic complexes. We investigated the effect of pressure and fluorine on apatite saturation in mafic magmas to better understand under which conditions this mineral crystallizes. Apatite saturation gives information about the formation of silicate rocks, and is of interest in explaining the formation of apatite–oxide-rich rocks (e.g. nelsonites comprising approximately, one-third apatite and two-third Fe–Ti oxide). Two models of formation are proposed for this rock type: crystal fractionation followed by accumulation of apatite and Fe–Ti oxides and liquid immiscibility. New experiments carried out with mafic compositions at 500 MPa confirm that the most important variables on phosphate saturation are SiO2 and CaO. Fluorine addition leads to apatite saturation at lower SiO2 and higher CaO concentrations. Comparison of our results with those of previous experimental studies on liquid–liquid immiscibility at upper-to-mid-crustal conditions allows us to investigate the relative importance of apatite saturation versus liquid–liquid immiscibility in the petrogenesis of nelsonites and similar rocks. The liquid line of descent of three natural examples studied (the Sept-{\^{I}}les intrusive suite, the anorthositic Complex of the Lac-St-Jean and the Skaergaard layered intrusion) do not cross the liquid–liquid immiscibility field before they reach apatite saturation. Thus, the apatite–oxide-rich rock associated with these three intrusive suites are best explained by crystal fractionation followed by accumulation of apatite and Fe–Ti oxides.},

abstract = {Due to its unfavorable rheology, magma with crystallinity exceeding about 50 vol.{\%} and effective viscosity {\textgreater} 106 Pa s is generally perceived to stall in the Earth's crust rather than to erupt. There is, however, irrefutable evidence for colossal eruption of batholithic magma bodies and here we analyze four examples from Spain, Mexico, USA and the Central Andes. These silicic caldera-forming eruptions generated deposits characterized by i) ignimbrites containing crystal-rich pumice, ii) co-ignimbritic lag breccias and iii) the absence of initial fall-out. The field evidence is inconsistent with most caldera-forming deposits, which are underlain by initial fall-out indicating deposition from a sustained eruption column before the actual collapse sequence. In contrast, the documented examples suggest early deep-level fragmentation at the onset of eruption and repeated column collapse generating eruption volumes on the order of hundreds of cubic kilometers almost exclusively in the form of ignimbrites. These examples challenge our understanding of magma eruptability and eruption initiation processes. In this paper, we present an analysis of eruption promoters from geologic, theoretical and experimental considerations. Assessing relevant dynamics and timescales for failure of crystal-melt mush we propose a framework to explain eruption of batholithic magma bodies that primarily involves an external trigger by near-field seismicity and crustal failure. Strain rate analysis for dynamic and static stressing, chamber roof collapse and rapid decompression indicates that large "solid-like" silicic reservoirs may undergo catastrophic failure leading to deep-level fragmentation of batholithic magma at approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower strain rates than those characteristic for failure of crystal-poor magmas or pure melt. Eruption triggers can thus include either amplified pressure transients in the liquid phase during seismic shaking of a crystal-melt mush, decompression by block subsidence or a combination of both. We find that the window of opportunity for the eruption of large silicic bodies may thus extent to crystallinities beyond 50 vol.{\%} for strain rates on the order of {\textgreater} 10- 3 to 10- 4 s- 1. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Degassing processes in basaltic magmas rich in both water and carbon dioxide can be modeled using the solubilities of the endmember systems and the assumption of Henry's law. Suites of vapor-saturated basaltic melts having a range of initial CO2/H2O ratios and erupted over a narrow depth interval will define negatively sloped arrays on an H2O vs CO2 plot. It is important that all of the major volatile species be considered simultaneously when interpreting trends in dissolved volatile species concentrations in magmas.
Based on measured concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in basaltic glasses, the composition of the vapor phase at 1200°C that could coexist with a basaltic melt and the pressure at which it would be vapor saturated can be calculated. The range in vapor compositions in equilibrium with submarine basalts reflects the range in water contents in the melts characteristic of each environment. The ranges in the molar proportion of CO2 in vapor phases (X$\nu$CO2) calculated to be in equilibrium with submarine tholeiitic glasses are 0⋅93–1⋅00 for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), 0⋅60–0⋅99 for glasses from Kilauea [representative of ocean island basalts (OIB)] and 0–0⋅94 for glasses from back-arc basins (BABB). MORB glasses from spreading centers ranging from slow (e.g. the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) to fast (e.g. East Pacific Rise, 9–13°N) are commonly supersaturated with respect to CO2-rich vapor, resulting from magma ascent rates so rapid that magmas erupt on the sea-floor without having been fully degassed by bubble nucleation and growth during ascent. In contrast to the MORB glasses, volatile contents in submarine glasses from Kilauea are consistent with having been in equilibrium with a vapor phase containing 60–100 mol{\%} CO2 at the pressure of eruption, reflecting differences in average magma transport rates during eruptions at mid-ocean ridges and hotspot volcanoes.
Degassing during decompression of tholeiitic basaltic magma is characterized by strong partitioning of CO2 into the vapor phase. During open system degassing, CO2 is rapidly removed from the melt with negligible loss of water, until a pressure is reached at which the melt is in equilibrium with nearly pure water vapor. From this pressure downward, the water content of the melt follows the water solubility curve. During closed system degassing, water and CO2 contents in vapor-saturated basaltic magmas will depend strongly on the vapor composition as determined by the initial volatile concentrations. Deviation from open system behavior, toward lower dissolved H2O and CO2 saturation concentrations at a given pressure, will be greatest in melts having high total volatile concentrations and high CO2:H2O ratios. Closed system degassing of basaltic melts having the low initial H2O and CO2 contents typical of MORB and OIB, however, are similar to the open system case.},

These fines, which are available in plentiful supply, are a useful source of material and are important since they are a representative whole-rock sample of this complex meteorite. In addition, the fines give an indication of contamination sources which may affect not only the collected sawings but also the sawn surface of the meteorite. A number of contaminants were identified in the fines (e.g. organic materials, Teflon, diamond, and carbon associated with metal). It is considered that the levels of carbon contamination measured represent a worst possible case and hence provide a valuable reference with which to compare other analyses of this sample, or indeed, other Martian meteorites. Evidence was found for an indigenous carbonate component similar to that observed previously in other fractions of the meteorite. However, based on the results presented herein it is not possible to assert that isotopically distinct carbonate minerals of different origins are present in the meteorite. The levels of trapped Martian atmospheric CO2 calculated for the fines are unexpectedly high (∼1 ppm carbon), but this could be influenced by the presence of other, as yet unknown, carbonaceous materials.},

abstract = {Bayan Obo ore deposit is the largest rare-earth element (REE) resource, and the second largest niobium (Nb) resource in the world. Due to the complicated element/mineral compositions and involving several geological events, the REE enrichment mechanism and genesis of this giant deposit still remains intense debated. The deposit is hosted in the massive dolomite, and nearly one hundred carbonatite dykes occur in the vicinity of the deposit. The carbonatite dykes can be divided into three types from early to late: dolomite, co-existing dolomite-calcite and calcite type, corresponding to different evolutionary stages of carbonatite magmatism based on the REE and trace element data. The latter always has higher REE content. The origin of the ore-hosting dolomite at Bayan Obo has been addressed in various models, ranging from a normal sedimentary carbonate rocks to volcano-sedimentary sequence, and a large carbonatitic intrusion. More geochemical evidences show that the coarse-grained dolomite represents a Mesoproterozoic carbonatite pluton and the fine-grained dolomite resulted from the extensive REE mineralization and modification of the coarse-grained variety. The ore bodies, distributed along an E-W striking belt, occur as large lenses and underwent more intense fluoritization and fenitization. The first episode mineralization is characterized by disseminated mineralization in the dolomite. The second or main-episode is banded and/or massive mineralization, cut by the third episode consisting of aegirine-rich veins. Various dating methods gave different mineralization ages at Bayan Obo, resulting in long and hot debates. Compilation of available data suggests that the mineralization is rather variable with two peaks at ∼1400 and 440 Ma. The early mineralization peak closes in time to the intrusion of the carbonatite dykes. A significant thermal event at ca. 440 Ma resulted in the formation of late-stage veins with coarse crystals of REE minerals. Fluids involving in the REE-Nb-Fe mineralization at Bayan Obo might be REE-F-CO2-NaCl-H2O system. The presence of REE-carbonates as an abundant solid in the ores shows that the original ore-forming fluids are very rich in REE, and therefore, have the potential to produce economic REE ores at Bayan Obo. The Bayan Obo deposit is a product of mantle-derived carbonatitic magmatism at ca. 1400 Ma, which was likely related to the breakup of Columbia. Some remobilization of REE occurred due to subduction of the Palaeo-Asian oceanic plate during the Silurian, forming weak vein-like mineralization.},

abstract = {In this study we demonstrate that the combination of U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope data obtained by laser ablation-inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry provides a powerful tool for distinguishing zircon domains grown during several metamorphic or magmatic events from altered domains affected by complete single or multiple Pb-loss. This discrimination is possible because the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope systems are decoupled during zircon alteration. Initial 176Hf/177Hf once "incorporated" into the zircon lattice remains nearly unaffected during later alteration processes which cause Pb-loss. Zircon overgrowths always have higher initial 176Hf/177Hf than previously grown domains, due to the incorporation of additional radiogenic 176Hf formed by 176Lu decay in the rock's matrix between successive zircon growth events. Incorporation of such 176Hf into zircon domains affected by post-growth alteration is negligible. By applying the U-Pb and Lu-Hf systems, in combination with cathodoluminescence imaging, we show that zircon in the Sand River orthogneiss of the Limpopo Belt grew during magma crystallization at 3.28??Ga and anatectic events at 2.64??Ga and 2.02??Ga. Our data demonstrate that abundant zircon domains underwent multiple Pb-loss, and that many of the 2.02??Ga domains result from complete Pb-loss from zircon overgrowth domains already formed at 2.64??Ga. In contrast, all domains of complex zoned zircon grains from the Zanzibar granodiorite gneiss were formed during a single magmatic event at 2.61??Ga, as indicated by their uniform Hf isotope composition, but most subsequently suffered multiple Pb-loss. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fassaite is a major phase in Type B refractory inclusions and its wide compositional variability makes it an excellent recorder of crystallization-induced changes in liquid composition. Traverses across zoned crystals with electron and ion microprobes show that Ti, V, Sc, Zr and Hf decrease from core to rim, while Mg, Si, REEs, and other trace elements increase. Fassaite/liquid distribution coefficients derived from the compositions of early fassaite and calculated parent liquid compositions are higher than previously reported fassaite Ds, e.g., 0.2-0.8 vs. 0.08-0.5 for the trivalent REEs, possibly due to the high Ti and Al contents of the fassaite we analyzed. Log-log plots of concentrations of elements vs. those of Sc give linear relationships with slopes of ( D ̄ixl/L- 1)/( D ̄Scxl/L- 1), where D ̄ixl/L- is the bulk crystal/liquid distribution coefficient for element i. From this relationship, we derive effective fassaite/liquid Ds of 2.8 for Sc, 1.5 for Hf, 1.1 for Zr, 0.52 for Y, 0.34 for Ta, 0.29 for Nb, and 0.31-0.48 for trivalent REEs. The effective Ds are applicable to fassaite crystallizing from melts having the compositions and thermal histories of Allende Type B refractory inclusions, and incorporate any equilibrium and kinetic effects that modify Ds during the course of crystallization. Observed fassaite REE contents can be reproduced by a fractional crystallization model in which the effective Ds are used. Ti3+is more compatible in fassaite than Ti4+and, without equilibration of the residual liquid with an external reducing gas, Ti3+Titotratios (where Titot= Ti3++ Ti4+should decrease from core to rim in fassaite crystals. Comparison of profiles of Ti3+Titotratios in several crystals with those calculated for fractional crystallization suggests that the trend in one crystal was controlled by fractional crystallization alone, but in two others the virtually constant Ti3+Titotratios may imply that the liquids in these inclusions were able to maintain equilibrium with the solar nebular gas throughout crystallization. Attempts to determine the f{\{}hook{\}}o2of fassaite crystallization on the basis of Ti3+Titotratios must be based on fassaite grains which are not zoned with respect to Ti3+Titot. The range of observed REE abundances in subliquidus fassaite (7-800 × Cl for La and 30-2000 × Cl for Lu) now encompasses those in grains previously identified as relict, removing a major reason for their identification as such. Rounded fassaite grains with fairly sharp Mg-rich rims and Ti-rich cores, poikilitically enclosed in mantle melilite in TS34 are candidates for relict grains. The grains are so Scrich that they would require extreme prior crystallization of spinel and melilite, which is inconsistent with their very low REE contents (e.g., La at 3-7 × Cl).

abstract = {Oxygen fugacity (fO2) is an important parameter because it influences the crystallization sequences of magmas, as well as the composition of the resultant minerals. Traditionally fO2 has been estimated using coexisting Fe-Ti oxide compositions or Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios in silicate melts, for which the relationship between fO2 and Fe3+ has been calibrated. Problems arise in systems where oxides and/or glasses (melts) are absent, or when oxides are suspected to have been re-equilibrated. Therefore, it is important to develop alternate ways to look at fO2 in volcanic rocks. In this work, we describe a set of experiments to establish the relationship between the Fe3+ content of clinopyroxene and a basaltic melt as a function of oxygen fugacity. The starting bulk compositions were chosen to be representative of martian parental melts, with pyroxene (either augite or pigeonite) on their liquidi, in order for the results to be applicable to the martian meteorite magma source regions. Experimental conditions ranged from fO2 = IW to {\~{}}IW+8.6 at 1165 °C for pigeonite/melt pairs and at 1235 °C for melts alone, and fO2 = IW-1 to IW+4 at {\~{}}1190 °C for augite/melt pairs. Results show that Fe3+ varies from 0–65{\%} of the total Fe over this range of experimental conditions, and mass D (wt{\%}FePyx3+/wt{\%}Femelt3+) ranged from 0.75–1.44 and from 0.00–0.77, for pigeonite and augite respectively. XANES and M{\"{o}}ssbauer analytical methods give similar results within known error bars of the two techniques, with the best agreement in compositions with {\textgreater}10{\%} Fe3+. Our data show that only at high values of fO2 ({\textgreater}IW + 3.5, or ≈QFM) can Fe3+ distribution in pyroxene be used to estimate crystallization oxygen fugacity.},

abstract = {The major element chemistry and fluorine contents of biotites from the Gardar alkaline province of South Greenland provide an insight into the F contents of late-stage fluids associated with the magmatism. Biotites were taken from composite intrusions ranging from alkali gabbro to syenites, nepheline syenites and alkali granites. In each complex they show a large range of Fe/(Fe+Mg) (from 0⋅2 to ∼1) and exhibit strong Fe-F avoidance. There is considerable variation in F for any value of Fe/(Fe+Mg) but for each centre maximum F values plotted against Fe/(Fe+Mg) define a nearly straight line of characteristic slope towards low or zero F at pure annite. Micas in the SiO2 undersaturated centres have higher F contents than those from oversaturated centres. Cl is low (0⋅69 wt{\%}) except in the K{\^{u}}ngn{\^{a}}t intrusion, where it reaches 1⋅4 wt{\%}. Phase equilibrium and textural considerations suggest that most or all biotites grew subsolidus in a pervasive deuteric fluid. $\delta$18O values suggest that these fluids were largely magmatic in character and that extensive reactions with envelope fluids did not occur. Metasomatic resetting of F in biotites in early intrusive units in the aureole of later units can be demonstrated.$\backslash$nExperimental data of Munoz (Mineralogical Society of America, Reviews in Mineralogy 13, 469–494, 1984) were used to calculate families of curves showing variation in F with Fe/(Fe+Mg) for biotites in equilibrium with fluids of fixed fugacity ratio, f(HF)/f(H2O), at fixed P and T. The resulting curves cut sharply across the maximum fluorine lines observed in the natural examples. As it seems highly unlikely that changes in fluid composition and T, acting together, could produce the observed linear relationship, we conclude that the partitioning of F between fluid and mica in the plutonic environment is not well modelled by the experiments. Possible explanations are short-range order (SRO) of Fe and Mg on octahedral sites in biotite (Mason, Canadian Mineralogist 30, 343–354, 1992) or effects resulting from different F speciation in alkaline fluids. If perfect Fe-F avoidance is assumed, Fe-Mg SRO can increase maximum F content. The F levels seen in the silica-saturated centres are broadly consistent with a cooling-rate related control. It is possible that the higher F in biotites in the undersaturated centres reflects different speciation in the fluid rather than higher F contents, with strongly bound SiF4° complexes more common.},

abstract = {Chondrite normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of zircons generally have enriched Ce values relative to La and Pr, and depleted Eu values relative to Sm and Gd. High Ce contents in zircon may imply oxidizing conditions (Ce4+ is more compatible than Ce3+), whereas depleted Eu contents may imply reducing conditions (Eu2+ does not substitute into the zircon lattice). We report 41 experiments in which temperature, melt composition, and oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) were varied in order to explore the details of Ce and Eu incorporation into zircon. Crystals were synthesized in hydrous silicate melts at 10 kbar and 800–1300 °C. Synthetic rock mixes were doped with La + Ce + Pr (±P) or Sm + Eu + Gd and buffered at oxygen fugacities ranging from ∼IW (iron–w{\"{u}}stite) to {\textgreater}MH (magnetite–hematite); the run products were analyzed by electron microprobe to obtain crystal/melt partition coefficients. Cerium anomalies increase with higher oxygen fugacities and lower crystallization temperatures. In agreement with other experimental studies, peralkaline melts yield the largest zircon grains but show only modest Ce anomalies even at f O 2 s {\textgreater} MH. The same reason that zircons grown in peralkaline melts are easy to synthesize in the laboratory (these melts are capable of dissolving wt.{\%} levels of Zr before zircon saturation due to high alkali content) makes the melt structure/composition atypical and not representative of most natural magmas. With this in mind, we synthesized zircons in a granitic melt with more modest alkali contents that require geologically plausible Zr contents for saturation. We obtained the following empirical relationship: ln Ce Ce ∗ D = (0 . 1156 ± 0.0050 ) × ln( f O 2 ) + 13 , 860 ± 708 T(K) - 6.125 ± 0.484 where (Ce/Ce∗)D is the Ce anomaly in zircon calculated from partition coefficients, and T is the zircon crystallization temperature in K. Europium anomalies from the same melt composition are more negative at lower oxygen fugacities, but with no resolvable temperature dependence, and can be described by the following empirical relationship: Eu Eu ∗ D = 1 1 + 10 - 0.14 ± 0.01 × $\Delta$ NNO + 0.47 ± 0.04 where (Eu/Eu∗)D is the Eu partitioning anomaly and $\Delta$NNO is the difference in log units from the NNO buffer. If both Eu and Ce anomalies in zircons can be used as proxies for the oxidation state of Ce and Eu in the host melts, then it is clear that Eu2+ and Ce4+ can coexist in most zircon-saturated magmas. This implies that depletion of Eu melt contents by feldspar crystallization fractionation prior to (or during) zircon crystallization is not required to produce Eu anomalies. Thus, zircon Eu anomalies are a function of the oxygen fugacity and the Eu anomaly of the melt. Cerium anomalies of natural melts are not predicted to be as common because no major rock-forming phase depletes or enriches magmas in Ce compared to neighboring elements La and Pr. Thus, (Ce/Ce∗)D may be most readily applied to constrain the oxidation state of natural melts.},

abstract = {The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia is the most nickel-sulfide-endowed komatiite belt in the world. The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt contains two mineralised units/horizons that display very different volcanological and geochemical features. The Mt Keith unit comprises {\textgreater}500 m-thick spinifex-free adcumulate-textured lenses, which are flanked by laterally extensive orthocumulate-textured units. Spinifex texture is absent from this unit. Disseminated nickel sulfides, interstitial to former olivine crystals, are concentrated in the lensoidal areas. Massive sulfides are locally present along the base or margins of the lenses or channels. The Cliffs unit is locally {\textgreater}150 m thick and comprises a sequence of differentiated spinifex-textured flow units. The basal unit is the thickest, and contains basal massive nickel-sulfide mineralisation. The Mt Keith and Cliffs units display important common features: (i) MgO contents of 25–30{\%} in inferred parental magmas; and (ii) Al/Ti ratios of ∼20 (Munro-type). However, the Mt Keith unit is highly crustally contaminated (e.g. LREE-enriched, high HFSEs), whereas the Cliffs unit does not display evidence of significant crustal assimilation. We argue that the distinct trace-element concentrations and profiles of the two komatiite units reflect their different emplacement style and country rocks: the Mt Keith unit is interpreted to have been emplaced as an intrusive sill into dacitic volcanic units whereas the Cliffs unit was extruded as lava flow onto tholeiitic basalts in a subaqueous environment. The mode of emplacement and nature of country rock is the single biggest factor in controlling mineralisation styles in komatiites. On the other hand, evidence of crustal contamination does not necessarily provide information of the prospectivity of komatiites to host Ni–Cu–(PGE) mineralisation, despite being a good proxy for the style of komatiite emplacement and the nature of country rocks.},

Hf isotopes in detrital zircons from modern river deposits in Brazil, Australia, India and the Ukraine show evidence for production of juvenile crust at about 2.5 Ga. However, if detrital zircon populations in the 2.4-2.2 Ga time window are representative of the proportion of juvenile crust in their primary sources, they yield little evidence for significant volumes of juvenile crust of this age. Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircons from the Ukraine and eastern Australia also record production of juvenile continental crust between 1.65 and 1.40 Ga. Zircons from granitoids in south-central Laurentia and in western Brazil have EHf(T) values that fall near the depleted mantle growth curve recording production of juvenile continental crust in these regions between 1.5 and 1.3 Ga. Although Hf isotope compositions of detrital zircons can be useful in identifying detrital zircons derived from juvenile continental sources, the results do not necessarily equate to the volume of juvenile continental crust produced during specific time intervals. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The western part of the Khan Bogd complex, in the south Gobi desert, southern Mongolia, comprises (in order of emplacement): microcline-phyric granite, peralkaline aegirine-arfvedsonite granite (main intrusive phase) and aplite-pegmatite veins confined predominantly to the apical parts of the intrusion. These rocks are interpreted to represent products of extreme fractional crystallization involving alkali feldspar, quartz and, to a lesser extent, ferromagnesian silicates and, in the final stages of magma evolution, release of a silica-saturated orthomagmatic fluid. Geochemically, this evolutionary path involved an increase in peralkalinity index (from 1.0 in the porphyritic granite to 1.3 in the main phase to 2.5 in the pegmatite) and whole-rock Zr content (864 to 1130 to 16900 ppm, respectively). In the porphyritic granite, zircon with a low Hf content (Zr/Hf in the range 55-75) is the principal Zr phase, whereas alkali-Ca zirconosilicate minerals are characteristically absent. Zirconium mineral parageneses in the peralkaline granites and associated aplite-pegmatite bodies are texturally and compositionally complex products of Zr enrichment during the differentiation of magma, followed by reaction of the granitic rocks with a calcic CO 2-F-rich fluid. In the peralkaline unit and pegmatites, Ca-poor elpidite is an early magmatic host of Zr, along with appreciable levels of the rare-earth elements (n × 103 ppm REE + Y). The hydrothermal stage involved replacement of the primary elpidite by late-stage Ca-rich elpidite or armstrongite, and then precipitation of minor gittinsite and abundant zircon. With the exception of zircon [(La/Yb)CN ≈ 0.1], all secondary zirconosilicates exhibit relative enrichment in light REE [(La/Yb)CN in the range 0.3-5.0]. Enrichment of the light REE in the fluid due to the sequestration of heavy REE in zircon led to the deposition of light-REE fluorocarbonates associated with calcite and minor fluorite. The fluid probably separated at the final stages of the evolution of the peralkaline granitic magma, but a crustal input, indicated by Ca enrichment of the fluid, cannot be ruled out. The observed variations in the modal composition of the secondary paragenesis can be explained by changes in fluid regime, and the activity of silica and other dissolved species during the hydrothermal stage.},

The Guguan cross-chain in the intra-oceanic Mariana arc overlies subducted Jurassic Pacific plate lithosphere at depths of {\~{}}125--230 km and erupts mostly basalt. Basalts from rear-arc volcanoes are more primitive than those from the magmatic front, in spite of being derived by lower degrees of melting of less-depleted mantle. Rear-arc magmas also show higher temperatures and pressures of equilibration. Coexisting mineral compositions become more MORB- or OIB-like with increasing height above the subduction zone. Trace element and isotopic variations indicate that the subduction component in cross-chain lavas diminishes with increasing depth to the subduction zone, except for water contents. There is little support for the idea that melting beneath the Mariana Trough back-arc basin depleted the source region of arc magmas, but melting to form rear-arc volcanoes may have depleted the source of magmatic front volcanoes. Enrichments in rear-arc lavas were not caused by sediment melting; the data instead favor an OIB-type mantle that has been modestly affected by subduction zone fluids. Our most important conclusion is that sediment fluids or melts are not responsible for the K--h relationship and other cross-chain chemical and isotopic variations. We speculate that an increasing role for supercritical fluids released from serpentinites interacting with modestly enriched mantle might be responsible for cross-chain geochemical and isotopic variations.},

abstract = {Aluminous titanium-rich hedenbergite and Fe-rich augite were experimentally produced at 1050–1220 °C and 0.8–2.2 GPa. Major element compositions are analogous to clinopyroxene from layered intrusions, angrites, nakhlites, and late-stage lunar magma ocean cumulates. Trace element concentrations in pyroxene and coexisting melt were measured by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for rare earth elements (REE), high field strength elements (HFSE), transition metals, and large-ion lithophile elements. REE, HFSE, and transition metal partition coefficients (Ds) are tightly correlated with the cation abundance of Fe on the pyroxene M1 site ( X Fe M1 ), and also correlated with Al on the tetrahedral site ( X Al T ). Parameterized lattice-strain models were developed to predict REE and HFSE partition coefficients as functions of temperature and pyroxene composition ( X Al T or X Fe M1 ). The parameterized models can be used to calculate REE and HFSE partition coefficients for Fe-rich high-Ca pyroxene. We calculated partition coefficients for clinopyroxene derived from modeled end-stage lunar magma ocean cumulate compositions and observe a factor of 3 variation in clinopyroxene-melt REE partition coefficients. Using representative nakhlite clinopyroxene core and rim compositions we calculated partition coefficients and observed a factor of 4 variability in clinopyroxene-melt REE partition coefficients. HFSE partition coefficients are even more sensitive to composition, showing variations of a factor of 4 for lunar late cumulates and an order of magnitude for nakhlites. The strong dependence of REE and HFSE partitioning on composition necessitates careful selection of appropriate partition coefficients for Fe-rich systems.},

abstract = {Twenty six whole rocks, seven matrix and fifty three mineral separates from the compositionally zoned late Quaternary Laacher See tephra sequence (East Eifel, W Germany) were analyzed by instrumental neutron activation. These data document the chemical variation within the Laacher See magma chamber prior to eruption with a highly fractionated phonolite at the top and a more mafic phonolite at its base as derived from other data. Incompatible elements such as Zn, Zr, Nb, Hf, U, light and heavy rare earths are extremely enriched towards the top whereas compatible elements (e.g. Sr, Sc, Co, Eu) are strongly depleted. Semicompatible elements (Ta and some middle REE) are depleted at intermediate levels. This chemical variation is shown by whole rock and matrix data indicating the phonolite liquid was compositionally zoned regardless of phenocryst content. Hybrid rocks (phonolite-basanite) show the largest concentrations for compatible elements. All elements (except Rb) display continuous compositional variations with regard to the stratigraphic position of pumice samples. From these data we are able to distinguish three main units: An early erupted highly fractionated magma, the main volume of evolved phonolite and a mafic phonolite as the final products.The extreme variation of trace element distribution coef ficients (K) for 9 mineral phases with respect to stratigraphic position (resp. matrix composition) cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms. We postulate a significant modification of the trace element content of the phonolite melt by liquid-liquid controlled differentiation processes subsequent to and/or contemporaneous with (fractional) crystallization which caused disequilibrium between phenocrysts and host matrix. Therefore, our “distribution coefficients” deviate from equilibrium partition coefficients equivalent to the amount of this post crystallization modification of the matrix composition. The relationship between varying K and matrix composition is demonstrated by a $\Delta$K-$\Delta$M-diagram (variation of K versus variation of matrix, M). Different parts of this diagram relate to different parameters (T, P, polymerization, complex-building, equilibrium crystallization in a zoned magma column and post crystallization disequilibrium effects) which are responsible for the variation of distribution coefficients in general. The $\Delta$K-$\Delta$M-diagram may allow to distinguish between different processes affecting the distribution coefficients measured in natural volcanic rocks from a differentiating magma system.},

abstract = {Carbonatites found in strongly alkaline intra-plate petrographic volcanic provinces are associated with olivine-poor nephelinites and with phonolites. Olivine-rich nephelinites occur in basanitic and alkali basalt provinces, normally without carbonatites. These igneous provinces are marked by epeirogenic crustal uplift.Nephelinites, ijolites and carbonatites form discrete magmatic events within individual complexes and correspond to the silicate-carbonate conjugate immiscible liquids observed in the laboratory. Carbonate liquids of variable alkali content can separate from both nephelinitic and phonolitic liquids. The silicate liquids give rise to pyroxenites, ijolites, nepheline syenites and nephelinitic pyroclast-rich strato-volcanoes. The carbonate liquids lose alkalis and fractionate to s{\"{o}}vite, alvikite and ferrocarbonatite, each with increasing incompatible-element content. Further fractionation of carbonatite magma can produce mineralizing fluids rich in rare-earth elements, F, Ba, U and Th. Dolomite carbonatite forms only in the deeper parts of carbonatitic complexes, perhaps at depths greater than 2 km. Explosive carbonatite volcanism can occur giving widespread carbonate tuffs, rarely with lavas.Fenitization characterizes ijolite-carbonatite intrusive complexes. Syenitic fenites containing alkali feldspars, sometimes perthitic, are formed as aureoles 500 m wide around ijolites in granitic terranes, with nepheline syenite commonly formed as a contact-reaction rock. The feldspar-rich syneitic fenite aureoles which develop around the early carbonatites usually contain pure orthoclase or pure albite.},

abstract = {Since the onset of their eruptive activity within the Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera, about 180 ka ago, Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes have mainly produced lava flow eruptions of basaltic to phonoltic magmas. The products from these eruptions partially fill the caldera, and the adjacent Icod and La Orotava valleys, to the north. Although less frequent, explosive eruptions have also occurred at these composite volcanoes. In order to assess the possible evolution Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes and their potential for future explosive activity, we have analysed their recent volcanic history, assuming that similar episodes have the highest probability of occurrence in the near future. Explosive activity during the last 35000 years has been associated with the eruption of both, mafic (basalts, tephro-phonolites) and felsic (phono-tephrites and phonolites) magmas and has included strombolian, violent strombolian and sub-plinian magmatic eruptions, as well as phreatomagmatic eruptions of mafic magmas. Explosive eruptions have occurred both from central and flank vents, ranging in size from 0.001 to 0.1 km3 for the mafic eruptions and from 0.01 to {\textless} 1 km3 for the phonolitic ones. Comparison of the Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes with the previous cycles of activity from the central complex reveals that all them follow a similar pattern in the petrological evolution but that there is a significant difference in the eruptive behaviour of these different periods of central volcanism on Tenerife. Pre-Teide central activity is mostly characterised by large-volume (1-{\textgreater} 20 km3, DRE) eruptions of phonolitic magmas while Teide-Pico Viejo is dominated by effusive eruptions. These differences can be explained in terms of the different degree of evolution of Teide-Pico Viejo compared to the preceding cycles and, consequently, in the different pre-eruptive conditions of the corresponding phonolitic magmas. A clear interaction between the basaltic and phonolitic systems is observed from the products of phonolitic eruptions, indicating that basaltic magmatism is the driving force of the phonolitic eruptive activity. The magmatic evolution of Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes will continue in the future with a probably tendency to produce a major volume of phonolitic magmas, with an increasing explosive potential. Therefore, the explosive potential of Teide-Pico Viejo cannot be neglected and should be considered in hazard assessment on Tenerife. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Ditrău Igneous Complex (north-east Romania) is a tilted Mesozoic alkaline intrusion ({\~{}}19 km diameter), with enrichments in rare earth elements (REE), niobium, and molybdenum. It has the potential to contribute to a secure and sustainable European REE mining industry, ensuring supply security for these critical metals. The complex comprises a sequence of ultramafic rocks, alkali gabbros, diorites, syenites, nepheline syenites and alkali granites. These units have been significantly modified by sub-solidus interaction with late-stage magmatic fluids and are cut by secondary mafic dykes. The complex was subsequently cut by REE-mineralised carbonate-rich veins. Geochemical and petrological data, including apatite mineral chemistry, from the alkaline igneous rocks, dykes and veins within the Ditrău Complex, have been used to assess the interplay of magmatic processes with late-stage magmatic and hydrothermal fluids, and the effects of these processes on element remobilisation and concentration of critical metals. Only limited critical metal enrichment was achieved by magmatic processes; the REE were preferentially incorporated into titanite and apatite in ultramafic cumulates during primary crystallisation, and were not enriched in evolved magmas. A hydrothermal system developed within the Ditrău Complex magma chamber during the later stages of magmatic crystallisation, causing localised alteration of nepheline syenites by a sodium-rich fluid. Mafic dykes subsequently acted as conduits for late stage, buoyant potassic fluids, which leached REE and HFSE from the surrounding syenitic rocks. These fluids percolated up and accumulated in the roof zone, causing the breakdown of nepheline to K-rich pseudomorphs and the precipitation of hydrothermal minerals such as zircon and pyrochlore within veins. REE mineralisation within the Ditrău Complex is hosted in the latest hydrothermal phase, mineralised carbonate-rich veins, which cross-cut the complex. Monazite is the main REE-bearing phase, it crystallised from a late REE- and carbonate-rich fluid with pH controlled REE deposition.},

abstract = {The internal evolution of the Varutr{\"{a}}sk rare-element pegmatite (Skellefte District, Northern Sweden) has been investigated using stable isotope (B, H, O) geochemistry of tourmaline and coexisting micas, feldspar and quartz. Varutr{\"{a}}sk is a classic and typical example of highly fractionated LCT-type pegmatites, with a pronounced concentric zoning pattern composed of well-developed border, wall and intermediate zones and a quartz core. The pegmatite displays considerable rare-element enrichment, culminating in the formation of albite-lepidolite and pollucite units in the innermost zones. Major and trace element variations in tourmaline from the main pegmatite zones correlate well with the internal zoning pattern. Mineral compositions record an abrupt change in fractionation trends between the barren outer and intermediate zones and the inner, late-stage assemblages that carry rare-element mineralization. This change is also shown by the B-isotope variations of tourmaline. Early and mid-stage tourmalines record a systematic increase in $\delta$11B from − 14.6‰ to − 6.2‰ which can be explained by closed-system melt-mineral isotope fractionation whereby crystallization of large amounts of muscovite preferentially removes 10B from the residual melt. In contrast, tourmaline from late-stage assemblages in the inner zones and cross-cutting veinlets shows a reversal in the B isotope trend, with a decrease in $\delta$11B from − 8‰ to − 14.1‰. This reversal cannot be explained by mineral-melt isotope fractionation, but requires fluid-melt partitioning and partial fluid loss. Hydrogen isotope variations in mica support this model. The systematic increase in $\delta$D from − 75‰ in the outer zones (muscovite) to − 63‰ and − 53‰ in the inner zones (Li-micas) cannot be explained by closed-system variations in temperature or melt-mica fractionation, but it is consistent with late fluid exsolution. Oxygen isotope compositions of tourmaline ($\delta$18O from 9.7‰ to 11.6‰), quartz (13.3‰ to 14‰) and mica (10.3‰ to 11.3‰) show good agreement with equilibrium partitioning and yield temperatures in the range 450 °C to 600 °C. Combining this with the stability fields of Li-aluminosilicates petalite and spodumene indicates crystallization pressures of 2–3 kbar. Taken together, the stable isotope and mineral chemistry data demonstrate that rare-element enrichment in the innermost fractionated assemblages in the Varutr{\"{a}}sk pegmatite was associated with the transition from purely magmatic crystallization to conditions where a separate aqueous fluid phase became important.},

abstract = {The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex contains one of the world's largest concentrations of platinum-group elements (PGE). We have investigated ‘normal' reef, its footwall and its hanging wall at Impala Platinum Mines. The Reef is 46 cm thick and consists from bottom to top of leuconorite, anorthosite, chromitite and a very coarse-grained melanorite. The footwall is leuconorite and the hanging wall is melanorite. The only hydrous mineral present is biotite, which amounts to 1{\%}, or less, of the rock. All of the rocks contain 0{\textperiodcentered}1–5{\%} interstitial sulphides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite), with the Reef rocks containing the most sulphides (1–5{\%}). Lithophile inter-element ratios suggest that the magma from which the rocks formed was a mixture of the two parental magmas of the Bushveld Complex (a high-Mg basaltic andesite and a tholeiitic basalt). The Reef rocks have low incompatible element contents indicating that they contain 10{\%} or less melt fraction. Nickel, Cu, Se, Ag, Au and the PGE show good correlations with S in the silicate rocks, suggesting control of the abundance of these metals by sulphides. The concentration of the chalcophile elements and PGE in the silicate rocks may be modelled by assuming that the rocks contain sulphide liquid formed in equilibrium with the evolving silicate magma. It is, however, difficult to model the Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt concentrations in the chromitites by sulphide liquid collection alone, as the rocks contain 3–4 times more Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt than the sulphide-collection model would predict. Two possible solutions to this are: (1) platinum-group minerals (PGM) crystallize from the sulphide liquid in the chromitites; (2) PGM crystallize directly from the silicate magma. To model the concentrations of Os, Ir, Ru, Rh and Pt in the chromitites it is necessary to postulate that in addition to the 1{\%} sulphides in the chromitites there is a small quantity (0{\textperiodcentered}005{\%}) of cumulus PGM (laurite, cooperite and malanite) present. Sulphide liquids do crystallize PGM at low fS2. Possibly the sulphide liquid that was trapped between the chromite grains lost some Fe and S by reaction with the chromite and this provoked the crystallization of PGM from the sulphide liquid. Alternatively, the PGM could have crystallized directly from the silicate magma when it became saturated in chromite. A weakness of this model is that at present the exact mechanism of how and why the magma becomes saturated in PGM and chromite synchronously is not understood. A third model for the concentration of PGE in the Reef is that the PGE are collected from the underlying cumulus pile by Cl-rich hydrous fluids and concentrated in the Reef at a reaction front. Although there is ample evidence of compaction and intercumulus melt migration in the Impala rocks, we do not think that the PGE were introduced into the Reef from below, because the rocks underlying the Reef are not depleted in PGE, whereas those overlying the Reef are depleted. This distribution pattern is inconsistent with a model that requires introduction of PGE by intercumulus fluid percolation from below.},

Equilibrium was established by reversing the partition coefficient11The partition coefficient (KPRE) is defined as; ppm rare earth in “vapor” phase/ppm rare earth in glass.  and by betatrack autoradiography. Aqueous solution compositions were varied by adding different amounts of chloride and in some cases fluoride or carbon dioxide. The H2O contents of the Spruce Pine pegmatite melts were varied by conducting experiments at 4.0 kb, 800°C and at 1.25 kb, 800°C. A jadeite-nepheline composition (75 wt{\%} Jadeite) also was employed at 4.0 kb, 800°C. The chloride experiments (Spruce Pine 4 kb, 800°C) show a linear relationship between the cube of the chloride molality and the partition coefficients of the trivalent rare earths. Europium, under the experimental fO2 conditions (quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer), varied linearly as the fifth power of the chloride molality. At the chloride molalities examined ({\textless}1.1 mC1), all the rare earths partitioned preferentially into the melt phase (KPRE {\textless}1). Relative to pure water, the presence of chloride and fluoride fon increased the partitioning of the individual rare earths into the vapor phase, while carbon dioxide did not. Europium anomalies were recorded 1n all experiments, particularly those involving the Spruce P1ne melt at 4.0 kb and 800°C which displayed a large positive europium anomaly at all chloride molalities. Furthermore, a relative fractionation of the trivalent rare earths was also observed in these experiments, such that KPCe{\textgreater}KPGd{\textgreater}KPYb. The smaller ytterbium ion was consistently concentrated in the melt phase relative to the other rare earths in all experiments on the Spruce Pine composition. Experiments on the jadeite-nepheline composition showed no relative fractionation and a positive europium anomaly. The 1.25 kb experiment on the Spruce Pine composition showed a negative europium anomaly in plots of KpRE vs. REE. The overall rare earth partitioning at a constant chloride molality (mCl = .914) was such that KPSP(1.25 kb) {\textgreater} KPSP(4.0 kb) {\textgreater} KPJd-Ne(4.0 kb), where SP = Spruce Pine, Jd-Ne = jadeitenepheli Using the model of Burnnam (1975), It is suggested that the trivalent rare earth partitioning is related to the cube of the melt octahedral site concentration; a property which 1n hydrous melts 1s dependent on melt composition and hydroxyl molality. Excellent agreement was found for the Spruce Pine melt, whereas the jadeite-nepheline melt gave apparent hydroxyl molalities which were too high for the measured partition coefficient. Additional octahedral sites are proposed for this unusual composition perhaps due to some aluminum in 6-fold coordination. The apparent compositional variation of europium partitioning at a constant oxygen fugacity is believed to be related to both the octahedral melt site concentration for trlvalent europium and an 8-coordinated site concentration for divalent europium. Any parameter which affects the numbers of these sites (PH2O, melt composition) will affect the rare earth partitioning. The observed dependency of the partition coefficient on the structural state of the melt could be as significant as its dependency on crystalline structural constraints. Furthermore, since PH2O can drastically effect the melt structural state, its effects could be reflected in melt/crystal partition coefficients.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that control the accumulation of large silicic magma bodies in the upper crust is key to determining the potential of volcanoes to form caldera-forming eruptions. Located in one of the most populated regions on Earth, Camp Flegrei is an active and restless volcano that has produced two cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions and numerous smaller eruptive events over the past 60,000 years. Here, we combine the results of an extensive petrological survey with a thermomechanical model to investigate how the magmatic system shifts from frequent, small eruptions to large caldera-forming events. Our data reveal that the most recent eruption of Monte Nuovo is characterized by highly differentiated magmas akin to those that fed the pre-caldera activity and the initial phases of the caldera-forming eruptions. We suggest that this eruption is an expression of a state shift in magma storage conditions, whereby substantial amounts of volatiles start to exsolve in the shallow reservoir. The presence of an exsolved gas phase has fundamental consequences for the physical properties of the reservoir and may indicate that a large magma body is currently accumulating underneath Campi Flegrei.},

abstract = {A study of volcanic gas composition and matrix glass volatile concentrations has allowed a model for halogen degassing to be formulated for Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai'i. Volcanic gases emitted during 2004-2005 were characterised by a molar SO2/HCl of 10-64, with a mean of 33; and a molar HF/HCl of 0-5, with a mean of 1.0 (from approximately 2500 measurements). The HF/HCl ratio was more variable than the SO2/HCl ratio, and the two correlate weakly. Variations in ratio took place over rapid timescales (seconds). Matrix glasses of Pele's tears erupted in 2006 have a mean S, Cl and F content of 67, 85 and 173 ppm respectively, but are associated with a large range in S/F. A model is developed that describes the open system degassing of halogens from parental magmas, using the glass data from this study, previously published results and parameterisation of sulphur degassing from previous work. The results illustrate that halogen degassing takes place at pressures of {\textless} 1 MPa, equivalent to {\textless} {\~{}} 35 m in the conduit. Fluid-melt partition coefficients for Cl and F are low ({\textless} 1.5); F only degasses appreciably at {\textless} 0.1 MPa above atmospheric pressure, virtually at the top of the magma column. This model reproduces the volcanic gas data and other observations of volcanic activity well and is consistent with other studies of halogen degassing from basaltic magmas. The model suggests that variation in volcanic gas halogen ratios is caused by exsolution and gas-melt separation at low pressures in the conduit. There is no evidence that either diffusive fractionation or near-vent chemical reactions involving halogens is important in the system, although these processes cannot be ruled out. The fluxes of HCl and HF from Kīlauea during 2004-5 were {\~{}} 25 and 12 t/d respectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Trace element partitioning between clinopyroxene and melt was investigated experimentally under conditions appropriate to near-solidus melting of spinel lherzolite in the upper mantle. Starting material was a high-Na, Al basalt glass previously shown to be a very low degree (∼1{\%}) partial melt of spinel lherzolite at 1.5 GPa, 1269°C [Robinson et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., in press]. The experiment was run with a spinel seed under sub-liquidus conditions (1255°C) to ensure clinopyroxene crystallisation. The experimental clinopyroxene composition is consistent with equilibrium close to the solidus of fertile mantle lherzolite, most notably in its high contents of Ca-Tschermak's (CaTs) molecule (∼22 mol {\%}) and Na2O (1.4 wt{\%}). Clinopyroxene–melt partition coefficients (D) for a wide range of trace elements, determined by SIMS analysis of run products, differ markedly from those reported in other studies under conditions less appropriate to mantle melting. In particular partition coefficients for the heavy rare earth elements (Gd–Lu) are greater than unity (e.g. DLu=1.45), and the critical partitioning parameter, (DSm/DNd)×(DHf/DLu), is 0.68. These features, which arise due to the high CaTs content of the clinopyroxene, dramatically reduce the required involvement of garnet in the melting region beneath mid-ocean ridges.},

abstract = {The geochronological evolution of early Archaean Amitsoq gneisses from southern West Greenland is reassessed here using the well-established cathodoluminescence imaging method both to reveal previously undocumented complex zircon growth histories and to control positioning of ion-microprobe U-Th-Pb analyses. Several of the gneisses typically contain zircon grains with ??? 3.8 Ga cores of igneous origin, mostly completely mantled by growth banded magmatic zircon at ca. 3.65 Ga and in turn partly mantled by late Archaean metamorphic overgrowths at ca. 2.7 Ga. The ??? 3.8 Ga cores are regarded as inherited, with apparent dates ranging down to ca. 3.65 Ga reflecting differential Pb loss. This contrasts with published views interpreting ??? 3.8 Ga dates as emplacement ages of the host rock to the zircons, with all younger ages representing later Pb loss and / or metamorphic recrystallisation. Two of the analysed gneisses have discordant relationships to metasedimentary enclaves containing accessory apatite with graphite inclusions whose C-isotope ratios have been considered as biogenic in origin. The present data show that the minimum age of the enclaves is 3.65 Ga and not 3.85 Ga as previously claimed. This has important implications for the current debate on the possibility of temporal overlap of earliest life with a bolide impact scenario terminating at ??? 3.8 Ga (as on the moon). We also discuss the implication of the discovery of highly complex internal structures in Amitsoq gneiss zircons for the interpretation of published, zircon-derived Lu-Hf information.},

In garnet, Na can be explained by coupled substitution with P and Ti, and there is no need to invoke six-coordinated silicon. The Na distribution between garnet and clinopyroxene correlates with the Fe/Mg distribution for both eclogites and peridotites, and for the peridotites correlates with estimates of pressure and temperature from pyroxene composition. When calibrated experimentally, the Na distribution may be a useful indicator of physical conditions at depths for which the Fe/Mg distribution is insensitive; furthermore the Na distribution may be less sensitive to oxidation state.},

abstract = {Hourglass sector zoning, and related polar overgrowths, are common features of metamorphic tourmaline, developing as a result of variations in element preference on the different growth surfaces. For sector-zoned crystals, three domains are present for each growth zone (c +, c − and a), with compositional differences most distinct for Ca and Ti, and among c + and c − sectors. Intersector differences vary, commonly showing decreasing fractionation from core to rim attributed to increasing metamorphic grade. Here we show that intersector element partitioning is temperature dependent and derive empirical geothermometers based on c + –c − and c + –a partitioning of Ca and Ti. These thermometers are applicable over a range of temperatures and bulk-rock compositions. Intersector partitioning is not affected by re-equilibration and records and preserves complete T-histories of individual tourmaline grains from prograde to peak and on to retrograde growth. Information on element mobility is preserved by tourmaline composition, because intersector partitioning is independent of element concentration. These factors make intersector partitioning an ideal tool to elucidate the thermal history of tourmaline grains and thus their host environment and tourmaline's refractory nature preserves these signatures even into the sedimentary record.},

abstract = {The Hong'an region in the Qinling–Dabie collisional zone in eastern China hosts a series of metamorphic rocks exposing a south-to-north distribution from blueschist/blueschist–greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite (kyanite free) and kyanite–eclogite to coesite–eclogite facies rocks that represent progressively deeper levels of the Mesozoic subduction–collision complex. The Hong'an area is interesting for three reasons: (1) it escaped the thermal and structural overprint imparted on much of the Dabie Mountains during Early Cretaceous intrusion of voluminous granites and granodiorites; (2) the high-pressure (HP) Hong'an eclogites are widely distributed, often preserve prograde crystallization histories and can be directly linked in time and space to the blueschist/blueschist–greenschist rocks exposed to the south; (3) the blueschist/blueschist–greenschist facies rocks are generally better exposed than their equivalents in the southeastern Dabie Mountains and offer some opportunity for simultaneous structural and metamorphic analysis. The Hong'an area HP rocks offer perhaps the closest approximation to a preserved snapshot of Mesozoic pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions attending early subduction–exhumation in the region, and are thus essential to generating a coherent picture of the dynamics attending both metamorphism and exposure of the coeval ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks. The purpose of this contribution is twofold: (1) to document previously unpublished metamorphic and structural data characterizing these HP sequences and their relative continuity in Hong'an; (2) to incorporate these data with recent geochronologic, structural and paleomagnetic information in the context of protracted, late Paleozoic through Mesozoic subduction, collision and exhumation. Metamorphism and exhumation of some of the southern Hong'an HP sequences appear to have occurred concomitant with oceanic subduction immediately to the west, and thus may have preceded widespread continental subduction/collision. Moreover, all of the HP–UHP sequences in the region were exhumed before the end of collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons at ca. 160 Ma. Exhumation of HP–UHP rocks both before and during continental plate collision is neither novel for central China nor for other HP–UHP zones, but is important to take into account when reconstructing the evolution of such orogens.},

abstract = {An empirical model for solution of Ti in biotite is developed and calibrated on the basis of various equilibria among biotite and Ti-saturating assemblages. Sources of data used for the calibration include both experimental products and published analyses of natural assemblages. Ti solution in biotite can be satisfactorily modelled by means of the exchange component TiFe-2, whose non-ideal behavior can be approximated empirically by means of a linear function of the relative concentrations of Ti and octahedral Al in biotite. Within assemblages which fix the chemical potential of the exchange component TiFe-2, the concentration of this component in biotite is very sensitive to temperature and oxygen fugacity, making it possible to use biotite+oxide assemblages to obtain reliable T and f(O2) estimates in igneous and metamorphic rocks. In assemblages which also contain alkali feldspar, it is possible to use breakdown equilibria of Ti additive components in biotite to estimate H2O fugacity. Such uses are likely to find important applications in rocks in which other assemblages sensitive to temperature, f(O2) and/or f(H2O) are absent (in general, rocks containing a single oxide phase plus biotite as the only mafic silicate phase, ±alkali feldspar). The empirical model for solution of Ti in biotite also allows to calculate the loci of various terminal reactions for the assemblage titanian biotite+quartz, which, by comparison with equivalent equilibria in Ti-free systems, provide insight into the effect of Ti on the stability of biotite. Solubility of Ti in biotite increases with temperature in a strongly non-linear fashion. As a consequence, calculations predict that the effect of Ti on the stability of biotite is very small up to conditions typical of the beginning of the granulite facies of metamorphism, but beyond those conditions Ti concentration increases markedly and biotite is rendered very refractory. At mid to deep crustal pressures (≥ 10 kbar), the vapor-absent solidus of biotite+quartz in rocks containing Ti-saturating phases is likely to exceed 900°C, even in bulk compositions with subequal concentrations of Fe and Mg. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {We present a K-feldspar-liquid hygrometer specific to alkaline differentiated magmas that is calibrated through the regression analysis of sanidine and anorthoclase crystals coexisting with trachyte and phonolite melts. Partial-regression leverage plots were used to determine the minimum number of regression parameters that closely describe the variance of the dataset. The derived model was tested using K-feldspar-liquid pairs not included into the calibration dataset in order to address issues of systematic errors. When K-feldspar and plagioclase crystals coprecipitate from the same alkaline liquid under identical P-T-X-fO2-H2O conditions, the ability prediction of the new hygrometer is comparable to that of previous plagioclase-liquid models. To minimize the error of H2O estimate caused by the inadvertent use of disequilibrium data in natural samples, we have also calibrated a new test for equilibrium based on Or-Ab exchange between K-feldspar and coexisting melt. As an immediate application for both equilibrium and hygrometer models, we used as input data K-feldspar-liquid pairs from alkaline explosive eruptions at the Phlegrean Fields. The estimates of H2O dissolved in natural trachyte and phonolite magmas closely match those determined by melt inclusion analysis and H2O solubility modeling. This leads to the conclusion that our new models can significantly contribute to a better quantitative characterization of the H2O content in differentiated alkaline magmas feeding large-volume explosive eruptions.},

abstract = {Twelve zircon separates from diverse geological settings in peninsular India have been analyzed for their Zr, Hf, Sc, REE, Th and U contents employing neutron activation techniques. The whole rock samples of acid charnockite and a related rock of syenitic composition were also analyzed for these elements after separation of zircons. The study reveals that 1. a) the zircons exhibit a wide range of variation in elemental abudances and their ratios, 2. b) their chondritic normalised REE patterns exhibit negative or positive Ce and negative Eu anomalies in addition to smooth HREE enriched patterns without anomalies, and 3. c) there are significant differences in the REE partition coefficients of zircons from the charnockite and the associated syenite. The overall elemental abundances and REE patterns of the zircons could be explained in terms of crystallochemical factors, bulk compositional differences of parent melts and paragenetic histories.},

abstract = {The agpaitic nepheline syenites may, with regard to their elevated contents of a number of rare elements, be compared with the complex granite pegmatites. Both rock types form highly evolved magmas under closed system conditions which prevent volatiles from escaping.

Agpaitic rocks are peralkaline nepheline syenites characterized by the presence of complex rare-element minerals such as eudialyte and mosandrite, instead of the simple minerals such as zircon and ilmenite.

Uranium deposits have been found in agpaitic rocks in Brazil (Po{\c{c}}os de Caldas), China (Saima) and Greenland (Il{\'{i}}maussaq), Nb and apetite deposits in Russia (Lovozero and Khibina).

The type locality of agpaitic rocks, the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex in south Greenland, is characterized by elevated contents of elements such as Zr, REE, Y, Be, Li, Nb, U, Th and F, not only in pegmatites, late veins and contact fenites, but also in some of the rocks, especially lujavrite and kakortokite. The most important rare-element containing minerals are eudialyte (Zr, REE, Y, Nb), steenstrupine (U, Th, REE), rinkite (Nb, REE, Y, U), pyrochlore and perovskite (Nb, Ta), Li-mica (Li), chkalovite (Be) and villiaumite (F).

Occurrences of eudialyte-rich kakortokite and lujavrite are presently being explored in the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex as sources of Zr, REE + Y and Nb.},

abstract = {Major element, trace element and Nd-Sr-Pb-O isotope data for a suite of Neo-Proterozic, pre-orogenic, rift-related syenites from the Northern Damara orogen (Namibia) constrain their sources and petrogenesis. New U-Pb ages obtained on euhdreal titanite of inferred magmatic origin constrain the age of intrusion of the Lofdal and Oas syenites to ca. 750 Ma compatible with previous high-precision zircon analyses from the Oas complex. Major rock types from Lofdal and Oas are mildly sodic nepheline-normative and quartz-normative syenites and were primarily generated by fractional crystallization from a mantle-derived alkaline magma. Primitive samples from Lofdal and Oas show depletion of Rb, K and Th relative to Ba and Nb together with variable negative anomalies of P and Ti on a primitive mantle-normalized diagram. Evolved samples from Oas develop significant negative Ba, Sr, P and Ti anomalies and positive U and Th anomalies mainly as a function of crystal fractionation processes. The lack of a pronounced negative Nb anomaly in samples from Lofdal suggests that involvement of a crustal component is negligible. For the nepheline-normative samples from Lofdal, the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotope composition and low $\delta$18O values suggest derivation of these samples from a moderately depleted lithospheric upper mantle with crustal-like U/Pb ratios (87Sr/86Sr: 0.7031-0.7035, $\epsilon$ Nd: ca. + 1, $\delta$18O: 7‰,206Pb/204Pb: ca.18.00,207Pb/204Pb: 15.58-15.60). Primitive samples of the Oas quartz-normative syenites have identical isotope characteristics (87Sr/86Sr: 0.7034, $\epsilon$ Nd: ca. + 1, $\delta$18O: 6.5‰,206Pb/204Pb: ca.18.00,207Pb/204Pb: 15.59) whereas more differentiated samples have higher87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.709-0.714), slightly higher $\delta$18O values (7.0-7.1‰), less radiogenic $\epsilon$ Nd values (- 1.1 to - 1.4) and more radiogenic206Pb/204Pb ratios up to 18.27. These features together with model calculations using Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes suggest modification of a primary syenite magma by combined AFC processes involving ancient continental crust. In this case, high Nb abundances of the parental syenite liquid prevent the development of significant negative Nb anomalies that may be expected due to interaction with continental crust. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This layer is observed downdip of the inferred locked seismogenic zone, in the region of episodic tremor and slip. Laboratory velocity measurements of crystalline rock samples made at 200 MPa confining pressure and elevated pore pressures demonstrate that Vp/Vs increases with increasing fluid-filled porosity. The observed high Vp/Vs values are best explained by pore fluids under near lithostatic pressure in a layer with a high porosity of 2.7{\%}–4.0{\%}. Such large volumes of fluid take ∼1 m.y. to accumulate based on reasonable rates of metamorphic fluid production of ∼10−4 m3/(m2 yr) in subducting Juan de Fuca crust and mantle. Accordingly, the permeability of the plate interface at these depths must be very low, ∼10−24 to ∼10−21 m2, or the porous layer must have a permeability {\textless}3 × 10−20 m2.},

abstract = {The Cadomian-Hercynian basement of the Massif Central, France, contains both pre-metamorphic orthogneisses (600-410 Ma) and post-metamorphic undeformed granitoids (360-275 Ma). Major-, trace-element and Sr, Nd isotopic analyses of these intrusions indicate slight differences in source material for orthogneisses and two types of underformed granitoid: (a) granodiorite/monzogranites and leucogranites. Orthogneisses have moderately enriched REE patterns (LaYb=5.3−13.3), variable HREE contents (YbN=4.2−25) and strong negative Eu anomalies (EuEu∗=0.23−0.36). Their ∈tNd-values are low (−5.8 to −1.7), indicating a strong crustal component in the source but ∈tSr-values are also generally low (−25 to +100) and overlap the field of age-corrected isotopic values for lower-crustal granulite xenoliths from the Massif Central. The source of the orthogneisses is therefore considered to be dominated by a lower-crustal meta-igneous component with additional input from a lower-crustal metasedimentary source.

Granodiorites/monzogranites tend to show strong LREE enrichment (LaYb=11−26) with small Eu anomalies (EuEu∗=0.54−0.75) and YbN values between 6 and 8.5. These granitoids form the least evolved end-members of a series trending to highly evolved leucogranites with similar La/Yb ratios (11–36) but with generally larger Eu anomalies (EuEu∗=0.24−0.62) and lower YbN values (3–8). Initial isotopic ratios of the leucogranites (∈tNd = −7.9 to −4.5 and ∈tSr usually {\textgreater} +100) mostly fall within the field of age-corrected lower-crustal metasedimentary granulite xenoliths from the region and it is proposed that these leucogranites were formed by partial melting of lower-crustal metasediments. Granodiorites and monzogranites have ∈tNd between −6.5 and −3.4 and ∈tSr-values {\textless} + 100. These values are similar to those of meta-igneous and some metasedimentary lower-crustal xenoliths and thus the granodiorites/monzogranites may have been derived from a mixture of these two components with the meta-igneous component dominating.},

abstract = {Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) from the Indian Ocean are characterized by higher87Sr/86Sr and lower206Pb/204Pb, on average, than Atlantic and Pacific MORB. These distinct isotopic characteristics are thought to be the result of large-scale mantle contamination, either by ancient recycled sediments or delaminated subcontinental lithosphere. To constrain the upper mantle mixing end-members, we have analyzed the concentrations of Nb, U, Th, Pb and 17 other incompatible elements (by HPLC and ID-TIMS methods), as well as Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios in nine hand picked MORB glasses from the Central Indian and Carlsberg Ridge. Nb/U and Ce/Pb ratios are sensitive indicators of crustal contaminants in the mantle, and such contaminations have been identified in EM-type ocean island basalts. Here we show the first case of highly significant correlations of Nb/U, Ba/Nb and Ba/Th with87Sr/86Sr for Indian Ocean MORB and we confirm and strengthen a previously detected correlation with Ce/Pb (or Nd/Pb). These correlations are interpreted as residual heterogeneities that have not been completely rehomogenized by convective stirring of the mantle. The results are explained by a quantitative model involving contamination of an Atlantic-Pacific type upper mantle with a heterogeneous, recycled component consisting of ∼ 1.5 Ga old altered oceanic crust with small, but variable, amounts of ancient pelagic sediment added. This contamination causes higher87Sr/86Sr, lower143Nd/144Nd, generally low but variable206Pb/204Pb and the distinct trace element correlations seen in the Indian Ocean MORB data. Mass balance calculations show that only small amounts of pelagic sediment are necessary to satisfy the criteria of the contamination model, and these can be subducted within as little as 200 Ma. Lead isotopic systematics constrain the recycled sediment component to be older than about 1.25 Ga. Apart from this, the model does not constrain the age of the contamination event since the results are equally valid for (1) “slow” mixing of the recycled component subsequent to subduction at ∼ 1.5 Ga or (2) storage of the material after subduction in a mantle boundary layer followed by relatively recent reinjection into the MORB source and “fast” mixing.},

abstract = {We present the results of phase equilibrium experiments carried out on basanite and phonotephrite lavas from Ross Island, Antarctica. Experiments were designed to reproduce the P–T–X–fO2 conditions of deep and intermediate magma storage and to place constraints on the differentiation of each of the two predominant lava suites on the island, which are thought to be derived from a common parent melt. The Erebus Lineage (EL) consists of lava erupted from the Erebus summit and the Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP) lineage is represented by lavas sampled by drill core on Hut Point Peninsula. Experiments were performed in internally heated pressure vessels over a range of temperatures (1000–1150°C) and pressures (200–400 MPa), under oxidized conditions (NNO to NNO + 3, where NNO is the nickel–nickel oxide buffer), with XH2O of the H2O–CO2 mixture added to the experimental capsule varying between zero and unity. The overall mineralogy and mineral compositions of the natural lavas were reproduced, suggesting oxidizing conditions for the deep magma plumbing system, in marked contrast to the reducing conditions (QFM to QFM – 1, where QFM is the quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer) in the Erebus lava lake. In basanite, crystallization of spinel is followed by olivine and clinopyroxene; olivine is replaced by kaersutitic amphibole below ∼1050°C at intermediate water contents. In phonotephrite, the liquidus phase is kaersutite except in runs with low water content (XH2Ofluid {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}2) where it is replaced by clinopyroxene. Experimental kaersutite compositions suggest that the amphibole-bearing DVDP lavas differentiated below 1050°C at 200–400 MPa and NNO + 1{\textperiodcentered}5 to NNO + 2. Olivine- and clinopyroxene-bearing EL lavas are consistent with experiments performed above 1050°C and pressures around 200 MPa. The plagioclase liquidus at {\textless}1–2 wt {\%} H2O suggests extremely dry conditions for both lineages (XH2Ofluid approaching zero for EL, ∼0{\textperiodcentered}25 for DVDP), probably facilitated by dehydration induced by a CO2-rich fluid phase. Our results agree with previous studies that suggest a single plumbing system beneath Ross Island in which DVDP lavas (and probably other peripheral volcanic products) were erupted through radial fractures associated with the ascent of parental magma into the lower crust. The longer travel time of the DVDP lavas through the crust owing to lateral movement along fractures and the lack of a direct, sustained connection to the continuous CO2-rich gas flux that characterizes the main central Erebus conduit is probably responsible for the lower temperatures and slightly wetter conditions and hence the change in mineralogy observed.},

abstract = {Although it is well known that A-type granites are enriched in the rare earth elements (REE) and other high field strength elements (HFSE), the magmatic processes that concentrate these elements are still poorly understood. The 1.24 Ga Strange Lake pluton in northern Qu{\'{e}}bec-Labrador provides an extraordinary example of hyper-enrichment in the REE, Zr, and Nb in a peralkaline A-type granite. The pluton consists of two hypersolvus granite units (southern and northern) and a transsolvus granite, all of which contain perthitic alkali feldspar as the earliest major mineral; the transsolvus granite also contains separate albite and microcline crystals. Arfvedsonite, a sodic amphibole, occurs exclusively as phenocrysts in the transsolvus granite, whereas in the hypersolvus granite it is present as a late, interstitial phase. The primary HFSE minerals are zircon, monazite-(Ce), gagarinite-(Ce) and the pyrochlore group minerals. Magma evolution was monitored by the alumina content in the bulk rock, which decreases from the southern to the northern hypersolvus granite and is lowest in the transsolvus granite. Alkalinity indices and bulk Si, Fe, Rb, REE, Zr, Nb concentrations show the opposite trend. Alkali feldspar compositions mirror the trend shown by the bulk rock, i.e., decreasing Al contents are accompanied by increasing Si, Fe3+, REE, Zr and Nb contents. The major driving forces for the evolution of the hypersolvus magma prior to emplacement were the early separation of a fluoride melt from the silicate melt and the crystallization of alkali feldspar and HFSE-rich phases (zircon, monazite-(Ce), pyrochlore group). An alkali feldspar-rich crystal-mush containing LREE-fluoride melt droplets was emplaced as the least evolved southern hypersolvus granite. Massive fractionation of alkali feldspar led to a sharp increase in ƒH2O and F−activity in the magma chamber that triggered the crystallization of arfvedsonite and was followed by emplacement of the northern hypersolvus granite, which contained a higher proportion of LREE-fluoride melt droplets. Further evolution in the magma chamber led to a transition from a miaskitic to an agpaitic composition. The transsolvus granite was intruded in the form of a low viscosity crystal mush of alkali feldspar, quartz, arfvedsonite (after appreciable crystallization of arfvedsonite) and LREE-fluoride melt droplets. Upon emplacement, arfvedsonite (and gagarinite-(Ce)) crystals segregated as cumulates in response to a combination of flow differentiation and gravity settling. The immiscible fluoride melt accumulated in a volatile-rich residual silicate magma, which migrated to the top of the pluton where it formed the F-REE-rich cores of highly mineralized pegmatites.},

abstract = {We have studied the influence of Ca-Tschermaks (Calcium Tschermaks or CaTs) content of clinopyroxene on the partitioning of trace elements between this phase and silicate melt at fixed temperature and pressure. Ion probe analyses of experiments carried out in the system Na2O–CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2, at 0.1 MPa and 1218°C, produced crystal-melt partition coefficients (D) of 36 trace elements (Li, Cl, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, In, Sn, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta and W), for clinopyroxene compositions between 10 and 32 mol{\%} CaTs. Partition coefficients for 2+ to 5+ cations show, for each charge, a near parabolic dependence of log D on ionic radius of the substituting cation, for partitioning into both the M1 and M2 sites of clinopyroxene. Fitting the results to the elastic strain model of Blundy and Wood [Blundy, J.D., Wood, B.J., 1994. Prediction of crystal-melt partition coefficients from elastic moduli. Nature 372, 452–454] we obtain results for the strain-free partition coefficients of theoretical cations (D0), with site radius r0, and for the site's Young's Modulus (E). In agreement with earlier data our results show that increasing ivAl concentration in cpx is matched by increasing D, EM1, EM2 and D0 for tri-, tetra- and pentavalent cations. The degree of fractionation between chemically similar elements (i.e. Ta/Nb, Zr/Hf) also increases. In contrast, D values for mono-, di- and hexavalent cations decrease with increasing ivAl in the cpx. The large suite of trace elements used has allowed us to study the effects of cation charge on D0, r0 and E. We have found that D0 and r0 decrease with increasing cation charge, e.g. r0=0.66 {\AA} for 4+ cations and 0.59 {\AA} for 5+ cations substituting into M1. Values of EM1 and EM2 increase with cation charge as well as with increasing ivAl content. The increase in EM2 is linear and close to the trend set by Hazen and Finger [Hazen, R.M., Finger, L.W., 1979. Bulk modulus-volume relationship for cation–anion polyhedra. J. Geophys. Res. 84 (10) 6723–6728] for oxides. EM1 values are much higher and do not fit the trend predicted by the Hazen and Finger relationship.},

abstract = {The effects of crystal chemistry and melt composition on the control of clinopyroxene/melt element partitioning (D) during the assimilation of olivine/peridotite by felsic magma have been investigated in Mesozoic high-Mg diorites from North China. The assimilation resulted in significant increase of Mg, Cr and Ni and only slight ({\textless}30{\%}) decrease of incompatible elements of the magma, and the compositional variations have been mirrored by the normally and reversely zoned clinopyroxene microphenocrysts formed at the early stage of the magma evolution. The Mg{\#} [100×Mg/(Mg+Fe)] values of the reversely zoned clinopyroxenes increase from 65 to 75 in the core to 85-90 in the high-Mg midsection, and reduce back to 73-79 at the rim. Trace element profiles across all these clinopyroxene domains have been measured by LA-ICP-MS. The melt trace element composition has been constrained from bulk rock analyses of the fine-grained low- and high-Mg diorites. Clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients for rare earth elements (REE) and Y in the high-Mg group zonings (Mg{\#}{\textgreater}73-79, DDy{\textless}1.2) are positively correlated with tetrahedralIVAl and increase by a factor of 3-4 as tetrahedralIVAl increases from 0.01 to 0.1 per formula unit (pfu). These systematic variations are interpreted to be controlled by the clinopyroxene composition. In contrast, partition coefficients for low-Mg group zonings (Mg{\#}{\textless}75-79, DDy{\textgreater}1.2) are elevated by up to an order of magnitude (for REE and Y) or more (for Zr and Hf) at similarIVAl, indicating dominant control of melt composition/structure. DZrand DHfshow a larger sensitivity to the compositional change of crystal and melt than DREE. DTivalues for the low- and high-Mg zonings show a uniform dependence onIVAl. DSrand DLiare insensitive to the compositional change of clinopyroxene and melt, resulting in Sr depletions in the clinopyroxene zonings with elevated REE without crystallization of plagioclase. Our observations show that crystal chemistry and melt composition/structure may alternatively control clinopyroxene/melt partitioning during the assimilation of peridotite by felsic magma, and may be useful for deciphering clinopyroxene compositions and related crust-mantle processes.},

abstract = {CALCMIN, an open source Visual Basic program, was implemented in EXCEL???. The program was primarily developed to support geoscientists in their routine task of calculating structural formulae of minerals on the basis of chemical analysis mainly obtained by electron microprobe (EMP) techniques. Calculation programs for various minerals are already included in the form of sub-routines. These routines are arranged in separate modules containing a minimum of code. The architecture of CALCMIN allows the user to easily develop new calculation routines or modify existing routines with little knowledge of programming techniques. By means of a simple mouse-click, the program automatically generates a rudimentary framework of code using the object model of the Visual Basic Editor (VBE). Within this framework simple commands and functions, which are provided by the program, can be used, for example, to perform various normalization procedures or to output the results of the computations. For the clarity of the code, element symbols are used as variables initialized by the program automatically. CALCMIN does not set any boundaries in complexity of the code used, resulting in a wide range of possible applications. Thus, matrix and optimization methods can be included, for instance, to determine end member contents for subsequent thermodynamic calculations. Diverse input procedures are provided, such as the automated read-in of output files created by the EMP. Furthermore, a subsequent filter routine enables the user to extract specific analyses in order to use them for a corresponding calculation routine. An event-driven, interactive operating mode was selected for easy application of the program. CALCMIN leads the user from the beginning to the end of the calculation process. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston 2017. The 2060 Ma old Palabora Carbonatite Complex (PCC), South Africa, comprises diverse REE mineral assemblages formed during different stages and reflects an outstanding instance to understand the evolution of a carbonatite-related REE mineralization from orthomagmatic to late-magmatic stages and their secondary post-magmatic overprint. The 10 rare earth element minerals monazite, REE-F-carbonates (bastn{\"{a}}site, parisite, synchysite), ancylite, britholite, cordylite, fergusonite, REE-Ti-betafite, and anzaite are texturally described and related to the evolutionary stages of the PCC. The identification of the latter five REE minerals during this study represents their first described occurrences in the PCC as well as in a carbonatite complex in South Africa. The variable REE mineral assemblages reflect a multi-stage origin: (1) fergusonite and REE-Ti-betafite occur as inclusions in primary magnetite. Bastn{\"{a}}site is enclosed in primary calcite and dolomite. These three REE minerals are interpreted as orthomagmatic crystallization products. (2) The most common REE minerals are monazite replacing primary apatite, and britholite texturally related to the serpentinization of forsterite or the replacement of forsterite by chondrodite. Textural relationships suggest that these two REE-minerals precipitated from internally derived late-magmatic to hydrothermal fluids. Their presence seems to be locally controlled by favorable chemical conditions (e.g., presence of precursor minerals that contributed the necessary anions and/or cations for their formation). (3) Late-stage (post-magmatic) REE minerals include ancylite and cordylite replacing primary magmatic REE-Sr-carbonates, anzaite associated with the dissolution of ilmenite, and secondary REE-F-carbonates. The formation of these post-magmatic REE minerals depends on the local availability of a fluid, whose composition is at least partly controlled by the dissolution of primary minerals (e.g., REE-fluorocarbonates). This multi-stage REE mineralization reflects the interplay of magmatic differentiation, destabilization of early magmatic minerals during subsequent evolutionary stages of the carbonatitic system, and late-stage fluid-induced remobilization and re-/precipitation of precursor REE minerals. Based on our findings, the Palabora Carbonatite Complex experienced at least two successive stages of intense fluid-rock interaction.},

abstract = {We report new Nd, Hf, Sr, and high-precision Pb isotopic data for 44 lava and tephra samples from Erebus volcano. The samples cover the entire compositional range from basanite to phonolite and trachyte, and represent all three phases of the volcanic evolution from 1.3 Ma to the present. Isotopic analyses of 7 samples from Mt. Morning and the Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP) are given for comparison. The Erebus volcano samples have radiogenic 206Pb/204Pb, unradiogenic 87Sr/86Sr, and intermediate 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf, and lie along a mixing trajectory between the two end-member mantle components DMM and HIMU. The Erebus time series data show a marked distinction between the early-phase basanites and phonotephrites, whose Nd, Hf, Sr, and Pb isotope compositions are variable (particularly Pb), and the current ‘phase-three' evolved phonolitic lavas and bombs, whose Nd, Hf, Sr, and Pb isotope compositions are essentially invariant. Magma mixing is inferred to play a fundamental role in establishing the isotopic and compositional uniformity in the evolved phase-three phonolites. In-situ analyses of Pb isotopes in melt inclusions hosted in an anorthoclase crystal from a 1984 Erebus phonolite bomb and in an olivine from a DVDP basanite are uniform and identical to the host lavas within analytical uncertainties. We suggest that, in both cases, the magma was well mixed at the time melt inclusions were incorporated into the different mineral phases.},

abstract = {The Merensky pegmatoid (normal reef) in the western Bushveld Complex is commonly characterized as a pyroxene-rich pegmatoidal unit with a base that is enriched in chromite and platinum-group element-bearing sulfides overlying a leuconorite footwall. Models for its formation have ranged from those that view it as entirely a magmatic cumulate succession to those that have suggested that it is a zone of volatile-induced remelting. The consequences of the latter interpretation are investigated using the numerical modeling program IRIDIUM, which links diffusive and advective mass and heat transport with a phase equilibration routine based on the MELTS program. The initial system consists of a simple stratigraphic succession of a partially molten leuconorite overlain by a partially molten pyroxenite, both initially at 1,190°C and 2 kbar. 2 wt{\%} of a volatile fluid composed of 75 mol{\%} H2O, 20 mol{\%} CO2 and 5 mol{\%} H2S is then added to the lower 20 cm of the pyroxenite. The system is then allowed to evolve under conditions of chemical diffusion in the liquid. The addition of the volatile components results in a modest increase in the amount of melt in the pyroxenite. However, chemical diffusion across the leuconorite–pyroxenite boundary leads to more extensive melting at and below the boundary with preferential loss of opx from the underlying leuconorite, preferential re-precipitation of sulfide and chromite and concentration of the PGE at this boundary. These results mimic actual mineral and compositional profiles across the Merensky pegmatoid and illustrate that long-term diffusion process can effectively produce mineralogical and compositional layering not present in the original assemblage.},

Some workers have used isotopic compositions to infer mixed mantle plume type sources such as EM1, HIMU and FOZO, implying derivation from the subcontinental asthenosphere. Other models favour an entirely lithospheric source, whereby the magmas, originally formed during intracontinental rifting, became deformed and subducted into the mantle lithosphere during later continental collisions, and constituted part of a source component for later rift-related alkaline and carbonatite magmatism.

abstract = {Paresis is one of a group of Cretaceous ring complexes extending from the coast some 350 km NE across the Damara Belt. It consists of over 90{\%} rhyolites and comendites, with subordinate intrusions of quartz syenite and alkali-feldspar syenite. These felsic units are accompanied by very minor amounts of silica-undersaturated basalt, phonolite and lamprophyre. Located near the edge of the Congo Craton, Paresis is the farthest inland of any felsic complex in the Cretaceous ring complex group. The other ring complexes in the vicinity consist of carbonatites and undersaturated alkaline rocks (e.g., Okorusu, Kalkfeld, Etaneno, Ondurakorume). Geochemical and isotopic data provide evidence for both mantle and crustal components in the sources of the Paresis magmas. The alkaline basalts, phonolite and lamprophyre have overlapping Sr and Nd isotopic initial ratios which plot within the mantle array close to bulk-earth values ($\epsilon$Nd = -0.9 to -2.8 and87Sr/86Sr(i) = 0.7042-0.7054) and may indicate a mantle plume component. The rhyolite units comprise metaluminous feldspar rhyolites and peraluminous, more differentiated quartz-feldspar rhyolites. Both units show prominent negative Nb and Ta anomalies on mantle-normalized multielement diagrams and have extremely nonradiogenic Nd ratios ($\epsilon$Nd = -21) and Sr initial ratios of 0.7117-0.7138. These isotopic values suggest a crustal origin from pre-Damara (Early Precambrian) gneisses and granitoids, which are exposed in the Congo craton and related inliers in northern Namibia. The comendites are peralkaline, highly differentiated rocks. In contrast to the rhyolites, comendites lack mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies, have higher HFSE and LREE contents, extreme negative Eu anomalies and $\epsilon$Nd values of -11. Like the comendites, alkali-feldspar syenites are peralkaline, lack Nb and Ta anomalies, have negative Eu anomalies and high HFSE concentrations. Their $\epsilon$Nd values are -6.5 to -8. The quartz syenites overlap with the peralkaline units in isotopic composition but they are chemically very different. They are metaluminous, have a low degree of differentiation and have prominent negative mantle-normalized Nb and Ta anomalies like the rhyolites. The Sr-Nd isotopic composition and incompatible element ratios of the comendites, quartz syenites and alkali-feldspar syenites are intermediate between those of the rhyolites and basalts, precluding a simple origin by basalt fractionation or crustal melting. Instead, the data indicate that the comendite and syenites formed from hybrid magmas with both crustal and mantle-derived components. The metaluminous quartz syenites can be modelled by assimilation of pre-Damara crust by basaltic magma. The peralkaline nature and trace element characteristics of comendite and alkali-feldspar syenites, on the other hand, require an alkaline and HFSE-enriched basic endmember, whose fractionated equivalent may be the Paresis phonolite.

abstract = {We have experimentally determined the partition coefficients of rare earth elements (REE), HFSE (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) and other trace elements between clinopyroxene and potassic silicate melts at 0.1-200 MPa and 1042-1140??C. The major and trace element contents of clinopyroxene and liquid were determined by electron probe and ion microprobe, respectively. The liquidus clinopyroxenes are extremely rich in Al2O3 (up to 12{\%}) and Fe2O3, which enables us to test suggestions that partition coefficients of HFSE and REE depend on the Al content of the clinopyroxene (e.g., Lundstrom, C.C., Shaw, H.F., Ryerson, F.J., Williams, Q., Gill, J., 1998. Crystal chemical control of clinopyroxene-melt partitioning in the Di-Ab-An system: implications for elemental fractionations in the depleted mantle. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 62, 2849-2862.). When compared with previous data for low-alumina clinopyroxene crystallised under similar P-T conditions, the increase in weight partition coefficient Di (= [I]xtl/[I]liq) for all the HFSE and REE is dramatic. For Ti and the REE, partition coefficients increase by about one order of magnitude as Aliv concentration of clinopyroxene increases from 0.02 to 0.5. For Nb, Ta and Zr, the effect is even more pronounced, a two order of magnitude increase being found to correspond to this increase in Aliv. We applied the data to model the fractionation of historic lavas from Vesuvius. Previous work using the major elements (Belkin, H.E., Kilburn, C.R.J., DeVivo, B., 1993.

abstract = {We present a quantitative model for Na partitioning between clinopyroxene and silicate melt, applicable in the range 0.1 MPa to 6.0 GPa, 1000–2000°C over a wide span of composition. Our model is derived from the Jadeite melting equilibrium, via the relationship $\Delta$Gƒ(P,T) = −RTlnKƒ = RTlnD*Na where $\Delta$Gƒ(P,T) is the Gibbs free energy of fusion of Jadeite at the pressure (P) and temperature (T) of interest, T is in kelvins, R is the gas constant, Kƒ is the equilibrium constant for the the melting reaction and D*Na is a molar partition coefficient, defined here as the molar ratio of Na in crystal to Na in melt on a six-oxygen basis. An expression for $\Delta$Gƒ(P,T) is obtained from published experimental data on the Jadeite melting curve from 2.8 to 16.5 GPa, combined with available (or estimated) thermochemical data for jadeite crystal and Jadeite melt. The model is tested against: (1) new experimental data in the system diopside-albite from 0.1 MPa to 6.0 GPa; (2) new analyses of clinopyroxene and glass from the mid-ocean ridge basalt-pyrolite sandwich experiments of Falloon and Green (1988); and (3) published experimental data from natural and synthetic systems. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data over the entire P–T range investigated. The only systematic deviations occur in oxidizing systems (ƒO2 {\textgreater} FMQ + 1), due to stabilization of the NaFe3 + Si2O6 (acmite) component in clinopyroxene, and on the diopside-albite join at 0.1 MPa. The latter can be quantitatively ascribed to nonideality of melts on the diopside-silica join in the system CaMgSi2O6-NaAlSi2O6-Si3O6. The activity-composition relationships adopted for crystal and melt do not require prior knowledge of the aluminum content of either phase. As D*Na is typically within 3{\%} relative of the weight partition coefficient (DNa) our thermodynamic model provides a quantitative description of Na partitioning between clinopyroxene and melt in the upper mantle.},

abstract = {The covariant behavior of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopes during most magmatic processes has long been recognized, but the details of this behavior in the depleted mantle reservoir have not been adequately examined. We report new whole-rock Hf and Nd isotope data for 1) juvenile, mantle-derived rocks, mid-Archean to Mesozoic in age, and 2) early Archean gneisses from West Greenland. Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of the juvenile rocks are well correlated, with the best fit corresponding to the equation $\epsilon$Hf = 1.40 $\epsilon$Nd + 2.1, and is similar to the collective Hf-Nd correlation for terrestrial samples of $\epsilon$Hf = 1.36 $\epsilon$Nd + 3.0. The early Archean Greenland gneisses, in contrast, have an extreme range in $\epsilon$Nd values (−4.4 to +4.2; Bennett et al., 1993) that is not mirrored by the Hf isotopic system. The $\epsilon$Hf values for these rocks are consistently positive and have much less variation (0 to +3.4) than their $\epsilon$Nd counterparts. The information from the Hf isotopic compositions of the West Greenland gneisses portrays an early Archean mantle that is relatively isotopically homogeneous at 3.8 to 3.6 Ga and moderately depleted in incompatible elements. There is no evidence that any of these gneisses have been derived from an enriched reservoir. The Hf isotopic data are in stark contrast to the Nd isotopic record and strongly imply that the picture of extreme initial isotopic heterogeneity indicated by Nd isotopes is not a real feature of the West Greenland gneisses but is rather an artifact produced by disturbances in the Sm-Nd isotope system of these rocks. Although Hf and Nd isotopic data do not uniquely constrain either the nature of the earliest crust or the timing of crustal growth, the most probable candidate for the enriched reservoir complementary to the depleted mantle in the pre-4.0 Ga Earth is a mafic, oceanic-type crust. In order to explain the predominantly positive $\epsilon$Hf and $\epsilon$Nd values for the early Archean rocks, this crust must have had a short residence time at the surface of the Earth before returning to the mantle where it was isolated from mixing with the depleted mantle for several hundred million years. The following period from 3.5 to 2.7 Ga may mark a transition during which this early formed mafic crust was mixed progressively back into the depleted mantle reservoir. While a present-day volume of continental crust at 4.0 Ga cannot be excluded on isotopic grounds, we find such a scenario unlikely based on the lack of direct isotopic and physical evidence for its existence. An important aspect of crustal growth and evolution, therefore, may be the transformation of the enriched reservoir from being predominantly mafic in the early Earth to becoming progressively more sialic through time.},

abstract = {Several cycles of initially mafic to progressively felsic activity have given rise to large volume felsic deposits on Tenerife that serve as prime examples of pronounced magmatic differentiation in an ocean island setting. The Teide–Pico Viejo succession is the most recent of these cycles to show a systematic evolution from initially basanitic to phonolitic eruptions. Basanite lava flows bear olivine, pyroxene and occasionally plagioclase, while phonolites mainly display alkali feldspar with subordinate pyroxene, amphibole, biotite and oxides. Three groups of eruptives can be discerned based on their trace element composition: (1) Mafic lavas that show typical OIB signatures, (2) Transitional lavas, which are enriched in incompatible trace elements but may be depleted in Ba and Sr and (3) Phonolites, which are more enriched in incompatible trace elements, but show the strongest negative Ba and Sr anomalies. Linking the spatio-chronological distribution of eruptions with these compositional groups shows a progressive migration of mafic activity from the outskirts of the rift zones towards the central complex over the last 30 ka. The arrival of mafic activity at the central complex coincided with the onset of more evolved eruptions at Teide, thought to be triggered by mafic underplating. The distribution of mafic activity at the surface may thus be related to the volume of mafic underplating beneath the volcanic edifice at a given time.},

abstract = {Field observations, petrography and magnetic susceptibility fabrics are used to characterize the structure and evolution of the Nebo granite, forming part of the Bushveld Complex, in South Africa. The Nebo granite is the dominant component of the Lebowa granite suite, the largest known anorogenic granitoid complex. It is a composite tabular intrusion, comprising alkali feldspar granites and syenogranites. There are seven main petrographic units, defined by differences in modal content, crystallization sequence, magmatic water content, magnetic susceptibility and magnetic fabric. Each unit was emplaced independently and fed by vertical dykes. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility used to map magmatic fabrics within the granite shows that they are dominantly controlled by alignment of early-crystallizing magnetite and are similar in outcrop and pluton scale. Magnetic foliations and lineations are horizontal, reflecting vertical host-rock compression and horizontal magma flow during emplacement. Space was created by magma pressure which resulted in roof uplift and floor depression: displacements were accommodated by normal and reverse faulting and flexural-slip along bedding planes in host-rock metasediments.},

abstract = {We consider the origin of rhyolites associated with tholeiitic basalt in bimodal provinces, as exemplified by the Rattlesnake Tuff of the High Lava Plains of eastern Oregon, in comparison to rhyolites associated with calcalkaline suites in light of recent models of extraction of rhyolite from crystal mush (Hildreth, J Volcanol Geotherm Res, 136:169-198, 2004; Bachmann and Bergantz, J Petrol, 45:1565-1582, 2004). The High Lava Plains encompass a strongly bimodal, tholeiite-rhyolite suite, spatially and compositionally related to the Snake River Plain and Yellowstone Plateau. In our assessment we draw the distinction between fractionation dominated processes to make rhyolites from rhyolites and processes required to make the parental rhyolite melt. New isotopic data and compositional zoning profiles in phenocrysts confirm that crystal fractionation dominated the generation of progressively more evolved, discrete rhyolites in the zoned Rattlesnake Tuff and are consistent with an origin of the least evolved high-silica rhyolites by partial melting of a mafic crust. While the most evolved rhyolites are compositionally virtually indistinguishable from those of calcalkaline suites, the parental rhyolites from bimodal suites are more Fe-rich than their calcalkaline counterparts. Oxygen isotope thermometry yields pre-eruptive temperatures of 860 degrees C, in keeping with 800-880 degrees C zircon saturation temperatures. High magmatic temperatures are common among rhyolites of bimodal suites, distinguishing them from cooler rhyolites of calcalkaline suites. Extraction of interstitial melt from a granodioritic mush cannot produce compositions of the Rattlesnake Tuff on the basis of major and trace element arguments (especially Fe, Ba, Sr, and Eu) and on the basis of temperature considerations. Chemically viable parental crystal mushes are syenite and alkali (A-type) granites for the production of all more evolved Rattlesnake Tuff rhyolites; ferro-dacitic mush is required for production of the least-evolved, parental Rattlesnake Tuff rhyolite. Paucity of such ferro-dacitic compositions in tholeiitic bimodal suites, especially compared to the abundance of dacitic (granodioritic) compositions in calcalkaline suites, argues against the mush extraction model for the parental rhyolite. Furthermore, rhyolites of bimodal suites lack associated voluminous eruptions of crystal-rich ignimbrite that might represent a parental mush, as exemplified by the "monotonous intermediate" Fish Canyon Tuff in calcalkaline suites. We conclude that extensive fractionation is common among rhyolites and may obscure their ancestry. Fe-rich parental rhyolites common in bimodal tholeiitic suites, as represented by Rattlesnake Tuff, may often be the result of partial melting of mafic to intermediate crust, in contrast to calcalkaline high-silica rhyolites that are related to voluminous suites of intermediate intrusive rocks where the pre-plutonic mush-extraction model works better.},

abstract = {Systematic regional sampling along the contact zone of the 1.85 Ga age Sudbury Igneous Complex with the Archean Levack Gneiss footwall in the North Range of the Sudbury structure revealed textural, mineralogical, and fluid inclusion systematics of post-Sudbury Igneous Complex hydrothermal processes that affected the various lithologies. At late stages of emplacement of the Sudbury Igneous Complex and formation of magmatic Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide deposits a partial melt from the Levack Gneiss invaded the contact zone. This partial melt is revealed by small microdikes and irregular bodies of granophyric quartz-plagioclase with megacrysts of hornblende, clinopyroxene, and titanite. Plagioclase-hornblende equilibrium was established at 750° to 800°C and 1.10 to 1.55 kbars pressure, corresponding to about a 4- to 6-km depth under lithostatic conditions. F/Cl wt percent ratios around 15 for accessory apatite and hornblende indicate that a Cl-rich fluid phase separated during the crystallization of the footwall granophyre: this is expressed as miarolites. The Cl-rich fluid (50 wt {\%} NaCl equiv salinity) was trapped as primary fluid inclusions in quartz at around 480°C minimum temperature and around 1.1 kbars minimum pressure during supercooling. These inclusions are rich in Ca, Fe, Mn, and K, as well as Na chloride. This fluid may have interacted with earlier primary magmatic sulfide, causing remobilization and reprecipitation of Cu-Ni-platinum-group elements (PGE) in veins and disseminations in the footwall. These veins are parallel to the Sudbury Igneous Complex-footwall contact and are characterized by chalcopyrite, pentlandite, millerite, magnetite, stilpnomelane, ferropyrosmalite, epidote, and chlorite. Michenerite, moncheite, merenskyite, froodite, insizwaite, sobolevskite, gold, and Bi-Ni sulfides are associated with sulfides. Epidote, quartz, actinolite, and chlorite are common in the alteration selvages of the veins. Compositions and assemblages of platinum-group minerals (PGM) indicate their precipitation below 575° to 485°C. Primary, highly saline fluid inclusions (about 40 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) in quartz indicate crystallization at 400° to 480°C and around 1.6 kbars minimum T and P, respectively. Late carbonate-epidote-actinolite-chlorite veins and alteration overprinted the earlier assemblages at about 300° to 400°C, with some bornite, millerite, native silver, and other Bi sulfides.$\backslash$nThe second stage of hydrothermal activity is characterized by regional carbonic-aqueous (NaCl-CO2-CH4-H2O-type) immiscible fluids that were trapped as secondary inclusions in quartz from various lithologies. No mineralization is related to this stage along the North Range. Boiling of these fluids took place during a pressure drop from lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions during uplift from about a 5- to 6- to a 3- to 4-km depth at 300° to 350°C. High- (20–26 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) and low-salinity (6–12 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) fluids coexisted with different carbonic species contents. The predominant north-south and northwest-southeast orientations of fluid inclusion planes reveal that mobilization of carbonic-aqueous solutions may be related to the northwesterly oriented thrusting in the Sudbury structure during the late stages (1.8–1.7 Ga) of the Penokean orogeny and to predominantly north-south faulting in the North Range.$\backslash$nThe third stage of fluid mobilization also took place mostly along northerly and northwesterly oriented fractures. Aqueous fluids were Ca-rich brines (20–40 wt {\%} salinity) with temperatures between 150° and 250°C. Some of these fluids also circulated in fractures parallel to the Sudbury Igneous Complex-footwall contact (NE-SW); thus, they locally may have interacted with the earlier sulfide assemblages and are also responsible for formation of late veinlets with chalcopyrite-epidote-quartz-chlorite assemblages. Mobilization of these fluids took place under litho- and hydrostatic conditions at about a 4- to 6-km depth. This hydrothermal activity is related to a regional tectonothermal event during emplacement of northwesterly oriented Sudbury dikes (1.24 Ga).$\backslash$nRegional-scale fluid inclusion studies along the North Range highlight the role of multiple hydrothermal processes in the metallogenic evolution of the Sudbury Igneous Complex and especially in the distribution of copper and precious metals in the footwall units.},

abstract = {Overview Magma chambers are continuous bodies of magma in the crust where magma accumulates and differentiates. Both geophysical and geochemical techniques have illuminated many aspects of magma chambers since they were first proposed. In this chapter, we review these observations in the context of heat and mass transfer theory. This chapter reviews heat transfer calculations from magma chamber to the surrounding crust, and also considers the coupled stress fields that are generated and modified by the presence of magmatic systems. The fluid dynamics of magma chambers has received considerable attention over the last several decades and here we review the ramifications of convection in magma chambers. Multiphase flow (melt + crystals + bubbles) plays a particularly important role in the evolution of magma chambers. The large density differences between melt and discrete phases such as bubbles and crystals, and the resulting flow fields generated by buoyancy are shown to be an efficient mechanism to generate mixing in chamber systems. Finally we discuss integrative approaches between geophysics and geochemistry and future directions of research. Introduction The compositional diversity of melts that reach the surface of the Earth, and diversity in eruptive style, are largely determined through processing of these melts as they ascend and sometimes stall in the crust. Most eruptive products and intrusive suites have been modified substantially from their progenitor mantle magmas, either through preferential removal of crystal phases during fractionation, assimilation of crustal melts, or a combination of these processes (Daly, 1914; Anderson, 1976; Wyllie, 1977; Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988; DePaolo et al., 1992; Feeley et al., 2002). Much of the evolution of these magmas likely occurs where they spend the most time: where magma has either permanently or temporarily stalled in magma chambers. This accumulation is fundamental to the genesis of large eruptions, as the background flux from the mantle cannot explain the voluminous outbursts of magma at the surface of the Earth. Magma chamber dynamics largely control the compositional evolution of these magmas, and ultimately a better understanding of magma chambers may provide clues to the triggering of eruptions.},

abstract = {Geochemical and isotope results are presented from a new study of the most southern basalts in the Deccan Trap, India. Three chemical formations are recognised, two of which can be correlated with the established stratigraphy in Mahabaleshwar and imply a regional southerly dip of 0.06° over a distance of 250 km. In detail Sr-isotope variations within the Ambenali and Mahabaleshwar Formations can be shown to reflect three distinct end-members which provide new constraints for petrogenetic models. Pb-isotope data for selected basalts exhibit a wide range with206Pb/204Pb= 16.87–22.45, and a linear correlation on a Pb—Pb diagram. The least contaminated Ambenali basalts plot within the Pb-array, and interaction with mantle lithosphere involves a shift to less radiogenic Pb whereas contamination with crust is characterised by more radiogenic Pb. Unlike the Karoo and Parana continental flood basalt provinces only four flow units within the southern Deccan appear to contain a significant contribution from mantle lithosphere. The Mahabaleshwar and Ambenali Formation basalts exhibit a striking negative Pb—Sr isotope trend which is presently regarded as one of the features of interaction with shallow level lithospheric mantle. It further suggests that basalts from the Walvis Ridge, Kerguelen and Ninetyeast ridge all remobilised such shallow level material, and that the Deccan basalts which were not affected by crustal contamination reflect interaction between asthenospheric material similar to T-type MORB, but related to the Reunion hotspot, and continental mantle lithosphere of the Indian plate.},

abstract = {Zoned crystals of carbocernaite occur in hydrothermally reworked burbankite-fluorapatite-bearing calcite carbonatite at Bear Lodge, Wyoming. The mineral is paragenetically associated with pyrite, strontianite, barite, ancylite-(Ce), and late-stage calcite, and is interpreted to have precipitated from sulfate-bearing fluids derived from an external source and enriched in Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, and rare-earth elements (REE) through dissolution of the primary calcite and burbankite. The crystals of carbocer- naite show a complex juxtaposition of core-rim, sectoral, and oscillatory zoning patterns arising from significant variations in the content of all major cations, which can be expressed by the empirical formula (Ca0.43–0.91 Sr0.40–0.69 REE0.18–0.59 Na0.18–0.53 Ba0–0.08 )$\Sigma$1.96–2.00 (CO3 )2 . Interelement correlations indicate that the examined crystals can be viewed as a solid solution between two hypothetical end-members, CaSr(CO3 )2 and NaREE(CO3 )2 , with the most Na-REE-rich areas in pyramidal (morphologically speaking) growth sectors representing a probable new mineral species. Although the Bear Lodge car- bocernaite is consistently enriched in light REE relative to heavy REE and Y (chondrite-normalized La/Er = 500–4200), the pyramidal sectors exhibit a greater degree of fractionation between these two groups of elements relative to their associated prismatic sectors. A sample approaching the solid-solution midline [(Ca0.57 Na0.42 )$\Sigma$0.99 (Sr0.50 REE0.47 Ba0.01 )$\Sigma$0.98 (CO3 )2 ] was studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and shown to have a monoclinic symmetry [space group P11m, a = 6.434(4), b = 7.266(5), c = 5.220(3) {\AA}, $\gamma$ = 89.979(17)°, Z = 2] as opposed to the orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pb21 m) proposed in earlier studies. The symmetry reduction is due to partial cation order in sevenfold-coordinated sites occupied predominantly by Ca and Na, and in tenfold-coordinated sites hosting Sr, REE, and Ba. The ordering also causes splitting of carbonate vibrational modes at 690–740 and 1080–1100 cm–1 in Raman spectra. Using Raman micro-spectroscopy, carbocernaite can be readily distinguished from burbankite- and ancylite-group carbonates characterized by similar energy-dispersive spectra.},

abstract = {High-resolution X-ray computed tomography has been carried out on a suite of komatiite samples representing a range of volcanic facies, chromite contents and degrees of alteration and metamorphism, to reveal the wide range of sizes, shapes and degrees of clustering that chromite grains display as a function of cooling history. Dendrites are spectacularly skeletal chromite grains formed during very rapid crystallization of supercooled melt in spinifex zones close to flow tops. At slower cooling rates in the interiors of thick flows, chromite forms predominantly euhedral grains. Large clusters (up to a dozen of grains) are characteristic of liquidus chromite, whereas fine dustings of mostly individual {\~{}}20-$\mu$m grains form by in situ crystallization from trapped intercumulus liquid. Chromite in coarse-grained olivine cumulates from komatiitic dunite bodies occurs in two forms: as clusters or chains of euhedral crystals, developing into “chicken-wire” texture where chromite is present in supra-cotectic proportions; and as strongly dendritic, semi-poikilitic grains. These dendritic grains are likely to have formed by rapid crescumulate growth from magma that was close to its liquidus temperature but supersaturated with chromite. In some cases, this process seems to have been favoured by nucleation of chromite on the margins of sulphide liquid blebs. This texture is a good evidence for the predominantly cumulus origin of oikocrysts and in situ origin of heteradcumulate textures. Our 3D textural analysis confirms that the morphology of chromite crystals is a distinctive indicator of crystallization environment even in highly altered rocks.},

abstract = {The carbonatites of Brava Island, Cape Verde hot spot, allow to investigate whether they represent small mantle melt fractions or form through extreme fractionation and/or liquid immiscibility from CO2-bearing silicate magmas. The intrusive carbonatites on Brava Island are part of a strongly silica-undersaturated pyroxenite, ijolite, nephelinite, nepheline syenite, combeite–foiditite, carbonatite series. The major and trace element composition of this suite is reproduced by a model fractionating olivine, clinopyroxene, perovskite, biotite, apatite, titanite, sodalite and FeTi oxides, all present as phenocrysts in the rocks corresponding to their fractionation interval. Fractionation of {\~{}}90 wt{\%} crystals reproduces the observed geochemical trend from the least evolved ultramafic dikes (bulk X Mg = 0.64) to syenitic compositions. The modelled fractional crystallization leads to alkali enrichment, driving the melt into the carbonatite–silicate miscibility gap. An initial CO2 content of 4000 ppm is sufficient to saturate in CO2 at the point where the rock record suggests continuing unmixing carbonatites from nephelinites to nepheline syenites after 61 wt{\%} fractionation. Such immiscibility is also manifested in carbonatite and silicate domains on a hand-specimen scale. Furthermore, almost identical primary clinopyroxene, biotite and carbonate compositions from carbonatites and nephelinites to nepheline syenites substantiate their conjugate character and our unmixing model. The modelled carbonatite compositions correspond to the natural ones except for their much higher alkali contents. The alkali-poor character of the carbonatites on Brava and elsewhere is likely a consequence of the release of alkali-rich CO2 + H2O fluids during final crystallization, which cause fenitization in adjacent rocks. We propose a general model for carbonatite generation during alkaline magmatism, where the fractionation of heavily Si-undersaturated, alkaline parent melts results in alkali and CO2 enrichment in the evolving melt, ultimately leading to immiscibility between carbonatites and evolved Si-undersaturated alkaline melts. Early saturation in feldspathoids or feldspars would limit alkali enrichment preventing the formation of carbonatites. The complete and continuous fractionation line from almost primitive melts to syenitic compositions on Brava underlines the possibly important role of intrusives for hot spot volcanism.},

abstract = {The intraplate volcanic suite of the Cha{\^{i}}ne des Puys (French Massif Central) shows a complete petrologic range, from alkali basalts to trachytes. The significant variations of trace elements and radiogenic isotopes along the series strongly support the occurrence of crustal assimilation associated with fractional crystallization (AFC). The least contaminated basalts are clearly related to a HIMU-type reservoir (206Pb/204Pb {\textgreater} 19.6; 87Sr/86Sr {\textless} 0.7037; $\epsilon$Nd {\textgreater} + 4). The behavior of radiogenic isotopes suggests that the most likely crustal contaminants are meta-sediments located in the lower crust. The Li isotopic compositions of the lavas range from high $\delta$7Li ({\textgreater} + 7‰) in basalts to lighter values in more evolved lavas (down to $\delta$7Li ≈ 0‰). The mantle component, expressed in the least evolved lavas, has a heavy Li isotopic signature, in good agreement with previous $\delta$7Li measurements of OIB lavas with HIMU affinities. The evolution of Li isotopic compositions throughout the volcanic series is in agreement with the AFC model suggested by the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic systems. Although the behavior of Li isotopes during assimilation processes is currently poorly constrained, our calculations suggest that at least a portion of the lower crust beneath the Cha{\^{i}}ne des Puys is characterized by a light Li isotopic composition ($\delta$7Li {\textless} - 5‰). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Oceanic island basalts sample mantle reservoirs that are isotopically and compositionally heterogeneous. The Hawaiian–Emperor chain represents ∼85 Myr of volcanism supplied by a deep mantle plume. Two geographically and geochemically delineated trends, Kea and Loa, are well documented within the Hawaiian Islands. Enriched Loa compositions originate from subduction recycled or primordial material stored in deep mantle reservoirs such as the large low shear velocity province (LLSVP) below Hawai‘i. Loa compositions have not been observed along the Emperor Seamounts ({\textgreater}50 Ma), whereas lavas on the Hawaiian Islands ({\textless}6.5 Ma) sample both Kea and Loa sources. Lead isotopes in shield lavas along the Northwest Hawaiian Ridge (NWHR) spanning ∼42 Myr between the bend in the chain and the Hawaiian Islands record the geochemical evolution of the Hawaiian mantle plume over a time period when many geophysical parameters (volcanic propagation rate, magmatic flux, mantle potential temperature) increased significantly. Along the NWHR, the Loa geochemical component appears ephemerally, which we link to the sampling of different lower mantle compositional domains by the Hawaiian mantle plume. The plume initially sampled only the deep Pacific mantle (Kea component) from outside the LLSVP during the formation of the Emperor Seamounts. Southward migration and anchoring of the plume on the LLSVP led to entrainment of increasing amounts of LLSVP material (Loa component) along the NWHR as documented by an increase in208Pb*/206Pb* with decreasing age. The correlation between208Pb*/206Pb* and magmatic flux suggests source composition affects the magmatic flux, and explains why the Hawaiian mantle plume has dramatically strengthened through time.},

abstract = {The combined use of field geology, radioisotopic dating and magnetic stratigraphy applied to the old shield volcanoes of Tenerife provides a reliable time framework for the early, shield-stage evolution of the island. The greater part of this new set of ages, obtained from sequences of lava flows is in agreement with the astronomical polarity time scale. This approach illustrates that previous K–Ar data collected without a comprehensive stratigraphy should be viewed with caution, and in some cases discarded altogether. The shield volcanoes of Tenerife encompass a relatively small number of magnetozones, an observation consistent with the relatively short periods of growth shown by the new ages (1–2 my). The island was constructed by the aggregation of three successive shields: the Roque del Conde (Central shield), between about 11.9 and 8.9 Ma, and the Teno (6.2–5.6 Ma) and Anaga (4.9–3.9 Ma) volcanoes. This new oldest subaerial age of Tenerife fits with the others obtained in the Canaries in a clear west to east monotonous age progression, one of the main restrictions for hotspot-related island chains.},

abstract = {The Granadilla Member is one of the most widely dispersed and largest volume pyroclastic units at Tenerife (Canary Islands) and represents the culminating eruption to a second cycle of explosive volcanism of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice. The member, dated at 0.57 Ma, comprises a plinian fall deposit, the Granadilla pumice, which is overlain by ignimbrite up to 30 m thick. The Granadilla pumice is up to 9 m thick approximately 10 km from source (Pyle bt value is 5.35 km), and is subdivided into four fall units. Unit 1 is up to 1.2 m thick and is further divisible into another four pumice fall subunits, based on bedding and grainsize differences. Unit 2 is a thin but distinctive ash layer (∼2 cm thick), and its wide dispersal ({\textgreater}550 km2), constant thickness, planar laminations and ash aggregate textures collectively indicate a phreatoplinian fall origin. The lithic-rich nature and abundance of unaltered lithic fragments reflect magma interaction with aquifer-derived water at depth. Unit 3 (≤1.8 m thick), records a reversal to dry plinian eruptive activity. Unit 4, the thickest of the fall units (up to 6.3 m thick), records the maximum dispersal and intensity of the eruption (Pyle bt and bc values are 5.7 and 6.3 km, respectively), best illustrated by the presence of large pumice bombs up to 30 cm diameter (at distances up to 20 km from vent), and reverse grading of lithic and pumice clasts. The widespread ({\textgreater}500 km2), nonwelded and pumice-rich Granadilla ignimbrite (unit 5) records the collapse of the plinian eruption column. The ignimbrite has a simple sheet-like geometry, but exhibits a complex internal stratigraphy. The base of the ignimbrite locally cuts down through the underlying Granadilla pumice removing it entirely, indicating up to 9 m of erosion by the pyroclastic flows. A coarse, vent-derived lithic breccia horizon towards the top of the ignimbrite is interpreted to record the onset of caldera collapse late in the eruption.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMinimum volume estimates for the Granadilla pumice and ignimbrite are 5.2 and 5 km3, respectively. The dispersal area, deposit characteristics, and exponential thickness and clast size decay relationships with (isopach area)1/2 are consistent with dispersal and fallout from the umbrella region of a moderately high (∼17 to ≥25 km) plinian column. We propose that the eruption involved two vents, probably aligned along a NE–SW fissure within the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas caldera.},

abstract = {Evidence for early differentiation events in the Earth's mantle similar to those that demonstrably affected the Moon and Mars seems to be embedded in the existence of largely super-chondritic 143Nd/144Nd ratios in the Early Archean terrestrial mantle. Samples from the ca. 3.8 Ga old rocks from the Isua supracrustal belt, Greenland, and from the ca. 2.1 Ga old juvenile segment of Birimian crust, West Africa, were measured for Nd and Hf isotopic compositions in order to evaluate whether Hf systematics may help enlighten this debate. The determination of Nd and Hf initial isotopic compositions of these terranes is entangled with the uncertainty of which geological events isochron ages and ion probe zircon U-Pb ages actually record, and by metasomatic fractionation of parent/daughter element ratios. It is shown that Nd and Hf mobility has affected the samples for which the Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios depart from the range of modern volcanic rocks. The most conspicuous effect is a preferential leaching of Hf—presumably accompanied by Zr—from mafic metavolcanic rocks. Precipitation of Zr from metasomatic fluids may explain the significantly younger overgrowth zones on zircons from the felsic rocks. For Isua, the pooled whole-rock isochron ages are 3.712 ± 26 Ga (Nd) and 3.593 ± 15 Ga (Hf), while for the Birimian the respective ages are 2.135 ± 29 Ga (Nd) and 2.093 ± 16 Ga (Hf). Elemental mobility and the unsupported assumption of minimum variance underlying the isochron model, however, render the significance of these ages questionable. In an attempt to restore possible ancient mantle-crust arrays, the trajectory of each sample in the ($\epsilon$Nd[T], $\epsilon$Hf[T]) space for variable values of the age T are reconstructed. Our best estimate for the isotopic properties of the mantle protolith is $\epsilon$Nd[3.85] ≈ +2 ± 2 and $\epsilon$Hf[3.85] ≈ +4 ± 2 for Isua and $\epsilon$Nd[2.15] ≈ +3 ± 1 and $\epsilon$Hf[2.15] ≈ +6 ± 2 for the Birimian. We therefore agree with the earlier suggestion that some samples from the Isua supracrustal belt were extracted from a mantle that went through strong parent/daughter fractionation very early in the Earth's history. This event may be the original differentiation of a largely molten mantle in the presence of majorite garnet. In addition, the contrast between the isotopically inferred long-term Lu/Hf fractionation and the actual Lu/Hf ratio of the rocks requires that garnet was present as a residual mineral (the ‘Hf paradox'). It indicates that melting must have started in the Archean in plumes at a very deep level, thereby providing a mechanism to create thick buoyant oceanic plateaux that would act as nuclei for proto-continents.},

abstract = {In the study of geochemical mass balances at subduction zones, the composition of the mantle wedge prior to additions from the slab is a critically important yet poorly constrained parameter. Deconvolving the influence of ancient versus modern enrichments is particularly difficult, especially when considering elements that are highly mobile. Here we provide an alternative approach, using less mobile elements, and a filter to remove the effects of recent slab additions. We provide new Hf isotope data for 30 Mariana Trough (MT) backarc basin lavas. Once filtered, Hf and Nd isotope ratios are highly correlated, of Indian mid-oceanic ridge basalt character, and display variations similar to ocean ridges of comparable lengths. The isotopic variability observed in this “ambient mantle” provides a new paradigm for the interpretation of the varied volcanic products of the arc. Thus, shoshonites associated with the northern termination of the backarc basin rift axis reflect the interaction of a subducted sediment melt with an isotopically enriched mantle source. In contrast, the large volcanoes of the Central Island province have a consistent offset in Nd isotope compositions from the MT array resulting from fluid addition. Existing data for smaller edifices in the submarine portion of the arc have larger variations resulting from fluid addition on a more local scale. We suggest that the similar characterization of ambient mantle elsewhere may help to resolve many conflicting geochemical observations in arc lavas worldwide.},

The experiments were conducted at pressures of 1.0 GPa and temperatures of 1250 ??C. The rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, and Lu), Y, and Sr are compatible in apatite, whereas the larger lithophile elements (Cs, Rb, and Ba) are strongly incompatible. Other trace elements such as U, Th, and Pb have partition coefficients close to unity. In all experiments we found DHf {\textgreater} DZr, DTa ??? DNb, and DBa {\textgreater} DRb {\textgreater} DCs. The experiments reveal a strong influence of melt composition on REE partition coefficients. With increasing polymerisation of the melt, apatite/melt partition coefficients for the rare earth elements increase for about an order of magnitude. We also present some results in fluorine-rich and water-rich systems, respectively, but no significant influence of either H2O or F on the partitioning was found. Furthermore, we also present experimentally determined partition coefficients in close-to natural compositions which should be directly applicable to magmatic processes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We compare the petrogenetic and chemical signatures of two alkali silicate suites from the Cretaceous Damaraland igneous province (Namibia), one with and one without associated carbonatite, in order to explore their differences in terms of magma source and evolution. The Etaneno complex occurs in close spatial proximity to the Kalkfeld bimodal carbonatite-alkali silicate complex, and is dominated by nepheline (ne)-monzosyenites and ne-bearing alkali feldspar syenites. The Etaneno samples have isotopic compositions of87Sr/86Sr(i) = 0.70462-0.70508 and $\epsilon$Nd = -0.5 to -1.5, with the highest87Sr/86Sr(i) and lowest $\epsilon$Nd values observed in evolved samples. The magma differentiated via olivine, feldspar, clinopyroxene, and nepheline (ne) fractionation in a F-rich system, which fractionated Zr from Hf, and Y from Ho. Partly glassy, recrystallized inclusions in some samples are less evolved than their host rocks and contain a cumulate component (nepheline, plagioclase). The Kalkfeld nefoidites (ijolites) and ne-syenites have87Sr/86Sr(i) = 0.70285-0.70592 and $\epsilon$Nd = 0.5 to 1.1. The isotope ratios show no consistent variation with rock composition, and they are in the same range as the associated carbonatites. The Kalkfeld silicate magma fractionated nepheline and alkali-feldspar in a CO2-dominated, F- and Ca-poor system. As a result, the rocks display some major and trace element trends distinctly different from those of the Etaneno samples. We suggest that the Etaneno and the Kalkfeld magmas represent different melt fractions of a heterogeneous mantle source, resulting in different compositions especially with respect to CO2contents of the primitive, parental magmas. In this scenario, the carbonated alkali silicate Kalkfeld parental melt contained a critical CO2concentration and underwent liquid separation of carbonate and silicate melt fractions at crustal depths. The resulting silicate melt fraction experienced a very different mode of differentiation than the carbonate-poor Etaneno parental magma. Thus, the Kalkfeld rocks are depleted in Ca and other divalent cations, as well as F, rare-earth elements (REE), Ba, and P relative to the Etaneno syenites. We interpret these differences to reflect the partitioning of these elements into the carbonate melt fraction during immiscible separation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Ion microprobe analyses of clinopyroxenes in equilibrium with glasses (SiO2 from 42 to 69 wt{\%}) formed as the result of AFC-type reactions between infiltrating basaltic melt and peridotite wall-rock in the upper mantle under La Palma (Canary Islands) reveal trace element signatures usually ascribed to carbonatite metasomatism (i.e. strong REE-enrichment and Zr,Ti-depletion). Cpx/glass partition coefficients for REE, Y and Sr progressively increase with increasing SiO2 in response to liquid composition/structure effects, approaching unity for La, Ce and Sr, and exceeding unity for the other REE in the most silicic glasses. Partition coefficients for Zr and Ti remain constant or decrease, probably as the combined effect of melt composition/structure and difficulty of charge-balancing 4+ cations in the crystal. Incorporation of the higher-charged HFSE in the cpx lattice requires complex coupled substitutions (e.g. M1Zr+1TAl+2M1R2+−1TSi−2 or M2Na+1M1Zr+1TAl+1M2Ca−1M1R2+−1TSi−1). Our results demonstrate that REE-enrichment and REE/HFSE fractionation of clinopyroxene do not necessarily reflect these characteristics in the metasomatic agent and that cpx/basaltD cannot confidently be used to infer the geochemical nature of equilibrium melts under upper mantle conditions. Moreover, we provide evidence that the strong REE-enrichment and Zr,Ti-depletion of some clinopyroxene from La Palma xenoliths is a feature commonly observed in clinopyroxenes from various mantle occurrences often interpreted as reflecting chemical interaction with metasomatic fluids and melts of different composition (either alkaline or carbonatitic) and provenance (from either the enriched asthenospheric mantle or the subducted slab). Therefore, claims of carbonatite metasomatism as opposed to silicate melt infiltration based on trace element signatures of investigated clinopyroxene should be regarded with caution unless the role of liquid composition/structure and of crystal chemical control is investigated.},

abstract = {1 Since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, volcanologists have made considerable progress toward predicting eruptions on the basis of precursors that typically start a few days to several months in advance. Although accurate eruption prediction is by no means routine, it may now be possible in some cases to extend the effective warning period by anticipating the onset of short-term precursors. Three promising indicators of deep magmatic processes are (1) deep, long-period earthquakes and tremor that indicate the ascent of magma through the crust, (2) magmatic CO2 emission rate as a proxy for magma supply rate, and (3) relatively broad, generally aseismic surface uplift caused by magmatic intrusions. In the latter case it is essential to sample the deformation field thoroughly in both time and space to adequately constrain source models. Until recently, this has been nearly impossible because high-precision sensors could not be deployed in sufficient numbers, nor could extensive geodetic surveys be conducted often enough. Advances in instrumentation, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and telecommunications are helping to overcome these limitations. As a result, comprehensive geodetic monitoring of selected volcanoes is now feasible. A combination of InSAR, large-aperture GPS surveys, microgravity surveys, and dense arrays of continuous GPS stations, strain meters, and tiltmeters can reveal both spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation throughout the eruption cycle. Improved geodetic monitoring of many of the world's volcanoes would be a major stride toward better understanding of magmatic processes and longer-term eruption forecasts.},

abstract = {The 1.5-Ma Adeje Formation in SW Tenerife contains an ignimbrite sheet with remarkable textural and chemical complexity. A basal Plinian pumice-fall layer is overlain by a partly welded compound ignimbrite in which phonolitic pumice lapilli and dense obsidian spatter rags with irregular, fluidal-shaped margins are supported in a poorly sorted tuff matrix. The lower ignimbrite flow-unit contains accretionary lapilli in its upper part, overlain by an ash-pellet-bearing fallout layer from a co-ignimbrite plume. The upper ignimbrite flow-unit comprises a locally welded massive lapilli-tuff that grades up into lithic breccia containing juvenile obsidian blocks and both cognate and vent-derived lithic blocks. Geochemically, the Adeje Formation shows two distinct juvenile populations that relate to crystal-poor and crystal-rich magma types. Crystal-rich juvenile clasts contain multiple compositions of ilmenite and magnetite, and crystal aggregates of bytownite (An79–86). The varied assemblage of juvenile clasts reflects an eruptive style that may have involved rapid changes in magma chamber pressure associated with caldera collapse, and possibly the disruption of a lava lake. The Adeje eruption started with a Plinian explosive phase that rained ash and pumice lapilli across SW Tenerife; followed by pyroclastic fountaining feeding density currents with explosive ejecta of juvenile glassy material producing the coarse, spatter-bearing ignimbrite facies. A short pause between pyroclastic density currents is recorded by the co-ignimbrite ash and pellet-fall bed. The climactic phase of the eruption probably involved caldera subsidence as recorded by a widespread massive heterolithic breccia.},

abstract = {The origin of the large range of compositional diversity encompassed by primitive arc magmas and the respective roles of mantle heterogeneity versus slab-derived contributions are the center of ongoing debate. The Cascade Arc of western North America is a global endmember hot subduction zone and an ideal setting in which to examine fundamental questions about the origin of arc magmas. Cascade Arc primitive magmas define several distinct compositional endmembers, the most widespread of which are high alumina olivine tholeiite (HAOT), calc-alkaline basalt (CAB), and intraplate-type basalt (IPB). New high precision Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic and trace element data for 49 of the most primitive magmas from seven major High Cascades volcanic centers are used to assess whether the basalt groups are derived from geochemically distinct mantle sources. Along with recently published data for the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB), the northern and other major segment of the Cascade Arc, and Mt. Rainier, the new data expand the high-precision isotopic coverage to seventeen volcanic centers spanning the {\~{}} 1300 km length of the arc. In all investigated isotopic systems, the new High Cascades data allow for finer resolution with much less scatter than previous data. HAOT mantle sources are systematically more depleted in incompatible elements than CAB sources, yet High Cascades CABs and HAOTs are isotopically indistinguishable, defining a remarkable linear Pb isotopic array consistent with a single mantle endmember that is similar to the source of Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge basalts. This mantle has been variably modified by contributions from a single subducting sediment endmember that is a close isotopic match to average Northern Cascadia basin sediment. Although Astoria Fan sediment was previously used as a proxy for the subducting sediment composition in the Cascadia subduction zone, the isotope ratios of Cascades basalts record no input from Astoria Fan sediment. High Cascades CABs and HAOTs both contain subducting sediment input in the form of a melt, but CABs also contain melts of subducting oceanic crust which is most apparent in the southern Cascades high-Sr/P suite and in the GVB. The least sediment input is recorded by GVB basalts, which also become progressively lower in 208Pb*/206Pb* and Hf isotope ratios to the north, reflecting the influx of an isotopically distinct enriched mantle component that generates IPBs at the northern slab edge. Enriched mantle with a composition trending towards HIMU is also recorded by a distinct isotopic array that is defined by IPBs from the Mt. Adams-Simcoe back arc region. We propose that slab gaps permit the influx of sub-slab asthenospheric mantle in both the northern GVB and Mt. Adams-Simcoe back-arc. Otherwise, western North America is underlain predominantly by isotopically homogeneous, MORB-type depleted mantle from which both the CAB and HAOT basalt groups are derived. Our results from the Cascades imply that most of the compositional heterogeneity encompassed by primitive arc magmas is not related to the presence of multiple mantle components but to variability in the composition and quantity of slab contributions. This study highlights the importance of high precision Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope and trace element data in obtaining new insights on the petrogenesis of arc magmas.},

All experiments produced homogeneous glasses and large euhedral phenocrysts with minimal compositional zonation. The results of the crystal-melt partitioning data are applicable to understanding the geochemical evolution of rhyodacitic melts at fluid-saturated shallow crustal levels, the composition of fluid phases later exsolved due to second boiling, and the effects of halogens on amphibole crystal chemistry.

abstract = {Improvements in experimental, analytical and computational methodologies together with published studies yielding seemingly contradictory results prompted us to return to the determination of zircon stability in the range of felsic to intermediate melts expected in continental environments. We (re-)analyzed both the run products from the zircon crystallization study of Watson and Harrison (1983) and a new style of zircon dissolution experiments (up to 25kbar) using a large radius ion microprobe to constrain a refined zircon solubility model. The new data yield broadly similar patterns as before when arrayed for temperature and confirm that the parameter M [=(Na+K+2Ca)/(Al.Si)] is an appropriate compositional proxy for the chemical interactions through which zircon is dissolved. We used a Bayesian approach to optimize the calculation of the coefficients in the zircon solution model, which is given by:lnDZr=10108??32/TK-1.16??0.15M-1-1.48??0.09where DZr is the distribution coefficient of Zr between zircon and melt and the errors are at one sigma. Sensitivity tests indicate that temperature and composition are the two dominant controls on zircon solubility in crustal melts with no observable effects due to pressure (up to 25kbar) or variable water content. Comparison of the down-temperature extrapolation with natural examples confirms the validity of the model at ca. 700??C. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Collapse calderas are sub-circular volcanic depressions caused by subsidence of the magma reservoir roof during an eruption. Scaled physical models of caldera collapse using flat topography have been instrumental in investigating the spatial and temporal development of calderas, in particular, two distinctive sets of concentric ring faults, one reverse and one normal. More recent analog studies have investigated the effect of non-flat topography which alters the principle stress trajectories and resulting collapse structure. This work provides the basis for investigating how naturally scaled topographic loads may affect caldera collapse in relation to shallow magma reservoirs. The objective of this study is to understand how a near-ridge seamount affects caldera collapse from both a central and offset position as the seamount migrates above the magma reservoir as a result of plate motion. We utilize scaled analog models of caldera collapse in conjunction with three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning and digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to investigate caldera collapse dynamics at near-ridge seamounts. Experiments using a seamount cone positioned centrally above the magma reservoir result in (1) increased subsidence along the interior outward-dipping faults and (2) a preference to more symmetric collapse patterns as indicated by the subsidence profile and structure of the caldera relative to experiments with an offset cone. When the cone is offset, the collapse is asymmetric and trapdoor in nature, with the center of greatest subsidence displaced away from the region of largest topographic load. For these latter experiments, subsidence is focused where the roof is thinnest along an initial reverse fault, followed by a transition to an antithetic graben structure. The asymmetric collapse in the experiments results in a caldera with a tilted profile. Offset calderas at near-ridge seamounts are tilted towards the ridge axis, suggesting that they may have collapsed asymmetrically similar to our experiments. Furthermore, the graben structure observed in asymmetric collapse experiments is consistent with structures observed in some natural trapdoor basaltic volcanoes.},

abstract = {The solubility of gold has been measured in aqueous sulphide solutions from 100 to 500??C at 500 bar in order to determine the stability and stoichiometry of sulphide complexes of gold(I) in hydrothermal solutions. The experiments were carried out in a flow-through system. The solubilities, measured as total dissolved gold, were in the range 3.6 ?? 10-8 to 6.65 ?? 10-4 mol kg-1 (0.007-131 mg kg-1), in solutions of total reduced sulphur between 0.0164 and 0.133 mol kg-1, total chloride between 0.000 and 0.240 mol kg-1, total sodium between 0.000 and 0.200 mol kg-1, total dissolved hydrogen between 1.63 ?? 10-5 and 5.43 ?? 10-4 mol kg-1 and a corresponding pHT,p of 1.5 to 9.8. A non-linear least squares treatment of the data demonstrates that the solubility of gold in aqueous sulphide solutions is accurately described by the reactions Au(s) + H2S(aq) = AuHS(aq) + 05H2(g Ks,100 Au(s) + H2S(aq) + HS- = Au(HS)2- + 0.5H22(g) Ks,110 where AuHS(aq) is the dominant species in acidic solutions and Au(HS)2- under neutral pH conditions. With increasing temperature, the stability field of Au(HS)2- shifts to more alkaline pH in accordance with the shift of the first ionisation constant of H2S(aq). In addition, AuOH(aq) was found to be an important species in acidic solutions at t {\textgreater} 400??C. The equilibrium solubility constant to form AuHS(aq) was found to increase from log K s,100 = -6.20 ?? 0.11 at 200??C to maximum of -5.63 ?? 0.07 to 0.11 at 350??C and then decrease to -6.25 ?? 0.19 at 500??C. The solubility constant to form Au(HS)2- increases with increasing temperature from log Ks,110 = -2.33 ?? 0.14 at 100??C to - 1.27 ?? 0.07 at 250??C and then decrease to - 1.73 ?? 0.25 at 500??C. From these measurements, the equilibrium stepwise and cumulative formation constants were calculated. The complex formation at 25??C is characterised by an exothermic enthalpy and small positive entropy, both of which are consistent with the predominantly covalent interaction between Au+ and HS-. With increasing temperature, the cumulative formation reactions become endothermic and are accompanied with large positive entropy of reaction, indicating greater electrostatic interaction. The aqueous speciation of gold(I) is very sensitive to fluid composition and temperature. In low-temperature geothermal fluids, gold(I) sulphide complexes predominate whereas at higher temperatures, gold(I) hydroxide and chloride complexes may also play a role in hydrothermal gold transport in the Earth's crust.

abstract = {The Middle Miocene Afyon alkaline volcanic complex (western Anatolia) erupted lavas of highly variable geochemistry, ranging from silica-undersaturated to silica-oversaturated and from ultrapotassic to Na-alkaline compositions. There are two major volcanic groups showing substantial differences in K-enrichment and different Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions: plagioclase–amphibole-bearing lavas and sanidine- and/or leucite-bearing lavas. The most remarkable feature of Afyon volcanism is the close relationship in time and space of these two lava types. There is clear stratigraphic evidence for a switch from early Si-oversaturated sanidine- and/or leucite-bearing lavas, towards Si-undersaturated sanidine- and/or leucite-bearing lavas, which eventually change to slightly Si-undersaturated to -saturated plagioclase–amphibole-bearing lavas that make up the youngest formations. This change in composition is coupled with a decrease in 87Sr/86Sr (whole-rock and in situ apatite, perovskite, melilite and clinopyroxene), 207Pb/204Pb, Zr/Nb and Th/Nb, and an increase in 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb and Ce/Pb, thus delineating a systematic change from orogenic (crust-like) to anorogenic (within-plate) signatures. Magma genesis in the Afyon volcanic complex has been controlled by roll-back of a subducted lithospheric slab since the Early Tertiary and post-collisional extensional events in Miocene times. It is associated with the upwelling of asthenospheric mantle through a gap in the subducted slab under western Anatolia. Magmatism is concurrent with the collapse of the orogenic belt and the development of extension-related horst and graben structures. We interpret the geochemical transition from orogenic to anorogenic affinity as being due to the increasing role of lithosphere–asthenosphere interaction that is most strongly reflected in the geochemistry of the Afyon lavas. Melting of peridotite in the convecting mantle (asthenosphere) may be a viable model for the origin of the plagioclase–amphibole-bearing lavas. Their ubiquitous high K2O contents, orogenic trace element signatures and isotopic compositions imply that the asthenosphere-derived primary melts were contaminated by melts derived from lithospheric mantle containing an orogenic chemical signature. Conversely, the ultrapotassic sanidine- and/or leucite-bearing lavas are derived from at least two types of metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The dominant source is a phlogopite–pyroxene-rich metasome, which was generated by recycling of continental sediments during previous subduction episodes. This is responsible for the orogenic geochemical signature dominantly seen in lamproites and shoshonites. On the other hand, melting of recently generated phlogopite-wehrlite metasomes resulted in the parental melts of melilite-leucitites, which should be of proto-kamafugitic composition. The wehrlitic metasomes were generated when convecting mantle-derived precursor melts reacted with lithospheric mantle peridotite along the solidus ledge in the system lherzolite + CO2 ({\textless}22 kbar).},

abstract = {Knowledge of temperature and pressure, however qualitative, has been central to our views of geology since at least the early 19th century. In 1822, for example, Charles Daubeny presented what may be the very first “Geological Thermometer,” comparing temperatures of various geologic processes (Torrens 2006). Daubeny (1835) may even have been the first to measure the temperature of a lava flow, by laying a thermometer on the top of a flow at Vesuvius—albeit several months following the eruption, after intervening rain (his estimate was 390 °F). In any case, pressure (P) and temperature (T) estimation lie at the heart of fundamental questions: How hot is Earth, and at what rate has the planet cooled. Are volcanoes the products of thermally driven mantle plumes? Where are magmas stored, and how are they transported to the surface— and how do storage and transport relate to plate tectonics? Well-calibrated thermometers and barometers are essential tools if we are to fully appreciate the driving forces and inner workings of volcanic systems.},

In most occurrences, these systems will contain other components, the so-called noncondensible gases, such as CO2, CO, SO2, CH4, and N2. The presence of the noncondensible components can greatly alter the thermodynamic properties of the phases and their flow properties as they move in and on the planets. We review various forms of phase diagrams that give information about pressure-temperature-volume-entropy-enthalpy-composition conditions in these complex systems. Fluid dynamic models must be coupled to the thermodynamics to accurately describe flow in gas-driven liquid and solid systems. The concepts are illustrated in detail by considering flow and flow instabilities such as geysering in modern geothermal systems on Earth, paleofluid systems on Mars, and cryogenic ice-gas systems on Mars and Enceladus. We emphasize that consideration of single-component end-member systems often leads to conclusions that exclude many qualitatively and quantitatively important phenomena.},

abstract = {The Sudbury breccia is an impact-generated pseudotachylitic breccia formed in the footwall of the 1.85 Ga Sudbury Igneous Complex in Ontario, Canada. The breccia is commonly developed in areas of contrasting country-rock types, and it represents a common host to footwall-style Cu-Ni-platinum group element sulfide mineralization, developed in the immediate footwall of large, contact-type, Ni-Cu–rich ore deposits at the base of the Sudbury Igneous Complex. Three models have been proposed for the genesis of the Sudbury breccia: (1) in situ frictional or shock melting of target rocks, (2) cataclasis of the target rocks, and/or (3) injection of allochthonous impact melt from the Sudbury Igneous Complex into the brecciated crater floor. This study reports new mineralogical and geochemical data for samples of Sudbury breccia and associated host rocks, both proximal and distal to mineralization, from six different locations around the Sudbury structure. A mixing model was used to construct the composition of the Sudbury breccia matrix, using a combination of country rock and quartz diorite from the offset dikes, which are believed to provide an estimate of the composition of the early melt sheet. We demonstrate that the breccia matrix can be successfully modeled from footwall lithologies with no requirement for a contribution from the impact melt sheet. Instead, we propose a dynamic, parautochthonous in situ melt model, where the matrix of the breccia was derived in part by high-temperature melting of footwall lithologies. These inclusion and crystal-laden melts were mixed and transported into tensile fracture zones that developed adjacent to weaknesses in the country rocks. Principal component analysis of Sudbury breccia indicates that the trace metal content within the breccia that developed distal from mineralization is associated with assimilation of mafic units in the footwall. In contrast, the matrix of Sudbury breccia developed closer to mineral zones has a contribution of metal derived from the fractionated sulfide melt and/or a contribution of hydrothermally remobilized metal. Thus, by comparing the trace metal content in Sudbury breccia with local footwall lithologies, baselines can be established that can help to identify anomalous metal contributions that may be derived from the periphery of a footwall mineral system.},

abstract = {Progressive leaching of plagioclase for Sr isotopes and microdrilling for Sr and Pb isotopes from grains of plagioclase and orthopyroxene from the Critical Zone and the Lower Zone indicates that these minerals are not in isotopic equilibrium. Leaching suggests Critical Zone plagioclase either lost Rb or had a more radiogenic Sri rim relative to the core, whereas plagioclase from an Upper Zone sample is isotopically homogeneous for Sri. Microdrilling analyses of plagioclase from the Lower and Critical Zones consistently have a higher initial 87Sr/86Sr (Sri) and a less radiogenic modeled 238U/204Pb composition ($\mu$2) than coexisting orthopyroxene. The range of calculated Sri for plagioclase and orthopyroxene is 0.70506–0.70662(34) and 0.70290–0.70654(36), respectively. The average difference in Sri between mineral pairs was 0.00095. The range of calculated $\mu$2 for plagioclase and orthopyroxene is 9.42–10.30 (average 9.7) and 9.83–15.75 (average 10.1), respectively. The range of measured 208Pb/206Pb for plagioclase and orthopyroxene is 34.757–36.439(33) and 36.669–41.845(85), respectively. One orthopyroxenite without evidence for more than one population of crystal size distribution, nonetheless had Sri = 0.70654 (36) with calculated $\mu$2 of 10.32 for larger grains as compared with Sri = 0.70290 (32) and calculated $\mu$2 of 9.97 for smaller grain-size fractions. Isotopic results from this study demonstrate that whole-rock isotopic data may not provide the appropriate level of detail necessary to address some processes in the Bushveld Complex. However, systematic changes have the potential to elucidate the timing of contamination with regard to other processes (crystal aging, compaction-driven recrystallization, and mineral exsolution) occurring within a slowly cooled crystal–liquid–vapor mush system.},

abstract = {Germanium (Ge) is a scarce, but not an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust (about 1.6 ppm Ge crustal average). Principal geochemical substitutions and mineral associations of Ge include Si, C, Zn, Cu, Fe, Sn, and Ag. Most Ge is dispersed through silicate minerals due to the substitution of Ge4+ for the geochemically similar Si4+. Ge is unusual in that it exhibits siderophile, lithophile, chalcophile and organophile behaviour in different geologic environments. Only minor variations in Ge concentrations are known from different igneous rocks, siliceous sedimentary rocks, and their metamorphic equivalents. Carbonates and evaporites show a depletion to the crustal average of Ge. There is a tendency for Ge to be slightly enriched in silicate minerals of late magmatic differentiates (e.g., muscovite granites), rocks that crystallize in the presence of a high volatile concentration (e.g., pegmatites, greisens) and late hydrothermal fluids, accounting for ore deposits. Ge does not form specific ore deposits; rather it occurs in trace and minor amounts in various ore deposit types. Grades of a few tens to several hundred ppm Ge are known in sulphide deposits: volcanic-hosted, massive sulphide Cu-Zn(-Pb)(-Ba) deposits; porphyry and vein-stockwork Cu-Mo-Au deposits; porphyry and vein-stockwork Sn-Ag deposits; vein-type Ag-Pb-Zn deposits; sediment-hosted, massive sulphide Zn-Pb-Cu(-Ba) deposits; carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb deposits, and polymetallic, Kipushi-type Cu-Pb-Zn-Ge deposits. Low-iron sphalerite is the most important of all minerals containing Ge. Other sulphur minerals, e.g., enargite, bornite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, luzonite, sulvanite, and colusite, are significant Ge sources in some deposits. At high S activities, the thiocomplex [GeS4] 4- can give rise to the formation of thiogermanate minerals, e.g., argyrodite, briartite, renierite, and germanite, which can form elevated Ge concentrations, above all in Kipushi-type deposits. Ge concentrations due to sorption processes in iron hydroxides and oxides refer to those in oxidation zones of sulphide ore deposits, especially at the Apex Mine, USA, and Tsumeb, Namibia, as well as to iron oxide ores, particularly in banded iron formations (BIF). Lignite and coal deposits show germanium grades that vary by several orders of magnitude, both regionally and within particular deposits, from levels less than the Ge abundance in the Earth's crust up to a few thousands ppm Ge. This Ge enrichment is effected by chemisorptive processes on relatively stable organo-complexes, e.g., lignin and humic acids. Currently, Ge is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite ores, especially from sediment-hosted, massive Zn-Pb-Cu(-Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb deposits, from polymetallic Kipushi-type deposits, and lignite and coal deposits in China and Russia.

abstract = {More than 50 per cent of the Earth's upper mantle consists of olivine and it is generally thought that mantle-derived melts are generated in equilibrium with this mineral. Here, however, we show that the unusually high nickel and silicon contents of most parental Hawaiian magmas are inconsistent with a deep olivine-bearing source, because this mineral together with pyroxene buffers both nickel and silicon at lower levels. This can be resolved if the olivine of the mantle peridotite is consumed by reaction with melts derived from recycled oceanic crust, to form a secondary pyroxenitic source. Our modelling shows that more than half of Hawaiian magmas formed during the past 1 Myr came from this source. In addition, we estimate that the proportion of recycled (oceanic) crust varies from 30 per cent near the plume centre to insignificant levels at the plume edge. These results are also consistent with volcano volumes, magma volume flux and seismological observations.},

@article{Comin-Chiaramonti2007,
abstract = {Mesozoic to Cenozoic allkaline-carbonatitic complexes from southern Brazil, Angola and Nambia occur along main tectonic lineaments. In general, the alkaline-carbonatite complexes show intrusive/subintrusive, subcircular or oval shaped structures and are indicative of high upwelling energy. Processes of liquid immiscibility from trachytic-phonolitic liquids, starting from parental alkaline mafic magmas are believed to have generated carbonatitic liquids, as suggested by field relationships and geochemical characteristics. Ca-, Mg- and Fe-carbonatites are widespread even in the same complex. The occurrences comprise three main chronogroups, i.e. 1) Early Cretaceous (Eastern Paraguay; Brazil, Ponta Grossa Arch and Anit{\'{a}}polis; Angola and Namibia); 2) Late Cretaceous (Brazil, Ponta Grossa Arch, Lages and Alto Parana{\'{i}}ba; Namibia); 3) Paleogene, Brazil and Namibia. Two principal types of associated alkaline rocks are represented, i.e. plagioleucitites l.s. (Eastern Paraguay; Brazil: Ponta Grossa Arch; Angola and Namibia) and kamafugites l.s. (Brazil: Alto Parana{\'{i}}ba and Lages; Namibia). Significant variations in O-C isotope compositions are found in primary carbonates, the variations being mainly due to isotope exchange between carbonates and H2O-CO2-rich hydrothermal fluids, whereas magmatic processes, i.e. fractional crystallization or liquid immiscibility, probably affect the $\delta$ 18O and $\delta$13C values by not more than 2$\delta$‰. The isotope exchange model implies that the most significant isotopic variations took place in a hydrothermal environment, e.g. in the range 400-80°C, involving fluids with CO2/H2O ratio ranging from 0.8 to 1. Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics highlight heterogeneous mixtures between HIMU and EMI mantle components, similar to the associated alkaline rocks and the flood tholeiites of the Paran{\'{a}}-Angola-Etendeka (Namibia) system. This is also consistent with Re-Os systematics on selected mafic samples from the Alto Parana{\'{i}}ba alkaline-carbonatite province.The data relative to the noble gases suggest that the source(s) are similar to other mantle derived magmas (e.g. HIMU and MORB) and that the carbon of carbonatites is unlikely to be subduction-related carbon, and support a C-O fractionation model starting from mantle-derived sources. In spite of the strong variation shown by C-O isotopes, Sr-Nd-Pb-Os isotopic systematics could be related to an isotopically enriched source where the chemical heterogeneities reflect a depleted mantle “metasomatized” by small-volume melts and fluids rich in incompatible elements. These fluids are expected to have promoted crystallization in the mantle of K-rich phases that gave rise to a veined network variously enriched in LILE and LREE (cf. Foley, 1992b). The newly formed veins (enriched component) and peridotite matrix (depleted component) underwent a different isotopic evolution with time as reflected by the carbonatitic rocks. These conclusions may be extended to the whole Paran{\'{a}}-Angola-Etendeka system, where isotopically distinct parent magmas were generated following two main enrichment events of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle at 2.0-1.4 and 1.0-0.5 Ga, respectively, as also supported by Re-Os systematics. The mantle sources preserved the isotopic heterogeneities over a long time, suggesting a non-convective lithospheric mantle beneath different cratons or intercratonic regions. Overall the data indicate that the alkaline-carbonatitic magmatism originated from a significant, but small scale heterogeneous subcontinental mantle. In this scenario, the Tristan da Cunha, Walvis Ridge-Rio Grande Rise and Vit{\'{o}}ria-Trindade hotspot tracks might reflect the accomodation of stresses in the lithosphere during rifting, rather than continuous magmatic activity induced by mantle plumes beneath the moving lithosphere.},

abstract = {A variety of granitoid suites, which have been classified as A-types, are reviewed in this paper. Based on this review, the general characteristics of the A-type granitoids are summarized as follows. The A-type granitoid suites vary in composition from quartz syenites to peralkaline granites and their respective volcanic equivalents. These suites are emplaced into non-orogenic settings — both within plate and along plate margins during the waning stages of subduction-zone-related magmatism. With respect to I- and S-type granitoids, the A-types are characterized by their relatively high alkali contents and low CaO contents (at SiO2 = 70{\%}: Na2O + K2O = 7−11{\%}, CaO {\textless} 1.8{\%}), high {\textless}img height="31" border="0" style="vertical-align:bottom" width="84" alt="View the MathML source" title="View the MathML source" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-002449379090043Z-si1.gif"{\textgreater} ratios (at SiO2 = 70{\%}: {\textless}img height="31" border="0" style="vertical-align:bottom" width="153" alt="View the MathML source" title="View the MathML source" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-002449379090043Z-si2.gif"{\textgreater}), and often elevated halogen, particularly F, contents (F = 0.05−1.7{\%}). The major element chemistry is reflected in the mineralogy by the occurrence of iron-rich micas, amphiboles and pyroxenes and in the peralkaline varieties by the occurrence of alkali-rich amphiboles and pyroxenes. Trace element abundances, particularly elevated concentrations of high-field-strength cations, are distinctive. {\textless}img height="30" border="0" style="vertical-align:bottom" width="45" alt="View the MathML source" title="View the MathML source" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-002449379090043Z-si3.gif"{\textgreater} and {\textless}img height="30" border="0" style="vertical-align:bottom" width="50" alt="View the MathML source" title="View the MathML source" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-002449379090043Z-si4.gif"{\textgreater} ratios are relatively constant for each A-type suite and thus serve as useful indices for chemical comparisons.

In combination with isotopic and other trace element data, these relationships suggest that A-type granitoids are generated by a variety of processes including fractionation from mantle-derived basaltic magmas, interaction between these mantle-derived magmas and continental crust and in some cases by the formation of anatectic, halogen-rich, melts during the remelting of a terrane from which a previous melt had been extracted.},

abstract = {The Neoproterozoic (ca. 723 Ma) Franklin large igneous province (LIP) located on Victoria Island, Arctic Canada, consists of the Natkusiak Formation continental flood basalts and a sill-dominated feeder system exposed in the Minto Inlier. The Franklin LIP is temporally linked with the breakup of Laurentia from Siberia and the Sturtian glaciation or “Snowball Earth”. Recent mapping shows that the Natkusiak Formation, preserved in two lobes (northern and southern), has a thin basal unit, {\~{}}50 m thick, followed by two {\~{}}500 m thick cycles (1 and 2) of basaltic sheet-flows. Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions, major element oxides, and trace element concentrations of the Natkusiak basalts allow for the characterization of mantle source components and the extent of crustal contamination. Four geochemical groups (southern low- and high-Ti basalts; northern low- and high-Ti basalts) are defined. The basal basalts (low-Ti, 1.0-1.2 wt.{\%} TiO2) are distinguished from the overlying cycle 1 and 2 basalts (high-Ti, 1.2-1.8 wt.{\%} TiO2). The high-Ti basalts are characterized by a narrow range in 87Sr/86Sri (0.7027- 0.7045), ␣␣␣␣␣␣Ndi ␣␣␣␣␣Hfi, and relatively low 206Pb/204Pbi, 207Pb/204Pbi, and 208Pb/204Pbi compared to the low-Ti basalts (87Sr/86Sri = 0.7033-0.7057). The northern (low- and high-Ti) basalts are isotopically distinct from the southern (low- and high-Ti) basalts with lower ␣Ndi values for a given 87Sr/86Sri. The chemistry of the coeval Franklin intrusions mainly overlaps that of the northern basalts and they show only limited isotopic correlation with the southern basalts, which indicates that the southern basalts were fed from a separate feeder system. Significant major and trace element and isotopic differences between the low- and high-Ti basalts are inconsistent with the effects of crustal contamination and are related to different mantle source compositions, with a garnet-bearing source for the low-Ti basalts and a spinel-bearing source for the high-Ti basalts. A shift in mantle source region, likely reflected by an episode of syn-volcanic extension, occurred after the emplacement of the low-Ti basalts, which represent the earliest volcanic products of the Franklin LIP.},

Furthermore, the closed system B-isotopic evolution of the experimental fluid was modelled by Rayleigh fractionation. The model results are in excellent agreement with the measured B-isotope composition of the run-product fluid. Consequently, low-element-excess experiments are proposed as an ideal approach to determine fluid-solid isotope fractionation factors for systems that are characterised by Rayleigh fractionation.},

abstract = {Cooling and decompression experiments have been carried out on trachytic melts in order to investigate crystallization kinetics of alkali feldspar, the effect of the degree of undercooling ($\Delta$T = T liquidus − T experimental) and time on nucleation and crystal growth process. This experimental work gives us new data about crystallization kinetics of trachytic melts, and it that will be useful to better understand the natural system of Campi Flegrei volcanoes. Experiments have been conducted using cold seal pressure vessel apparatus, at pressure between 30 and 200 MPa, temperature between 750 and 855 °C, time between 7,200 and 57,600 s and redox condition close to the NNO +0.8 buffer. These conditions are ideal to reproducing pre- and syn-eruptive conditions of the Campi Flegrei volcanoes, where the “conditions” pertain to the complete range of pressures, temperatures and time at which the experiments were performed. Alkali feldspar is the main phase present in this trachyte, and its abundance can strongly vary with small changes in pressure, temperature and water content in the melt, implying appreciable variations in the textures and in the crystallization kinetics. The obtained results show that crystallization kinetics are strictly related to $\Delta$T, time, final pressure, superheating (−$\Delta$T) and water content in the melt. $\Delta$T is the driving force of the crystallization, and it has a strong influence on nucleation and growth processes. In fact, the growth process dominates crystallization at small $\Delta$T, whereas the nucleation dominates crystallization at large $\Delta$T. Time also is an important variable during crystallization process, because long experiment durations involve more nucleation events of alkali feldspar than short experiment durations. This is an important aspect to understand magma evolution in the magma chamber and in the conduit, which in turn has strong effects on magma rheology.},

abstract = {As a result of the present paper, the most probable formula unit of eudialyte is: (Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn, Mg)3Zr3(Zr, Nb) x (Ca, R.E.)6Na12[Si9O27−y (OH) y ]2[Si3O9]2Cl z withx=0.1−0.9;y=1−3;z=0.7−1.4. Space group:R 3ˉ$\backslash$bar 3 a;a=14.244 {\AA},c=30.080 {\AA},Z=3. The crystal structure was determined from 3-dimensional Weissenberg data by Patterson- and electron density-syntheses, and refined by the least squares method:R=0.075 for 831 obs. reflections. Eudialyte is a cyclosilicate with both threefold and ninefold rings of SiO4-tetrahedra. Si−O distances measure 1.62–1.65 {\AA} (for shared oxygens) and 1.58–1.60 {\AA} (for unshared oxygens). Zirconium has a practically regular octahedral coordination (Zr−O=2.07–2.08 {\AA}), whereas iron is surrounded by only four oxygens in a square arrangement (Fe−O=2.04 {\AA}); the coordination polyhedron of calcium is a distorted octahedron (Ca−O=2.33–2.38 {\AA}). Two non equivalent sodium atoms have rather irregular coordinations: Na(1) is bound to six oxygens which form a fairly distorted hexagonal ring (Na−O=2.53–2.66 {\AA}), whereas Na(2) has four shorter distances to three oxygens (Na−O=2.53–2.57 {\AA}) and one chlorine (Na−Cl=2.98 {\AA}), and three longer distances to oxygens (Na−O=2.74–2.77 {\AA}) in a sort of distorted octahedron with a centered face. Some of the most reliable chemical analyses are reexamined in order to derive a formula unit consistent with the crystal structure and to confirm some of its peculiar features, e.g. the presence of two sets of crystallographic sites only partially occupied by chlorine and zirconium atoms respectively.},

abstract = {The distribution of geochemical species in the Earth's interior is largely controlled by fractional melting and crystallization processes that are intimately linked to the thermal state and evolution of the mantle. The existence of patches of dense partial melt at the base of the Earth's mantle, together with estimates of melting temperatures for deep mantle phases and the amount of cooling of the underlying core required to maintain a geodynamo throughout much of the Earth's history, suggest that more extensive deep melting occurred in the past. Here we show that a stable layer of dense melt formed at the base of the mantle early in the Earth's history would have undergone slow fractional crystallization, and would be an ideal candidate for an unsampled geochemical reservoir hosting a variety of incompatible species (most notably the missing budget of heat-producing elements) for an initial basal magma ocean thickness of about 1,000 km. Differences in 142Nd/144Nd ratios between chondrites and terrestrial rocks can be explained by fractional crystallization with a decay timescale of the order of 1 Gyr. These combined constraints yield thermal evolution models in which radiogenic heat production and latent heat exchange prevent early cooling of the core and possibly delay the onset of the geodynamo to 3.4-4 Gyr ago.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces and some hotspot volcanoes are thought to form above thermochemical anomalies known as mantle plumes. Petrologic investigations that support this model suggest that plume-derived melts originated at high mantle temperatures (greater than 1,500[thinsp][deg]C) relative to those generated at ambient mid-ocean ridge conditions (about 1,350[thinsp][deg]C). Earth/'s mantle has also cooled appreciably during its history and the temperatures of modern mantle derived melts are substantially lower than those produced during the Archaean (2.5 to 4.0 billion years ago), as recorded by komatiites (greater than 1,700[thinsp][deg]C). Here we use geochemical analyses of the Tortugal lava suite to show that these Galapagos-Plume-related lavas, which formed 89 million years ago, record mantle temperatures as high as Archaean komatiites and about 400[thinsp][deg]C hotter than the modern ambient mantle. These results are also supported by highly magnesian olivine phenocrysts and Al-in-olivine crystallization temperatures of 1,570 [plusmn] 20[thinsp][deg]C. As mantle plumes are chemically and thermally heterogeneous, we interpret these rocks as the result of melting the hot core of the plume head that produced the Caribbean large igneous province. Our results imply that a mantle reservoir as hot as those responsible for some Archaean lavas has survived eons of convection in the deep Earth and is still being tapped by mantle plumes.},

abstract = {The transport, degassing and atmospheric release of halogens from active volcanism on Earth have been the focus of increasing interest over the last few decades, and have recently been the subject of the 1st workshop on "Halogens in volcanic systems and their environmental impacts" that was held in December of 2007 at Yosemite Lodge in Yosemite National Park, California. As an introduction to this Chemical Geology special issue, collecting contributions from many of the participants at the workshop, we review here recent advances in this field, including experimental and theoretical investigations of halogen behaviour in volcanic and related magmatic systems. We discuss previous research on several aspects of halogen geochemistry, including halogen abundances in the mantle and magmas on Earth; the effects of halogens on phase equilibria and melt viscosities; their partitioning between melt and fluid phase(s) upon decompression, cooling and crystallisation of magmas in the Earth's crust; and their final atmospheric release as volcanic gases. The role of halogens in the genesis of hydrothermal systems and in the transport of ore-forming metals is also reviewed, and we discuss our current understanding of atmospheric processing of volcanic halogens in both the troposphere and stratosphere, and their consequent impacts. In spite of these recent advancements, our current understanding of halogen geochemistry at active volcanoes is still far too fragmentary, and the key questions that require answers from future research are summarised in our conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Soldier Meadow Tuff (SMT) consists mostly of a voluminous sheet of distinctive phenocryst-rich comendite ash-flow tuff distributed around the eastern to southern margin of the High Rock caldera (HRC), source of the 16.3 Ma Summit Lake Tuff. The SMT is a lithologically complex single cooling unit composed of several repetitions of planar and cross-bedded surges, lag-breccias, and massive lithofacies. Stratigraphic repetition of these deposits suggests the SMT erupted in several, closely-spaced pulses, each of which developed eruption columns and column collapses. The HRC is the likely source of the SMT, which erupted approximately 16.1 Ma. The ash-flow sheet of the SMT thins away from ring fracture vents, and pumice imbrications and surge deposits indicate southeast flow away from the HRC. Eruption of the SMT may have caused additional caldera collapse as indicated by aeromagnetic lows in the southeastern part of the HRC. Collinear trends of major element-oxides, trace elements, and rare earth elements genetically link Summit Lake Tuff, Soldier Meadow Tuff, Soldier Meadow lavas, and post-Soldier Meadow pyroclastic and lava units to a common magmatic source, likely a continental tholeitte. The magma evolved through typical crystal fractionation processes.},

abstract = {The unusually large Meme-Casseus and Bassin assimilation zones surround marble blocks in the 66 m.y.-old, epizonal Terre-Neuve quartz monzonite of northern Haiti. The Meme-Casseus zone, which contains syenodiorite, granodiorite, and minor nepheline syenite, occupies more volume than did the marble block. Therefore, dispersal, as well as addition, of material was required to form the contaminated zones. Mechanisms of addition of material to a magma can include congruent or incongruent melting of wall rock at normal or depressed melting points followed by solution of the melted material, or solution of solid rock by the magma. At the Meme-Casseus zone, minor melting may have occurred, but solution of solid marble was the dominant addition mechanism. Dispersal can take place by diffusion, crystal sinking, or convection, and at Meme-Casseus dispersal was caused largely by convection. The relation of addition to dispersal at the Meme-Casseus assimilation zone suggests that the formation of large assimilation zones is controlled by the mechanism of dispersal of material.},

abstract = {Late Neoproterozoic (ca. 580Ma), high-K, mafic-intermediate rocks represent voluminous bimodal magmatism in the Borborema Province, northeast Brazil. These rocks show the following chemical signatures that reflect derivation from a subduction-modified lithospheric mantle source: (1) enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (Rb, Ba, K, Th) and light rare-earth elements (REE) (La/YbCN=11–70), (2) pronounced negative Nb anomalies, and (3) radiogenic Sr (0.71202–0.7059) and unradiogenic Nd ($\epsilon$Nd from −9.3–−20.1) isotopic compositions. TDM model ages suggest that modification of the lithospheric mantle source (metasomatised garnet lherzolite) may have occurred in the Paleoproterozoic during the Transamazonian/Eburnean tectonics that affected the region. Interaction with asthenospheric fluids is believed to have partially melted this enriched source in the Neoproterozoic, probably as a result of asthenosphere-derived fluid percolation in the Brasiliano/Pan-African shear zones that controlled the emplacement of these mafic-intermediate magmas. The involvement of this asthenospheric component is supported by the nonradiogenic Pb isotopic ratios (206Pb/204Pb=16–17.3, 207Pb/204Pb=15.1–15.6, 208Pb/204Pb=36–37.5), which contrast with the enriched Sr and Nd compositions and thereby suggest the decoupling of Rb–Sr, Sm–Nd, and U–Pb systems at the time of intrusion of the mafic-intermediate magmas in the crust.},

abstract = {We test two methods of 3-D acoustic source localization on volcanic explosions and small-scale jetting events at Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia. Recent infrasound studies have provided evidence that volcanic jets produce low-frequency aerodynamic sound (jet noise) similar to that from man-made jet engines. For man-made jet noise, noise sources localize along the turbulent jet flow downstream of the nozzle. Discrimination of jet noise sources along the axis of a volcanic jet requires high resolution in the vertical dimension, which is very difficult to achieve with typical volcano-acoustic network geometries. At Karymsky Volcano, an eroded edifice (Dvor Caldera) adjacent to the active cone provided a platform for the deployment of five infrasound sensors in July 2012 with intra-network relief of {\~{}} 600 m. The network was designed to target large-scale jetting, but unfortunately only small-scale jetting and explosions were recorded during the 12-day experiment. A novel 3-D inverse localization method, srcLoc, is tested and compared against a more common grid-search semblance technique. Simulations using synthetic signals show that srcLoc is capable of determining vertical solutions to within ± 150 m or better (for signal-to-noise ratios ≥ 1) for this network configuration. However, srcLoc locations for explosions and small-scale jetting at Karymsky Volcano show a persistent overestimation of source elevation and underestimation of sound speed. The semblance method provides more realistic source locations, likely because it uses a fixed, realistic sound speed of {\~{}} 340 m/s. Explosion waveforms exhibit amplitude relationships and waveform distortion strikingly similar to those theorized by modeling studies of wave diffraction around the crater rim. We suggest that the delay of acoustic signals and apparent elevated source locations are due to raypaths altered by topography and/or crater diffraction effects, implying that topography in the vent region must be accounted for when attempting 3-D volcano acoustic source localization. Though the data presented here are insufficient to resolve small-scale jet noise sources, similar techniques may be successfully applied to large volcanic jets in the future.},

abstract = {Eight samples of pantelleritic lava and tuff and a lithic inclusion of trachyte from Pantelleria, Italy, have been thoroughly analyzed with an electron microprobe. These samples reveal five different mineral assemblages if classified by the presence of fayalite, aenigmatite, ilmenite, and magnetite: (1) augite + fayalite + ilmenite + magnetite, (2) augite + fayalite + ilmenite, (3) hedenbergite or sodian hedenbergite + fayalite + ilmenite + aenigmatite + quartz, (4) sodian hedenbergite or aegirine-augite + ilmenite + aenigmatite + quartz ± ferrorichterite, and (5) aegirine-augite + aenigmatite + quartz. Alkali feldspar (Or35–37) is present as the dominant phyric phase in each assemblage. Whole-rock silica and peralkalinity correlate strongly with the mineral assemblage: assemblage 1 is found in the sample with the lowest agpaitic index [A.I. = molar (Na + K)/Al] and silica concentration (A.I. {\textless} 1.31, SiO2 {\textless} 64.8 wt{\%}) and equilibrated at 991–888°C at an oxygen fugacity between 0.7 and 1.1 log units below the FMQ buffer (FMQ – 0.7 to FMQ – 1.1). Assemblage 2 is associated with a higher agpaitic index and silica concentration (A.I. = 1.42, SiO2 = 67.1{\%}) and equilibrated at {\~{}}794°C at FMQ – 0.5. Assemblage 3 is associated with a still higher agpaitic index and silica concentration (A.I. in the range 1.55 – 1.63, 66.8 {\textless} SiO2 {\textless} 67.8{\%}) and equilibrated at 764–756°C at FMQ – 0.5 to FMQ – 0.2. Assemblage 4 is associated with a slightly higher agpaitic index and yet higher silica concentration (1.61 {\textless} A.I {\textless} 1.75, 67.6 {\textless} SiO2 {\textless} 72.0{\%}) and equilibrated between 740–700°C at oxygen fugacities at or just below the FMQ buffer. Assemblage 5 is associated with the highest agpaitic index and highest concentration of silica (A.I. = 1.97, SiO2 = 69.7{\%}) and equilibrated at {\textless}700°C at an oxygen fugacity just above the FMQ buffer in a “no-oxide” field. Despite the paucity of two-oxide, two-pyroxene, or two-feldspar pairs, it may be possible to accurately constrain temperature and oxygen fugacity in peralkaline rocks with QUIlF equilibria given an equilibrium assemblage of fayalite, ilmenite, and clinopyroxene.},

abstract = {A new technique for interpretation of 3-D seismic tomographic models in terms of temperature, degree of partial melt and rock composition is presented and tested. We consider both anharmonic and anelastic temperature effects on seismic velocities as well as the effects of mineral reactions, composition and partial melt. It is shown that composition effect is small (less than 1{\%} of velocity) if there are no strongly depleted, Mg-rich harzburgites. We calculate anharmonic temperature derivatives of seismic velocities from compositions of mantle xenoliths. The parameters of a non-linear frequency and temperature-dependent model of attenuation have been taken from published laboratory experiments and calibrated using global Q observations in the upper mantle. For every block of the tomographic model we calculate the absolute temperature and melt fraction required to fit the observed Vp perturbation, the average temperature of the tomographic layer being constrained by the observed surface heat flow. With these temperatures we calculate attenuation, density, Vp and Vs from petrophysical modelling, using the average for 80 mantle xenoliths samples from the French Massif Central. The technique is applied to a recently published 3-D teleseismic P wave tomographic model of the upper mantle beneath the French Massif Central. The observed velocity perturbations are probably caused there by variations in temperature. Temperature does not reach the dry solidus temperature (except for a few tomographic blocks), although it comes close to it at the depth of 60–100 km below volcanic areas. At high subsolidus temperatures the contribution of anelasticity to velocity perturbations is at least as important as the combined effect of anharmonicity and mineral reactions. Our model is consistent with the Pn velocities from refraction seismic studies, QS estimations from surface waves, observed gravity, geoid, topography and surface heat flow, as well as with the composition and temperatures derived from mantle xenoliths. We suggest that the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is uplifted to 50–60 km depth beneath the main volcanic fields. The central and southern part of the Massif Central is underlain by the hot mantle body (plume?) with a potential temperature that is 100–200°C higher than the average potential temperature of the upper mantle.},

abstract = {Chromitites from layered mafic intrusions are of great economic importance, yet the origin of these deposits remains enigmatic. We describe multiphase silicate inclusions trapped within chromite grains from the G chromitite seam of the Stillwater Complex, Montana, United States. These inclusions are interpreted to represent melt trapped during chromite growth and hence provide information on chromitite formation. Most reheated inclusions have variable quench textures and chemical compositions that are consistent with variable degrees of mixing between a high-Mg basaltic parental magma and a Na-rich trondhjemitic melt. The trondhjemite is suggested to derive from partial melting of mafic or metasedimentary country rocks. Based on these inclusions, we outline a model for chromitite formation involving ponding of a new pulse of primitive magma at the roof of the Stillwater magma chamber, followed by localized partial melting and assimilation of the country rock. The newly formed hybrid melts become oversaturated in chromite, leading to extensive chromite crystallization. Chromitite horizons are proposed to form from dense chromite-rich plumes that periodically sink down from the roof zone to settle out as layers at the basal cumulate mush zone. Numerous radiogenic isotope studies, together with the widespread occurrence of similar multiphase inclusions in chromite from other cumulate complexes, indicate that assimilation of country rock by primitive magma may be a critical mechanism for forming chromitites in many layered intrusions.},

abstract = {The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia is the most nickel-sulfide-endowed komatiite belt in the world. The Agnew–Wiluna greenstone belt contains two mineralised units/horizons that display very different volcanological and geochemical features. The Mt Keith unit comprises {\textgreater}500 m-thick spinifex-free adcumulate-textured lenses, which are flanked by laterally extensive orthocumulate-textured units. Spinifex texture is absent from this unit. Disseminated nickel sulfides, interstitial to former olivine crystals, are concentrated in the lensoidal areas. Massive sulfides are locally present along the base or margins of the lenses or channels. The Cliffs unit is locally {\textgreater}150 m thick and comprises a sequence of differentiated spinifex-textured flow units. The basal unit is the thickest, and contains basal massive nickel-sulfide mineralisation. The Mt Keith and Cliffs units display important common features: (i) MgO contents of 25–30{\%} in inferred parental magmas; and (ii) Al/Ti ratios of ∼20 (Munro-type). However, the Mt Keith unit is highly crustally contaminated (e.g. LREE-enriched, high HFSEs), whereas the Cliffs unit does not display evidence of significant crustal assimilation. We argue that the distinct trace-element concentrations and profiles of the two komatiite units reflect their different emplacement style and country rocks: the Mt Keith unit is interpreted to have been emplaced as an intrusive sill into dacitic volcanic units whereas the Cliffs unit was extruded as lava flow onto tholeiitic basalts in a subaqueous environment. The mode of emplacement and nature of country rock is the single biggest factor in controlling mineralisation styles in komatiites. On the other hand, evidence of crustal contamination does not necessarily provide information of the prospectivity of komatiites to host Ni–Cu–(PGE) mineralisation, despite being a good proxy for the style of komatiite emplacement and the nature of country rocks.},

abstract = {Systematic regional sampling along the contact zone of the 1.85 Ga age Sudbury Igneous Complex with the Archean Levack Gneiss footwall in the North Range of the Sudbury structure revealed textural, mineralogical, and fluid inclusion systematics of post-Sudbury Igneous Complex hydrothermal processes that affected the various lithologies. At late stages of emplacement of the Sudbury Igneous Complex and formation of magmatic Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide deposits a partial melt from the Levack Gneiss invaded the contact zone. This partial melt is revealed by small microdikes and irregular bodies of granophyric quartz-plagioclase with megacrysts of hornblende, clinopyroxene, and titanite. Plagioclase-hornblende equilibrium was established at 750° to 800°C and 1.10 to 1.55 kbars pressure, corresponding to about a 4- to 6-km depth under lithostatic conditions. F/Cl wt percent ratios around 15 for accessory apatite and hornblende indicate that a Cl-rich fluid phase separated during the crystallization of the footwall granophyre: this is expressed as miarolites. The Cl-rich fluid (50 wt {\%} NaCl equiv salinity) was trapped as primary fluid inclusions in quartz at around 480°C minimum temperature and around 1.1 kbars minimum pressure during supercooling. These inclusions are rich in Ca, Fe, Mn, and K, as well as Na chloride. This fluid may have interacted with earlier primary magmatic sulfide, causing remobilization and reprecipitation of Cu-Ni-platinum-group elements (PGE) in veins and disseminations in the footwall. These veins are parallel to the Sudbury Igneous Complex-footwall contact and are characterized by chalcopyrite, pentlandite, millerite, magnetite, stilpnomelane, ferropyrosmalite, epidote, and chlorite. Michenerite, moncheite, merenskyite, froodite, insizwaite, sobolevskite, gold, and Bi-Ni sulfides are associated with sulfides. Epidote, quartz, actinolite, and chlorite are common in the alteration selvages of the veins. Compositions and assemblages of platinum-group minerals (PGM) indicate their precipitation below 575° to 485°C. Primary, highly saline fluid inclusions (about 40 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) in quartz indicate crystallization at 400° to 480°C and around 1.6 kbars minimum T and P, respectively. Late carbonate-epidote-actinolite-chlorite veins and alteration overprinted the earlier assemblages at about 300° to 400°C, with some bornite, millerite, native silver, and other Bi sulfides. The second stage of hydrothermal activity is characterized by regional carbonic-aqueous (NaCl-CO2-CH4-H2O-type) immiscible fluids that were trapped as secondary inclusions in quartz from various lithologies. No mineralization is related to this stage along the North Range. Boiling of these fluids took place during a pressure drop from lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions during uplift from about a 5- to 6- to a 3- to 4-km depth at 300° to 350°C. High- (20–26 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) and low-salinity (6–12 wt {\%} NaCl equiv) fluids coexisted with different carbonic species contents. The predominant north-south and northwest-southeast orientations of fluid inclusion planes reveal that mobilization of carbonic-aqueous solutions may be related to the northwesterly oriented thrusting in the Sudbury structure during the late stages (1.8–1.7 Ga) of the Penokean orogeny and to predominantly north-south faulting in the North Range. The third stage of fluid mobilization also took place mostly along northerly and northwesterly oriented fractures. Aqueous fluids were Ca-rich brines (20–40 wt {\%} salinity) with temperatures between 150° and 250°C. Some of these fluids also circulated in fractures parallel to the Sudbury Igneous Complex-footwall contact (NE-SW); thus, they locally may have interacted with the earlier sulfide assemblages and are also responsible for formation of late veinlets with chalcopyrite-epidote-quartz-chlorite assemblages. Mobilization of these fluids took place under litho- and hydrostatic conditions at about a 4- to 6-km depth. This hydrothermal activity is related to a regional tectonothermal event during emplacement of northwesterly oriented Sudbury dikes (1.24 Ga). Regional-scale fluid inclusion studies along the North Range highlight the role of multiple hydrothermal processes in the metallogenic evolution of the Sudbury Igneous Complex and especially in the distribution of copper and precious metals in the footwall units.},

Uranium deposits have been found in agpaitic rocks in Brazil (Po??os de Caldas), China (Saima) and Greenland (Il??maussaq), Nb and apetite deposits in Russia (Lovozero and Khibina). The type locality of agpaitic rocks, the Il??maussaq complex in south Greenland, is characterized by elevated contents of elements such as Zr, REE, Y, Be, Li, Nb, U, Th and F, not only in pegmatites, late veins and contact fenites, but also in some of the rocks, especially lujavrite and kakortokite.

abstract = {Trachybasalt scoria from a cinder cone near the Mexican volcanic front contain phenocrysts of olivine with chromite inclusions, apatite, augite and hornblende, with microphenocrysts of plagioclase. The water-saturated phase relations reproduce the phenocryst assemblage between 1040°C and 970°C with water contents of between 2{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (50–150 MPa). The absence of biotite phenocrysts in the scoria places a tight constraint on the pressure–temperature conditions of phenocryst equilibration, as there is only a small zone where biotite does not accompany hornblende in the experiments. Diluting the fluid phase with CO2 changes the composition of the olivine, indicating that CO2 was only a minor component of the fluid of the scoria. Hornblende is stable to 1040°C at oxygen fugacities of NNO + 2 (where NNO is the nickel–nickel oxide buffer), but at lower oxygen fugacities, the upper limit is 990°C. There is a progressive increase in crystallinity in experimental runs as both pressure and temperature decrease. Isobaric plots of crystallinity show that the onset of hornblende crystallization involves a reaction relation, and also results in a marked ∼15–40 vol. {\%} increase in crystallinity. Ascending hydrous magmas intersecting the cooler crust could be trapped there by the large increase in crystallinity accompanying the isobaric crystallization of hornblende.},

abstract = {Among the most significant challenges in maximizing the precision and accuracy of U-Pb zircon geochronology by LA-ICP-MS is minimizing the impact of downhole fractionation, the time-dependent evolution of Pb/U ratios caused mainly by complex differences in the volatility and chemical properties of elements as they are excavated from the ablation site. To produce meaningful dates for unknown materials, downhole fractionation is typically quantified in a reference zircon and a time-based correction factor subsequently employed to yield constant Pb/U in both standard and unknown zircons. This assumes that both the reference and unknown zircon exhibit similar downhole behaviour. As a test of this assumption, downhole fractionation trends were characterized and quantified in three common zircon reference materials (Ple{\v{s}}ovice, 337 Ma; Temora-2, 417 Ma; 91500; 1065 Ma) and in three low-U ({\textless} 300 ppm) zircon samples with coherent U-Pb systematics from mafic intrusions (Laramie, 1436 Ma; Bushveld, 2057 Ma; Stillwater, 2710 Ma). Using an exponential downhole correction model based on each of the untreated zircon reference materials, the corrections were applied to each of the “unknowns” and the resulting time-dependent Pb/U ratios and final ages were compared. The effectiveness of pre-treatment protocols was also evaluated by comparing downhole fractionation trends for untreated grains, annealed grains, and grains that were annealed and leached (i.e., chemical abrasion). Each of the three zircon reference materials exhibited distinct downhole fractionation and their calculated correction factors had variable influence in correcting each of the unknowns. Application of the fit parameters either over-corrected or under-corrected the Pb/U ratios of the unknowns due to differences in slope for the different downhole rates at a given time. In most cases, annealing zircon prior to LA-ICP-MS analysis lessened the magnitude of U-Pb mass fractionation during laser ablation, whereas chemical abrasion did not significantly change ablation behaviour beyond simply annealing the grains. Based on the relative effectiveness of the downhole correction that was applied, the resulting U-Pb dates of zircon from the Precambrian mafic intrusions can vary significantly when compared to the CA-ID-TIMS ages established for these samples. The results of this study indicate that a robust downhole correction method for LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology of zircon, particularly for application to magmatic zircon and igneous crystallization ages, involves characterization of downhole fractionation in different reference materials and then applying a correction to the unknown zircon based on a reference zircon that behaves similarly during ablation.},

abstract = {Diffusion of halogens has the potential to influence petrogenetic processes in magma chambers and conduit degassing processes. This contribution reviews our current state of knowledge concerning halogen diffusion and the influence of halogens on the diffusion of major elements in silicate melts. The addition of halogens to silicate melts at common, natural concentration levels will have little effect on the diffusion of major elements. However, the differences between the diffusivity of water, the diffusivities of halogens, and the diffusivity of sulfur are significant enough that during melt inclusion entrapment, or during rapid bubble or crystal growth, diffusive fractionation between water and the halogens, and between halogens and sulfur, are expected to occur and can influence the compositions of melt inclusions, crystals and volcanic gases. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sodic basalts of Oligocene-Early Micene age occur within an Early Tertiary graben in the Oatlands district of Tasmania. They include olivine tholeiites, alkali olivine basalts, basanites, transitional nephelinites, nepheline hawaiites, and nepheline mugearites. They have compositional characteristics in common with sodic alkaline basalt suites from other parts of the world. With decreasing SiO2, concentrations of CaO, alkalis, P2O5, and incompatible trace elements increase. Compositional and experimental data for the basalts are consistent with their derivation by polybaric partial melting of a garnet lherzolite source enriched in P2O5, light rare earths, Nb, and other incompatible trace elements. Experimental data for a primitive nepheline basanite from the Oatlands district indicate that concentrations of H2O+CO2 need not have been more than 6{\textperiodcentered}5 wt.{\%} for the original basanite magma to have derived from an amphibole-bearing garnet lherzolite source. In the case of more SiO2-undersaturated olivine melilitites from the neighbouring Central Plateau, the experimental evidence is consistent with either higher concentrations of H2O+CO2 (approaching 14 wt.{\%}), or higher pressures of origin ({\textgreater}35 kb). Petrographic and geochemical evidence suggests that the latter is the more probable of the alternatives.},

abstract = {The geochronological evolution of early Archaean Amı̂tsoq gneisses from southern West Greenland is reassessed here using the well-established cathodoluminescence imaging method both to reveal previously undocumented complex zircon growth histories and to control positioning of ion-microprobe U–Th–Pb analyses. Several of the gneisses typically contain zircon grains with ≥3.8 Ga cores of igneous origin, mostly completely mantled by growth banded magmatic zircon at ca. 3.65 Ga and in turn partly mantled by late Archaean metamorphic overgrowths at ca. 2.7 Ga. The ≥3.8 Ga cores are regarded as inherited, with apparent dates ranging down to ca. 3.65 Ga reflecting differential Pb loss. This contrasts with published views interpreting ≥3.8 Ga dates as emplacement ages of the host rock to the zircons, with all younger ages representing later Pb loss and/or metamorphic recrystallisation. Two of the analysed gneisses have discordant relationships to metasedimentary enclaves containing accessory apatite with graphite inclusions whose C-isotope ratios have been considered as biogenic in origin. The present data show that the minimum age of the enclaves is 3.65 Ga and not 3.85 Ga as previously claimed. This has important implications for the current debate on the possibility of temporal overlap of earliest life with a bolide impact scenario terminating at ≥3.8 Ga (as on the moon). We also discuss the implication of the discovery of highly complex internal structures in Amı̂tsoq gneiss zircons for the interpretation of published, zircon-derived Lu–Hf information.},

Geochemists have investigated diffusion in silicate melts (including stable liquids and supercooled liquids and glasses) using a variety of methods as micro-analytical tools becoming available (e.g., Medford 1973; Jambon and Carron 1976; Magaritz and Hofmann 1978a,b; Hofmann 1980; Shimizu and Kushiro 1984; Zhang et al. 1991a; Koepke and Behrens 2001; Saal et al. 2008). The investigations were aimed at understanding the mechanisms of diffusion, the effect of temperature, pressure, H2O content, fO2, and more generally melt composition on the diffusivities, and to measure the diffusivity values for geological applications. A large database is now available. This chapter reviews diffusion data relevant to magmatic systems. The large body of literature on diffusion in simplesystem melts, of interests to glass and ceramic scientists, is not included in this review, nor are the calculated diffusivities from ab initio and molecular dynamics methods.},

Although weathering processes occur globally, no economic HREE resources of this type have yet been found outside China. Here, we report the occurrence of unidentified REE minerals in the granites from South Chinese deposits. They contain high levels of both HREE and light REE, but are strongly depleted in Ce, implying high oxidation state. These REE minerals show higher initial Nd isotope than primary REE-rich minerals (varepsilonNd(t)=0.9+/-0.8 versus -11.5+/-0.5). The mineralized weathering crusts inherited REE signature of the granites, but show more Ce depletion and more overall concentration of the REE. We propose, therefore, that highly oxidized, REE-rich fluids, derived from external, isotopically depleted sources, metasomatized the granites, which resulted in Ce depletion as Ce4+ and enrichment of the remaining REE, especially the HREE, contributing to formation of a globally important REE resource.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces form with massive flood basalts being erupted over a large region within a few million years. A prevailing model for their formation is a mantle plume model in which a plume head originates from the core–mantle boundary, ascends through the mantle, and produces topographic uplift and eventually massive melting at the surface. However, many geological observations indicate surface subsidence in the central region before or during flood basalt eruptions. In this study, we demonstrate that a plume head temporarily ponding below the 660-km phase change boundary causes significant subsidence at the Earth's surface over an extended period before the eruption, and that the loading from erupted basalts causes surface subsidence at the periphery of the eruption area that affects the environment for subsequent episodes of basalt eruptions. Our studies therefore demonstrate that the observed subsidence history in many flood basalt provinces is characteristic of the dynamics of mantle plumes and may be used as diagnostics for identifying plume-induced flood basalt events.},

abstract = {The Messum complex of NW Namibia, a part of the Paran{\'{a}}–Etendeka volcanic province, consists of a dominantly felsic central core, surrounded by older gabbros. The igneous rocks of the core can be divided, in order of decreasing age, into (1) a sub-alkaline suite, (2) an outer quartz syenite suite, and (3) an inner silica-undersaturated suite dominated by nepheline syenite. Compositional differences within the quartz syenite suite can be explained by fractional crystallization, but Sr- and O-isotope data indicate that these rocks contain a significant crustal component. The younger central nepheline syenites trend towards the 0.1 GPa phonolite minimum and appear to have evolved by closed system fractional crystallization of a mantle-derived magma, whereas earlier nepheline syenites appear to be contaminated with quartz syenite. The decreasing effects of crustal contamination with time may reflect progressive armouring of the magmatic plumbing system by less contaminated material. Basanite dykes that intrude the plutonic rock of the core show trace element and Nd- and Sr-isotope characteristics that are similar to those of basanites from Tristan da Cunha. This suggests that the mantle-derived component of the Messum core rocks came from the Tristan plume. },

The local environment around Zr in F-free glasses is characterized by two contributions, arising from O nearest neighbors ( ∼ 6 at 2.07–2.08 ± 0.01 {\AA}) and next-nearest Si neighbors at ∼ 3.68 ± 0.05 {\AA}. In the most highly polymerized glass (rhyolitic composition), the significantly larger mean ZrO distance (2.10 ± 0.01 {\AA}) and the appearance of ZrZr contributions at ∼ 3.67 ± 0.05 {\AA} are interpreted as evidence for the appearance of minor amounts of 8-coordinated Zr. In F-bearing albitic glass, no clear evidence was found for F first neighbors around Zr. Nonetheless, F is likely to affect the medium-range environment around Zr in this silicate glass because of the depolymerization induced by this halogen. The local structure around Zr in this set of glasses is very similar to that found in synthetic melts up to 1500 K and in natural glasses from various origins throughout the world. The possibility for REE-F complexes is also discussed.},

abstract = {The solubilities of zircon, rutile, manganocolumbite (MnNb2O6), manganotantalite (MnTa2O6), and the rare earth phosphates LaPO4, GdPO4, and YbPO4 in water-saturated haplogranitic melts containing 0–6 wt.{\%} F were measured at 800° C and 2 kbar. The melt compositions investigated differ only in their F content, the proportions of Na, K, Al, and Si are identical in all experiments. While the solubilities of the rare earth phosphates are independent of F, the solubilities of all other minerals studied strongly increase with F. The TiO2 content of haplogranitic melt in equilibrium with rutile increases linearly from 0.26 wt.{\%} without F to 0.47 wt.{\%} for melts containing 6 wt.{\%} F. Over the same range of F concentrations, the ZrO2 content of the melt in equilibrium with zircon increases with the square of the F content from less than 0.01 wt.{\%} to 0.25 wt.{\%}. The linear increase for rutile and the quadratic relationship for zircon suggest a complexing mechanism. Probably nonbridging oxygen atoms (NBO) expelled from coordination with Al by reaction with F form complexes with Ti and Zr, the ratio of NBO: metal cation being 1:1 for Ti, and 2:1 for Zr. Direct complexing by F is also a possibility. As titanium oxide phases and zircon are major sinks for HFS elements such as Ti, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Th and REE in granites, their increased solubility in the presence of F favors the enrichment of these elements in residual mels. The Nb and Ta content of rutile in granitic pegmatites is due to extended solid solution of rutile with columbite group minerals, such as manganocolumbite and manganotantalite. The solubility of these components also increases with F, MnTa2O6 being more soluble than MnNb2O6. Rutile fractionation could therefore account for the increase in Ta/Nb frequently observed in highly differentiated granites. The solubility of the rare earth phosphates increases strongly from LaPO4 to GdPO4 to YbPO4, which explains the enrichment of heavy rare earth elements in highly evolved granites. In the presence of F, many HFS elements will be highly incompatible in granitic systems. Therefore, in a suite of granitic rocks generated by differentiation from the same source magma, a strong correlation should exist between HFS elements and F. However, because of the influence of F on the solubility of refractory phases such as zircon, a similar correlation could also result from different batches of magma containing different amounts of F equilibrating with the same refractory phase.},

abstract = {In Tenerife, lavas of the recent Teide–Pico Viejo central complex show a marked bimodality in composition from initially mafic lavas (200–30 ka) to highly differentiated phonolites (30–0 ka). After this abrupt change, the bimodality of the lavas continued to manifest itself between the now felsic Teide–Pico Viejo central complex and the adjacent, but exclusively mafic, rift zones. Whole-rock trace element fingerprinting distinguishes three compositional groups (mafic, transitional, felsic). Groundmass Sr–Nd–Pb–O and feldspar $\delta$18O data demonstrate open-system behaviour for the petrogenesis of the Teide–Pico Viejo felsic lavas by high 87Sr/86Sr ratios of up to 0{\textperiodcentered}7049, uniform 206Pb/204Pb (19{\textperiodcentered}75–19{\textperiodcentered}78), variable 207Pb/204Pb (15{\textperiodcentered}53–15{\textperiodcentered}62) and heterogeneous $\delta$18O values (5{\textperiodcentered}43–6{\textperiodcentered}80‰). However, ocean sediment contamination can be excluded because of the low 206Pb/204Pb ratios of North Atlantic sediments. Isotope mixing hyperbolae reproduce the entire Teide–Pico Viejo succession and require an assimilant of predominantly felsic composition. Unsystematic and heterogeneous variation of $\delta$18O in fresh and unaltered feldspars across the Teide–Pico Viejo succession indicates magmatic addition of diverse $\delta$18O assimilants, altered near surface at high and low temperatures. The best fit for these requirements is provided by nepheline syenite that occurs as fresh or altered lithic blocks in voluminous pre-Teide ignimbrite deposits and is similarly heterogeneous in oxygen isotope composition. Nepheline syenite blocks are considered to represent deep remnants of associated earlier eruptions and were thus available for assimilation at depth. Rare earth element modelling indicates that nepheline syenite needs to be melted in bulk to form a suitable end-member composition. Using this assimilant, energy-constrained assimilation fractional crystallization (EC-AFC) modelling reproduces the bulk of the succession, which leads us to suggest that Teide–Pico Viejo petrogenesis is governed by assimilation and fractional crystallization. Both mixing hyperbolae and EC-AFC models indicate that assimilation is more pronounced for the more felsic lavas. The maximum assimilation is evident in the most strongly differentiated (and the most radiogenic in Sr) lava and computes to {\textgreater}97{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} of the assimilant. This most evolved eruption probably represents nepheline syenite bulk melts that formed spatially decoupled from juvenile material. This study therefore recognizes a wider variability of magmatic differentiation processes at Teide–Pico Viejo than previously thought.},

abstract = {Recent K-Ar dating of eruptions at Pantelleria, a peralkaline volcanic island in the Strait of Sicily, shows a correlation between eruption of pantellerite lavas from caldera ring fractures and low stands of sea level as determined from$\delta$ 18O stratigraphy. Post-caldera pantellerite lavas associated with an ∼ 114-ky-old caldera erupted along the ring-fracture zone during a major low stand of sea level at about 67 Ka. The most recent episode of lava-flow emplacement began about 20 ky ago during the last glacial maximum. Magma vented along the ring fault of a 45-ky-old caldera, from fractures radial to the caldera, and along faults formed by intracaldera trapdoor uplift. Two mechanical models based on elasticity theory are presented to explain the correlation of post-caldera ring-fracture eruptions at Pantelleria with lowering of sea level. A simple analysis of a bending circular plate of thickness,T r, and radius,R, representing the magma-chamber roof block, shows that tensile stress is concentrated by a factor of 0.75R 2/T r 2 at the lower perimeter of the plate when sea level drops. Stress changes may be even greater ifT r is effectively less than the stratigraphic thickness due to layering of rocks in the roof block. Calculated stress changes due to a 100-m drawdown of sea level are similar in magnitude to stresses associated with dike propagation. More realistic model geometries, including different chamber shapes, a conical volcanic edifice, and sea-level drawdown beyond the surface projection of the magma chamber, were tested using the boundary-element method. Lowering sea level generates a horizontal tensile stress above the chamber, even when sea water is removed outboard of the magma chamber. For some chamber geometries the magnitude of the tensile stress maximum is greater than the ∼ 1 MPa pressure of the 100 m of removed water and is of the right order of magnitude for dike propagation. Dikes initiated by the change of the stress field may originate and propagate along fractures inboard of the chamber margin. The magnitudes of tensile maxima along the top of the chamber decrease as original sea level is moved outboard of the chamber margin and as the chamber thickness decreases. When the depth to the top of the magma chamber reaches a critical value, dependent on chamber geometry, the propagation of dikes to the surface is inhibited.},

abstract = {Zircon and rutile are common accessory minerals whose essential structural constituents, Zr, Ti, and Si can replace one another to a limited extent. Here we present the combined results of high pressure–temperature experiments and analyses of natural zircons and rutile crystals that reveal systematic changes with temperature in the uptake of Ti in zircon and Zr in rutile. Detailed calibrations of the temperature dependencies are presented as two geothermometers—Ti content of zircon and Zr content of rutile—that may find wide application in crustal petrology. Synthetic zircons were crystallized in the presence of rutile at 1–2 GPa and 1,025–1,450°C from both silicate melts and hydrothermal solutions, and the resulting crystals were analyzed for Ti by electron microprobe (EMP). To augment and extend the experimental results, zircons hosted by five natural rocks of well-constrained but diverse origin (0.7–3 GPa; 580–1,070°C) were analyzed for Ti, in most cases by ion microprobe (IMP). The combined experimental and natural results define a log-linear dependence of equilibrium Ti content (expressed in ppm by weight) upon reciprocal temperature: log(Tizircon)=(6.01±0.03)−5080±30T(K).$\backslash$log ({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Ti{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}zircon{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}) = (6.01 $\backslash$pm 0.03) - $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}5080 $\backslash$pm 30{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}T$\backslash$;($\backslash$hbox{\{}K{\}}){\}}{\}}. In a strategy similar to that used for zircon, rutile crystals were grown in the presence of zircon and quartz (or hydrous silicic melt) at 1–1.4 GPa and 675–1,450°C and analyzed for Zr by EMP. The experimental results were complemented by EMP analyses of rutile grains from six natural rocks of diverse origin spanning 0.35–3 GPa and 470–1,070°C. The concentration of Zr (ppm by weight) in the synthetic and natural rutiles also varies in log-linear fashion with T −1: log(Zrrutile)=(7.36±0.10)−4470±120T(K).$\backslash$log ({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Zr{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}rutile{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}) = (7.36 $\backslash$pm 0.10) - $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}4470 $\backslash$pm 120{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}T$\backslash$;($\backslash$hbox{\{}K{\}}){\}}{\}}. The zircon and rutile calibrations are consistent with one another across both the synthetic and natural samples, and are relatively insensitive to changes in pressure, particularly in the case of Ti in zircon. Applied to natural zircons and rutiles of unknown provenance and/or growth conditions, the thermometers have the potential to return temperatures with an estimated uncertainty of ±10 ° or better in the case of zircon and ±20° or better in the case of rutile over most of the temperature range of interest (∼400–1,000°C). Estimates of relative temperature or changes in temperature (e.g., from zoning profiles in a single mineral grain) made with these thermometers are subject to analytical uncertainty only, which can be better than ±5° depending on Ti or Zr concentration (i.e., temperature), and also upon the analytical instrument (e.g., IMP or EMP) and operating conditions.},

abstract = {Fluorite is the most common fluoride mineral in magmatic silicic systems and its crystallization can moderate or buffer fluorine concentrations in these settings. We have experimentally determined fluorite solubility and speciation mechanisms in haplogranitic melts at 800-950 °C, 100 MPa and aqueous-fluid saturation. The starting haplogranite compositions: peraluminous (alumina saturation index, ASI = 1.2), subaluminous (ASI = 1.0) and peralkaline (ASI = 0.8) were variably doped with CaO or F2O-1 in the form of stoichiometric mineral or glass mixtures. The solubility of fluorite along the fluorite-hydrous haplogranite binaries is low: 1.054 ±0.085 wt.{\%} CaF2 (peralkaline), 0.822 ± 0.076 wt.{\%} (subaluminous) and 1.92 ± 0.15 wt.{\%} (peraluminous) at 800 °C, 100 MPa and 10 wt.{\%} H2O, and exhibits a minimum at ASI∼1. Fluorite saturation isotherms are strongly hyperbolic in the CaO+cF2O-1 space, suggesting that fluorite saturation is controlled by the activity product of CaO and F2O-1, i.e., these components are partially decoupled in the melt structure. The form of fluorite liquidus isotherms implies distinct roles of fluorite crystallization: in Ca-dominant systems, fluorite crystallization is controlled by the fluorine concentration in the melt only and remains nearly independent of calcium contents; in F-rich systems, the crystallization of fluorite is determined by CaO contents and it does not buffer fluorine concentration in the melt. The apparent equilibrium constant, K, for the equilibrium CaO + cF2O-1 = CaF2 (+ associates) is log K = -(2.449 ± 0.085) {\textperiodcentered} Al2O3
exc + (4.902 ± 0.066); the reaction-stoichiometry parameter varies as follows: c = -(0.92 ± 0.11) {\textperiodcentered} Al2O3
exc + (1.042 ± 0.084) at 800 °C, 100 MPa and fluid saturation where Al2O3
exc are molar percent alumina in excess over alkali oxides. The reaction stoichiometry, c, changes at subaluminous composition: in peralkaline melts, competition of other network modifiers for excess fluorine anions leads to the preferential alkali-F short-range order, whereas in peraluminous compositions, excess alumina associates with calcium cations to form calcioaluminate tetrahedra. The temperature dependence of fluorite solubility is described by the binary symmetric Margules parameter, W = 36.0 ± 1.4 kJ (peralkaline), 39.7 ± 0.5 kJ (subaluminous) and 32.8 ± 0.7 kJ (peraluminous). The strong positive deviations from ideal mixing imply the occurrence of CaF2-granite liquid-liquid immiscibility at temperatures above 1258 °C, which is consistent with previous experimental data. These experimental results suggest very low solubilities of fluorite in Ca-rich melts, consistent with the lack of fluorine enrichment in peralkaline rhyolites and calc-alkaline batholiths. On the other hand, high CaO concentrations necessary to crystallize fluorite in F-rich peraluminous melts are not observed in nature and thus magmatic crystallization of fluorite in topaz-bearing silicic suites is suppressed. A procedure for calculating fluorite solubility and the liquidus isotherms for a whole-rock composition and temperature of interest is provided. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Muskox intrusion was emplaced into a rift in the northwestern Canadian Shield at about 1270 Ma. This rifting event was associated with extensive flood basalt magmatism (Coppermine River basalt) and is attributed to the development of a mantle plume centered some 400 km north of the intrusion. Nickel-copper sulfides occur at the margins of the intrusion. The geologic setting of these sulfides is similar to that of a number of Ni-Cu sulfide deposits, such as those found in the Noril'sk-Talnakh area, the Duluth Complex, the Insizwa Complex, and the Cape Smith belt. Some of the marginal sulfides at Muskox are similar in composition to the Cu-PGE-rich Noril'sk-Talnakh sulfides and contain 16 percent Cu and up to 200ppm Pt + Pd + Au. However, most of the Muskox marginal sulfides were found to contain 3 to 10 percent Ni + Cu and intermediate levels of platinum-group elements (PGE) (1-10 ppm) similar to the Minnimax deposit of the Duluth Complex. The PGE content of the sulfides increases from the margins to the interior of the intrusion. This increase could be due to an increase in the ratio of silicate to sulfide liquid (R factor) during the crystallization of the intrusion. The high percentage of delta 34 S per mil of the sulfides indicates that the S in the sulfides was derived from the country rocks. Therefore, the amount of sulfide liquid that formed could have been controlled by the availability of S, which in turn was controlled by the distance from the contact with the country rock. Disseminated sulfides occur in association with a chromite-rich orthopyroxenite in the layered series of the Muskox intrusion. These sulfides have a strata-bound character similar to classic PGE reefs, such as the Merensky reef of the Bushveld intrusion. The sulfides from the Muskox reef unit contain only 1 to 10 ppm PGE, an order of magnitude less than sulfides from classic PGE reefs. The lower PGE content of the Muskox reef sulfides is attributed to a lower R factor; approximately 1,000 at Muskox versus greater than 10,000 for classical reefs. The sulfide-bearing rocks have higher Cu/Ni, Pd/Ir, Pd/Pt, and Rh/Ir ratios than sulfide-poor rocks. This is because the sulfides are enriched in Cu, Pd, and Rh to a greater degree than in Ni, Pt, and Ir. The difference in the degree of enrichment for these metals could be the result of Ni, Pt, and Ir having lower partition coefficients in sulfide liquid than Cu, Pd, and Rh; contamination of the Muskox magma with a partial melt of country rock; or a combination of these factors.},

abstract = {The Mid-Proterozoic composite Il??maussaq complex, South Greenland, is a classic locality to study magmatic layering in evolved peralkaline magmas. Most of the rock units show magmatic layering to differing extents, but 'kakortokites' - generally medium-grained agpaitic nepheline syenites - show a spectacular recurrence of black, red and white layers, which is due to regular changes in the modal contents of arfvedsonitic amphibole, eudialyte (sensu lato), alkali feldspar and nepheline, respectively. These three-layer units are found in the lower part of the intrusion and recur 29 times before grading into the overlying lujavrites (melanocratic agpaitic nepheline syenites), which are generally fine-grained and fissile with less-developed layering. The compositional trends observed in amphibole and eudialyte throughout the stratigraphic sequence reflect various processes including the chemical evolution of the melt by crystal fractionation, changes in the crystallising mineral assemblage and sub-solidus alteration. Eudialyte is the first mineral to crystallise in the investigated sequence and is therefore appropriate for recording evolution trends within the melt. Amphibole, on the other hand, always crystallises later and is therefore affected by other crystallising minerals. A detailed microprobe study of both minerals through the whole kakortokite stratigraphy displays surprisingly little change in mineral compositions within the kakortokites, but strong fractionation trends in the overlying lujavrites. Although various models have been proposed to explain the recurrence of the 29 rhythmic units, the origin of this prominent magmatic layering in the kakortokites and the lack of mineralogical and strong mineral chemical changes has not been quantitatively explained. We propose, that in the kakortokites, minerals were probably separated from each other as a result of their different densities. The interior cooled, resulting in crystallization but only a very small proportion of crystals (0.1-0.3{\%} for each of the four minerals) could remain suspended in the melt before gravity forced them to settle down in a stagnant layer of reduced convection. A combination of volatile pressure variations caused by eruptive activity and repeated replenishment can explain the oscillating liquidus temperature, the small changes in mineral compositions and such a process would produce enough crystals to form the 29 layers. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mesozoic igneous rocks are widespread throughout eastern China, but precise geochronological and petrogenetic constraints were previously lacking. Ten samples from the Liaodong Peninsula in northeastern China were chosen for zircon U-Pb SHRIMP and laser ablation ICP-MS dating. The magmatic ages range from 179 ±3 to 156 ± 3 Ma. Data compilation indicates that contemporaneous granitic magmatism is widespread throughout eastern China, establishing the Jurassic as an important period of igneous activity in eastern China. Petrographically, these granites can be divided into three groups that underwent a complex history of crystal fractionation. Two end-members of granodioritic and monzogranitic magma are identified. The granodioritic rocks, having lower (87Sr/86Sr)iand higher $\epsilon$Nd(t) values than those of the monzogranitic rocks, came from the partial melting of juvenile crust, whereas the monzogranitic rocks came from partial melting of the Precambrian basement. It is proposed that Pacific plate subduction resulted in crustal thickening and subsequent lithospheric delamination which resulted in the upwelling of asthenospheric mantle and formation of juvenile crust by underplating of mantle-derived magma in the lower crust. A subsequent underplating and heating event from the asthenosphere partially melted the overlying pre-existing underplated mafic rocks and ancient crust, leading to the formation of granodioritic and monzogranitic magmas. This thickening by subduction could have been a necessary precursor for limited delamination in the Jurassic and more extensive delamination in the Early Cretaceous. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report methane-dominant hydrocarbon (fluid) inclusions (CH4 +/- C2H6- C2H2, C3H8) coexisting with primary brine inclusions and secondary halide-melt (solid NaCl) inclusions in Au - Pt- rich quartz-sulfide-epidote alteration veins associated with the footwall-style Cu - PGE (platinum-group element) - Au deposits at the Fraser Mine ( North Range of the Sudbury Igneous Complex). Evidence for coentrapment of immiscible hydrocarbon - brine, and hydrocarbon halide melt mixtures is demonstrated. A primary CH4 brine assemblage was trapped during quartz growth at relatively low T (min. T-trapping similar to 145 - 315 degrees C) and P (max. P-trapping similar to 500 bar), prior to the crystallization of sulfide minerals in the veins. Secondary inclusions contain solid halite and a mixture of CH4, C2H6- C2H2 and C3H8 and were trapped at a minimum T of similar to 710 degrees C. The halite inclusions may represent halide-melt that exsolved from crystallizing sulfide ores that texturally postdate ( by replacement) early alteration quartz hosting the primary, lower T brine - CH4 assemblage. Laser ablation ICP-MS analyses show that the brine, hydrocarbon and halide-melt inclusions contain significant concentrations of Cu (0.1 - 1 wt{\%} range), Au, Bi, Ag and Pt ( all 0.1 - 10 ppm range). Cu: Pt and Cu: Au ratios in the inclusions are significantly ( up to 4 log units) lower than in the host alteration veins and adjacent massive sulfide ore veins, suggesting either ( 1) early Cu loss from the volatiles by chalcopyrite precipitation or ( 2) enhanced Au and Pt solubilities relative to Cu at the temperatures of entrapment. Concentration ratios between coexisting brine and CH4 inclusions [C-brine(elem)/C-CH4(elem)] are lower for Cu, Au, Bi and Ag than for other elements (Na, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb) indicating that during interaction with the brine, the hydrocarbon phase was enriched in ore metals. The high concentrations of ore metals in hydrocarbon, brine and halide-melt phases confirm that both aqueous and non-aqueous volatiles were carriers of precious metals in the Sudbury environment over a wide range of temperatures. Volatile evolution and magmatic sulfide differentiation were clearly part of a single, continuous process in the Sudbury footwall. The exsolution of H2O-poor volatiles from fractionated sulfide liquid may have been a principal mechanism controlling the final distribution of PGE and Au in the footwall ore systems. The study reports the fist measurements of precious metal concentrations in fluid inclusions from a magmatic Ni - Cu - PGE environment ( the Sudbury district).},

abstract = {Hydrothermal experiments were carried out at 2 kbar water pressure, 700 °–800 ° C, with the objective of determining the level of dissolved Zr required for precipitation of zircon from melts in the system SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O. The saturation level depends strongly upon molar (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 of the melts, with remarkably little sensitivity to temperature, SiO2 concentration, or melt Na2O/ K2O. For peraluminous melts and melts lying in the quartz-orthoclase-albite composition plane, less than 100 ppm Zr is required for zircon saturation. In peralkaline melts, however, zircon solubility shows pronounced, apparently linear, dependence upon (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3, with the amount of dissolvable Zr ranging up to 3.9 wt.{\%} at (Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 = 2.0. Small amounts (1 wt.{\%} each) of dissolved CaO and Fe2O3 cause a 25{\%} relative reduction of zircon solubility in peralkaline melts. The main conclusion regarding zirconium/zircon behavior in nature is that any felsic, non-peralkaline magma is likely to contain zircon crystals, because the saturation level is so low for these compositions. Zircon fractionation, and its consequences to REE, Th, and Ta abundances must, therefore, be considered in modelling the evolution of these magmas. Partial melting in any region of the Earth's crust that contains more than ∼ 100 ppm Zr will produce granitic magmas whose Zr contents are buffered at constant low ({\textless} 100 ppm) values; unmelted zircon in the residual rock of such a melting event will impart to the residue a characteristic U- or V-shaped REE abundance pattern. In peralkaline, felsic magmas such as those that form pantellerites and comendites, extreme Zr (and REE, Ta) enrichment is possible because the feldspar fractionation that produces these magmas from non-peralkaline predecessors does not drive the melt toward saturation in zircon. Zircon solubility in felsic melts appears to be controlled by the formation of alkali-zirconosilicate complexes of simple (2:1) alkali oxide: ZrO2 stoichiometry.},

abstract = {The Chicoutimi Gneiss Complex was previously considered to host the huge 1160–1140 Ma Lac St. Jean anorthosite suite (20,000 km2), the 1082 ± 3 Ma Chicoutimi Mangerite, and the 1067 ± 3 Ma La Baie Granite. New geological mapping and geochronological data from the Chicoutimi Gneiss Complex now demonstrate clear correlations among some gneissic units and the partially deformed Chicoutimi Man-gerite and La Baie Granite. The remaining gneissic units in the Chicoutimi Gneiss Complex have been grouped into six new lithodems. The three oldest were generated during two distinct events. The Saguenay Gneiss Complex, which is one of these lith-odems and includes the Cap de la Mer Amphibolite unit dated at 1506 ± 13 Ma, is related to a widespread Pinwarian event. It was followed, 100 Ma later, by the 1391 +7/−8 Ma Cap {\`{a}} l'Est Gneiss Complex and the 1383 ± 16 Ma Cyriac Rapakivi Granite. Two younger lithodems are the 1155–1135 Ma K{\'{e}}nogami Charnockite and the 1150 ± 3 Ma Baie {\`{a}} Cadie Mafic-Ultramafic Suite, which are genetically related to the Lac St. Jean Anorthosite Suite. Finally, the 1045 ± 5 Ma Simoncouche Gabbro is the youngest Grenvillian igneous unit dated so far in the Saguenay region. The Lac St. Jean Anorthosite Suite, the Chicoutimi Mangerite, the La Baie Granite, and their host rocks (the Saguenay Gneiss Complex, the Cap {\`{a}} l'Est Gneiss Complex, and the Cyriac Rapakivi Granite) are everywhere in tectonic contact with each other. These contacts are part of the St. Fulgence shear zone, which is over 400 km long and several kilometers wide. Since the Simoncouche Gabbro outcrops within the St. Fulgence shear zone and is weakly deformed, it can be concluded that 1045 ± 5 Ma marked the end of the final movement along the St. Fulgence shear zone in the Saguenay region.},

abstract = {The 1{\textperiodcentered}275 Ga Motzfeldt intrusive complex in the Gardar failed-rift Province in South Greenland formed from six successively intruding melt batches (SM1–SM6) interpreted to be derived from a common magma source at depth. Five units (SM1–SM5) crystallized an alkaline to peralkaline, miaskitic mineral assemblage of amphibole, clinopyroxene, feldspar, nepheline, Fe–Ti oxides, zircon, apatite, fluorite and rarely olivine. The last magmatic batch (SM6) is characterized by an agpaitic mineral assemblage of aegirine, nepheline, alkali-feldspar, eudialyte and rare fluorite or sodalite. Coexisting mafic minerals constrain the crystallization conditions of the miaskitic rocks to about 850–600°C, whereas solidus temperatures below 500°C are indicated by coexisting alkali feldspars in the agpaitic rocks. Oxygen fugacities during the orthomagmatic stage are below the FMQ (fayalite–magnetite–quartz) buffer ($\Delta$FMQ –0{\textperiodcentered}5 to –2{\textperiodcentered}0) whereas late hematite provides evidence of a higher relative oxygen fugacity during late-stage alteration. The Nd and oxygen isotope compositions of amphiboles and pyroxenes are homogeneous throughout the complex and suggest a common, mantle-derived magma source for all six units which is comparable with other Gardar intrusions. The hydrogen isotopic composition of amphiboles ($\delta$D–99 to –132‰) indicates low-temperature fluid–rock interaction with low fluid–rock ratios. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that H2O–NaCl fluids present during the magmatic stages in the miaskitic units had salinities of {\textless}10 wt {\%} NaCl eq. Calcite crystals in fluid inclusions within these rocks suggest that CO2 or HCO3– was an important component of the original fluid phase. In contrast, the agpaitic unit is characterized by a CH4–H2O–NaCl fluid. The C–O–H isotope compositions of the fluid inclusions in all units are consistent with mixing between a small volume of magmatic fluid and a large volume of meteoric water. The chemical evolution of the Motzfeldt complex is a type example of the connection of the transition from miaskitic to agpaitic mineral assemblages with redox-dependent fluid–solid equilibria. The transition from a relatively oxidized to a relatively reduced fluid is correlated with a change from a more reduced, Fe2+-bearing miaskitic (taramite–arfvedsonite, zircon, SM1–SM5) to a more oxidized, Fe3+-bearing agpaitic assemblage (aegirine, eudialyte, SM6). We suggest that coupled fluid–solid redox equilibria involving Fe2+, Fe3+, CO2 and CH4 in this case were simply driven by temperature decrease and an overall increase in Na (+ K) in the melt. This observation sheds light on the heavily debated miaskite–agpaite transition. The combined temperature and compositional effect stabilized Fe3+, CH4 and enhanced the solubility of Zr (possibly as Na–Zr–Si–O complexes) in the latest stage melt (SM6) resulting in the crystallization of an agpaitic mineral assemblage. In terms of redox conditions during crystallization, the Motzfeldt rocks represent an intermediate case in the Gardar Province between more oxidized, CO2-dominated intrusions such as the syenite–carbonatite complex of Gr{\o}nnedal-Ika and CH4-dominated, more reduced complexes such as the peralkaline granitic Puklen and the agpaitic Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex.},

abstract = {We experimentally investigated the phase relations of a peralkaline phonolitic dyke rock associated with the Il{\'{i}}maussaq plutonic complex (South Greenland). The extremely evolved and iron-rich composition (magnesium number = 2, alkalinity index = 1.44, FeO* = 12 wt{\%}) may represent the parental magma of the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex. This dyke rock is therefore perfectly suited for performing phase-equilibrium experiments, since in contrast to the plutonic rocks of the complex, no major cumulate formation processes complicate defining a reasonable starting composition. Experiments were carried out in hydrothermal rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels at P = 100 MPa and T = 950–750 °C. H2O contents ranging from anhydrous to H2O saturated ({\~{}}5 wt{\%} H2O) and varying fO2 ({\~{}}$\Delta$logFMQ −3 to +1; where FMQ represents the fayalite–magnetite–quartz oxygen buffer) were applied. Reduced and dry conditions lead to substantial crystallization of alkali feldspar, nepheline, hedenbergite-rich clinopyroxene, fayalite-rich olivine and minor amounts of ulv{\o}spinel-rich magnetite, which represent the phenocryst assemblage of the natural dyke rock. Oxidized and H2O-rich conditions, however, suppress the crystallization of olivine in favor of magnetite and clinopyroxene with less or no alkali feldspar and nepheline formation. Accordingly, combined low fO2 and aH2O force the evolution of the residual melt toward decreasing SiO2, increasing FeO* and alkalinity index (up to 3.55). On the contrary, high fO2 and aH2O produce residual melts with relatively low FeO*, high SiO2 and a relatively constant alkalinity index. We show that variations of aH2O and fO2 lead to contrasting trends regarding the liquid lines of descent of iron-rich silica-undersaturated peralkaline compositions. Moreover, the increase in FeO* and alkalinity index (reduced and dry conditions) in the residual melt is an important prerequisite to stabilize late-magmatic minerals of the dyke rock, for example, aenigmatite (Na2Fe5TiSi6O20), coexisting with the most evolved melts at 750 °C. Contrary to what might be expected, experiments with high aH2O and interlinked high fO2 exhibit higher liquidus T's compared with experiments performed at low aH2O and fO2 for experiments where magnetite is liquidus phase. This is because ulv{\o}spinel-poor magnetite crystallizes at higher fO2 and has a higher melting point than ulv{\o}spinel-rich magnetite, which is favored at lower fO2.},

abstract = {We have conducted a barometric study of basaltic lavas and mafic to ultramafic xenoliths from Cumbre Vieja volcano (La Palma) in order to reconstruct magma storage, plumbing and related intrusive island growth. The samples were collected both along the volcano's rift zone and from its subaerial and submarine flanks up to 30 km off the rift axis. Clinopyroxene-melt barometry of lavas yields a well-defined pressure range of 410-770 MPa (average 600 MPa) and shows no systematic variation with sample locality. This pressure range reflects a major fractionation level at ca. 15-26 km depth, within the uppermost mantle, where phenocrysts and melt last equilibrated. In contrast, microthermometry of CO2-dominated fluid inclusions in phenocrysts and xenoliths gives pressure estimates of 240 to 470 MPa (average 330 MPa), within the lower oceanic crust. These pressures are interpreted to reflect an underplating zone at 7-14 km depth where ascending magmas become ponded prior to eruption and where passing magmas temporarily stagnate during eruption. The underplating zone is inferred to extend to a radius of ca. 30 km at least, and its depth appears to increase slightly with distance to the rift axis. Our data thus show a remarkable pressure bimodality for long-term and short-term storage of magma that appears to be characteristic for Cumbre Vieja. By using a simple model based on the cumulative volume of material added to the crust, we have estimated uplift rates of {\textgreater} 0.5 m/ka due to underplating that occurs on the island scale. On a time-scale of some 10 ka, these uplift rates are of similar magnitude as global changes in sea-level. A second, more local mode of uplift and related faulting is caused by shallow intrusions into the volcanic edifice as is indicated by the highly irregular morphology of the Cumbre Vieja. We stress that intrusion-related uplift should be qualitatively considered when reconstructing the evolution of oceanic island volcanoes. Since most of the underplated material is inferred to consist of cumulate rocks being intimately mixed and juxtaposed with the lower oceanic crust and having similar densities, it is probably impossible to detect such an underplating zone seismically. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isochrons based on whole rock amphibolite and leucoamphibolite samples yield ages of 2990 ± 41. Ma and 3020 ± 78. Ma, respectively, which are within error of the age of the Fisken{\ae}sset Complex situated 5-25. km to the north. Leucoamphibolites from the three supracrustal belts show apparent geochemical mixing trends between tholeiitic amphibolites and TTG gneisses, as the end-members. By assimilation-fractional-crystallisation (AFC) modelling we can show that one group of leucoamphibolites can indeed be explained by contamination of the parental melts by a TTG-like end-member and another group of high P2O5, La and Nb leucoamphibolites can be explained by contamination involving a hypothetical low-silica adakite end-member. However, the leucoamphibolites are juvenile with e{\{}open{\}}Nd(2970Ma)from +2.1 to +3.5 and e{\{}open{\}}Hf(2970Ma)of +3.5 to +4.3. Thus, the mafic source of the felsic contaminant melts must have been derived from a depleted mantle source more or less at the same time ({\textless}60Ma) as the volcanism took place. Our preferred interpretation of the geochemical and isotope data is that the protoliths of the supracrustal rocks formed in an island arc setting, where early tholeiitic volcanism gave way to calc-alkaline volcanism in a maturing arc. The apparent AFC trends are thus explained by in situ partial melting of basaltic arc crust to form juvenile TTG- and adakite-melts that mixed with mafic magmas or contaminated their mantle source to produce the calc-alkaline leucoamphibolite protolith. This model has important implications for the general interpretation of other Archaean supracrustal belts, because AFC and geochemical mixing trends towards a TTG end-member are not uniquely diagnostic of crustal contamination, but may rather reflect processes operating at lower crustal or source levels in arcs, such as melting-assimilation-storage-homogenisation (MASH) or slab-melt (low-silica adakite) metasomatism of the mantle source, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kirkpatrick2013,
abstract = {The major platinum-group elements (PGE) concentrations in layered intrusions are typically associated with zones in which the sulfide abundance begins to increase. In a number of layered intrusions, there is also a distinct stratigraphic separation in the peak concentrations of the PGE from those of the base metals, gold and sulfur through these zones. These stratigraphic “offsets” are characterized by a lower, typically S-poor, Pt- and Pd-enriched zone overlain by a zone enriched in the base metals, S and Au. The separations amount to a few decimeters to several tens of meters. In some instances, the high Pt and Pd concentrations are associated with trivial amounts of sulfide. Theoretical considerations suggest that these offsets can be modeled as chromatographic peaks that develop during an infiltration/reaction process. Using Pd as a typical PGE and Cu as a typical base metal, a numeric model is developed that illustrates how metal separations can develop in a vapor-refining zone as fluid evolved during solidification of a cumulus pile leaches sulfide and redeposits it higher in the crystal pile. The solidification/degassing ore-element transport is coupled with a compaction model for the crystal pile. Solidification resulting from conductive cooling through the base of the compacting column leads to an increasing volatile concentration in the intercumulus liquid until it reaches fluid saturation. Separation and upward migration of this fluid lead to an upward-migrating zone of increasingly higher bulk water contents as water degassed from underlying cumulates enriches overlying, fluid-undersaturated interstitial liquids. Sulfide is resorbed from the degassing regions and is reprecipitated in these vapor-undersaturated interstitial liquids, producing a zone of relatively high modal sulfide that also migrates upward with time. Owing to its strong preference for sulfide, Pd is not significantly mobile until all sulfide is resorbed. The result is a zone of increasing PGE enrichment that follows the sulfide resorption front as solidification/degassing continues. In detail, the highest Pd concentrations occur stratigraphically below the peak in S and base metals. The high Pd/S ratio mimics values conventionally interpreted as the result of high (silicate liquid)/(sulfide liquid) mass ratios (“R” values). However, in this case, the high Pd/S ratio is the result of a chromatographic/reaction front enrichment and not a magmatic sulfide-saturation event.},

abstract = {The exposed crust consists mainly of plagioclase (35{\%}), quartz (20{\%}), K-feldspar (11{\%}), volcanic glass (12{\%}), biotite (8{\%}), and muscovite (5{\%}). Quartz is a resistate, thus feldspars and glass represent approximately 75 percent of the labile minerals. The weathering characteristics of these constituents are summarized in the context of thermodynamic, mass balance and kinetic considerations. Experimentally determined release rate constants were used to predict the proportions of Ca, Na and K released by feldspars of plutonic rocks (granites to gabbros) to weathering solutions. The chemical weathering trends of the weathered residues, calculated from the kinetic data, conform closely to the initial trends observed in some recent weathering profiles, demonstrating the accuracy of the predictions. Since the weathering of feldspars is controlled by processes that should not change through geological time, the relative release rates of Ca, Na, and K from the feldspars of granitic rocks can be calculated for future and past episodes of continental weathering. Experimentally determined release rate constants are not available for a wide range of volcanic glass compositions, but the limited data indicate that compositional trends are predictable in weathering profiles developed on volcanic rocks. The kinetic data available for rhyolitic glasses accurately predict the initial weathering trends observed in a recent rhyolite weathering profile. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

@article{Manning1981Fluor,
abstract = {Liquidus phase relationships have been determined experimentally for the system Qz-Ab-Or with excess water and 1, 2, and 4 wt.{\%} added fluorine at 1 kb pressure. With increasing fluorine content the position of the quartz-alkali feldspar field boundary moves away from the quartz apex. The position of the minimum melting composition and the minimum liquidus temperature change progressively from Qz37Ab34Or29 and 730° C for the fluorine free system (Tuttle and Bowen 1958) to Qz15Ab58Or27 and 630° C for the system with 4 wt.{\%} added fluorine. Exploratory experiments have been carried out below the liquidus, and have indicated that for certain bulk compositions an assemblage consisting of two alkali feldspars, quartz, melt and vapour can exist at temperatures as low as 550° C at 1 kb. The experimental results suggest that there may be an interaction between fluorine and aluminosilicate complexes present within the melt, to produce aluminofluoride (AlF 6 3− ) complex anions (Manning et al. 1980). The observed changes in liquidus phase relationships with increasing fluorine content indicate that the compositions of certain fluorine-rich granitic rocks are consistent with an origin by crystallisation of residual melts enriched in fluorine by magmatic differentiation. Such residual melts may exist at relatively low temperatures, and may form part of a continuum between granite magmatism and associated hydrothermal activity. Because of the observed preference of fluorine for aluminosilicate phases at the magmatic stage, the presence of fluorine alone is not considered to play a direct part in the generation of residual mineralising hydrothermal fluids.},

Olivine is the liquidus phase up to 30 kb for all water contents studied except for anhydrous (clinopyroxene on the liquidus) and 15{\%} H2O (phlogopite on the liquidus) conditions. Analyses of phases crystallizing from the biotite mafurite show that pressure has very little effect on the composition of clinopyroxene which is extremely calcium-rich, and low in Al2O3 and TiO2 for all conditions investigated. Phlogopite has low TiO2 content and titanphlogopite cannot be a refractory phase in the upper mantle causing Ti-depletion in partial melts in equilibrium with titanphlogopite. There are apparently no conditions where the extremely potassic biotite mafurite could be a partial melt from pyrolite but derivation from an olivine+clinopyroxene+phlogopite+ilmenite assemblage occurring as ‘enriched' patches in the upper mantle, is possible. Liquids in equilibrium with phlogopite as a residual phase at ∼30 kb would be olivine nephelinites with approximately 5{\%} K2O, Na2O/K2O ≽ 1 and TiO2 {\textgreater} 5+. Crystal elutriation with transported residual phlogopite reacting (phlogopite+liquid 1 ⇌ olivine+liquid 2) at lower pressures provides a mechanism for K-enrichment and generating Na2O/K2O {\textless} 1.},

abstract = {Lower crustal earthquakes are commonly observed in continental rifts at depths where temperatures should be too high for brittle failure to occur. Here we present accurately located earthquakes in central Ethiopia, covering an incipient oceanic plate boundary in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Seismicity is evaluated using the combination of exceptionally well resolved seismic structure of the crust and upper mantle, electromagnetic properties of the crust, rock geochemistry, and geological data. The combined data sets provide evidence that lower crustal earthquakes are focused in mafic lower crust containing pockets of the largest fraction of partial melt. The pattern of seismicity and distribution of crustal melt also correlates closely with presence of partial melt in the upper mantle, suggesting lower crustal earthquakes are induced by ongoing crustal modification through magma emplacement that is driven by partial melting of the mantle. Our results show that magmatic processes control not only the distribution of shallow seismicity and volcanic activity along the axis of the rift valley but also anomalous earthquakes in the lower crust away from these zones of localized strain.},

abstract = {Investigations of a variety of continental rifts and margins worldwide have revealed that a considerable volume of melt can intrude into the crust during continental breakup, modifying its composition and thermal structure. However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning. Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin.},

abstract = {There is little concensus on the relative importance of crystal fractionation and differential partial melting to the chemical diversity observed within most types of volcanic suites. A resolution to this controversy is best sought in suites contain- ing high MgO lavas such as the Chukotat volcanics of the Proter- ozoic Cape Smith foldbelt, Ungava, Quebec. The succession of this volcanic suite consists of repetitive sequences, each beginning with olivine-phyric basalt (19-12 wt{\%} MgO), grading upwards to pyroxene-phyric basalt (12-8 wt{\%} MgO) and then, in later sequences, to plagioclase-phyric basalt (7-4 wt{\%} MgO). Only the olivine-phyric basatts have compositions capable of equili- brating with the upper mantle and are believed to represent parental magmas for the suite. The pyroxene-phyric and plagio- clase-phyric basalts represent magmas derived from these parents by the crystal fractionation of olivine, with minor chromite, clinopyroxene and plagioclase. The order of extrusion in each volcanic sequence is interpreted to reflect a density effect in which successively lighter, more evolved magmas are erupted as hydrostatic pressure wanes. The pyroxene-phyric basalts ap- pear to have evolved at high levels in the active part of the conduit system as the eruption of their parents was in progress. The plagioclase-phyric basalts may represent residual liquids ex- pelled from isolated reservoirs along the crust-mantle interface during the late stages of volcanic activity. A positive correlation between FeO and MgO in the early, most basic olivine-phyric basalts is interpreted to reflect progres- sive adiabatic partial melting in the upper mantle. Although this complicates the chemistry, it is not a significant factor in the compositional diversification of the volcanic suite. The pres- ervation of such compositional melting effects, however, suggests that the most basic olivine-phyric basalts represent primitive mag- mas. The trace element characteristics of these magmas, and their derivatives, indicate that the mantle source for the Chukotat volcanics had experienced a previous melting event.},

abstract = {Chemical variation in biotite from the KJokken gabbro-syenite intrusion in the Proterozoic Gardar province in South Greenland has been investigated by electron probe and, for F and Li, ion microprobe. Most mica occurs in small amounts as fringes on ilmenomagnetite or fayalite, rarely as an intercumulus or poikilitic phase. The micas range continuously from Phlog70Ann30 in a gabbro, to Phlog4Ann96 in the most evolved (slightly persilicic and peralkaline) syenite. In the syenites Fe-Mg partitioning between biotite and olivine can be described by a single distribution coefficient, Kd = XF XBiotMs/XBiotFe ∼3, suggesting that these reactant phases mix ideally at the reaction T. Experimental data for Fe-Mg exchange via aqueous chloride solutions (Schulien, 1980) imply low T (∼32Q°C). F was absent in the experiments and may significantly affect the exchange equilibrium. Kd in the gabbros is ∼ 1, consistent with equilibrium via a fluid depleted in F because of crystallization of large amounts of amphibole.Al, Mn, and Ti vary regularly throughout the series and can be used as markers of cryptic variation in the layered syenites. (Al + Si): 22 O is always in the range 7.7–7.85. A1/(A1 + Si) decreases from ∼0.31 in gabbros to 0.25 in the most Fe-rich micas. Li is always {\textless} 260 ppm w. In the syenite series, F shows a near-linear inverse relationship with Fe/(Fe + Mg) which passes close to OF at Ann100 with ∼l.4 wt{\%} F(0–7 F to 44 positive charges) at Ann44. Biotites in the gabbro unit (which forms an outer sheath to the intrusion) have relatively less F, probably because it was consumed by coexisting amphibole. $\delta$I8O is similar for both gabbros and syenites, and it is unlikely that an envelope fluid was involved in the reactions. G reaches a maximum of 0.3 wt. {\%} in biotite except for that in one syenite sample with 0–7 wt. {\%}. Calculation of relative F-OH fugacities from the reaction OH-phlogopite + F-annite = F-phlogopite + OH-annite, as calibrated by Munoz (1984), appears to suggest that each horizon in the layered series was in equilibrium with a slightly different fluid. In view of the intimate interleaving of these lithologies, this is improbable. The equilibrium constant of the exchange reaction, obtained from the experimental data, seems not to be appropriate to the Klokken assemblage, or to other examples of regular F-Fe avoidance. Explanations may include short-range Fe-Mg ordering in the natural examples or the effect of additional components in the fluid. F contents are high in comparison with biotites from calc-alkaline complexes; high magmatic F may account for the igneous layering common in the Gardar. Temperatures calculated from reactions involving fayalite and magnetite show that most biotites grew subsolidus. The F-poor annites grew {\textgreater} 300 °C subsolidus even when texturally intercumulus. Stable isotope data are consistent with the separation and retention of a deuteric fluid during the final stage of magmatic crystallization. Klokken was not generally subject to the pervasive, long-range (in both distance and time) dydrothermal interactions demonstrated in calcalkaline and theleiitic intrusions, although more extensive fluid flow is indicated for the more permeable laminated syenites. The biotites preserve chemical variation indicating local equilibrium with other mafic phases, and halogens provide a useful marker of subsolidus fluid flow.},

abstract = {SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dates, combined with in-situ Hf isotopic data, provide new constraints on the petrogenesis and protolith of peralkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous intrusions and rhyolitic tuffs in the Emeishan large igneous province, with significant bearing on crustal melting associated with mantle plumes. Syenite and A-type granitic intrusions from Huili, Miyi and Taihe in the center of this large igneous province yield U-Pb dates at ∼260 Ma, consistent with the ages obtained for mafic layered intrusions in the same province. Zircon from these rocks exhibits a wide range of initial Hf isotope ratios ($\epsilon$Hf(t) = -1.4 to +13.4), with corresponding TDM1 of 400-900 Ma. The highest $\epsilon$Hf(t) value is only marginally lower than that of depleted mantle reservoir at 260 Ma, suggesting that their source is primarily juvenile crust added during Emeishan volcanism, with incorporation of variable amounts of Neoproterozoic crust. The trigger of crustal melting is most likely related to advective heating associated with magmatic underplating. In contrast, the 255-251 Ma peraluminous granites from Ailanghe and 238 Ma rhyolitic tuff from Binchuan, have negative initial $\epsilon$Hf values of -1.3 to -4.4, and of -7.7 to -14, respectively. Hf isotopic model ages and presence of inherited zircons indicate their derivation from Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic crust, respectively. Given the time lag relative to the plume impact (∼260 Ma) and insignificant mantle contribution to 255-238 Ma magmatism, conductive heating is suggested as the trigger of crustal melting that resulted in formation of delayed felsic magmas. The involvement of older crust in younger felsic magmas is consistent with upward heat transfer to the lithosphere during plume impregnation, if the age of crust is inversely stratified, i.e., changes from Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic to Permian with increasing depth. Such crust may have resulted from episodic, downward crustal growth during the evolution of the western Yangtze Craton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Olivine-hosted melt inclusions from four eruptions at Hekla volcano in Iceland were analyzed for their dissolved H2O, CO2, S, and Cl contents. A positive correlation among the repose interval, magmatic evolution, and volatile contents of magmas is revealed. H2O is the dominant volatile species; it behaves as an incompatible component, increasing in concentration over time as a result of fractional crystallization in the magma. The full suite of H2O contents ranges from a low of 0.80 wt {\%} in basaltic andesites to a maximum of 5.67 wt {\%} in rhyolites. Decreasing H2O/K2O at fixed major element compositions suggests that syneruptive degassing reduces H2O contents significantly. Hekla magmas are CO2 poor, with very low concentrations present only in the most evolved compositions (∼20–30 ppm or less). The decrease in S content from basaltic andesite to rhyolite demonstrates that sulfide saturation is attained when the melt composition reaches basaltic andesite, resulting in the precipitation of pyrrhotite. Low CO2/Nb ratios suggest that vapor saturation is most likely reached during an early period of cooling and solidification in the crust. Fresh injections of mafic magma interact with previously solidified intrusives, producing new melts that are volatile undersaturated. Vapor saturation pressures obtained using the most volatile-rich melt inclusions suggest the presence of a magma chamber at a minimum depth of ∼7 km. This is in agreement with geophysical observations from recent small-volume eruptions, but given the possibility of volatile-undersaturated melts, some of the magmas may reside at greater depths.},

In19F MAS NMR spectra of the fluorine-bearing peralkaline glasses at least five F sites could be distinguished, while only three of these sites could be found in the corresponding peraluminous glasses, which shows that there are more F incorporation mechanisms in peralkaline than in peraluminous glasses. In the peralkaline glasses containing up to 6.2mol{\%} F the following F environments were identified: F-Ca(n) at {\~{}}-113ppm, Si-F-Na(n) or Al-F-Ca(n) at {\~{}}-146ppm, Al-F-Al at {\~{}}-168ppm, Al-F-Na(n) at {\~{}}-188ppm and F-Na(n) at {\~{}}-225ppm ("n" indicates that the number of atoms is variable or uncertain). F-Ca(n) is the most abundant site which is surprising as Ca is the least common cation in the glasses. The fraction of F-Ca(n) sites increases from 42{\%} to 53{\%} as the F content increases from 1.2 to 6.2mol{\%}. The addition of up to 16.5mol{\%} (5.3wt{\%}) water strongly affects F speciation in peralkaline glasses and results in a decrease in the fraction of F-Al sites compared to F-Ca(n) sites. It seems that hydroxyl groups (OH) and F occupy similar Al environments and that F cannot compete with OH.In the peraluminous glasses containing up to 18.3. mol{\%} F only three F environments Si-F-Na(n) or Al-F-Ca(n) at {\~{}}-149. ppm, Al-F-Al at {\~{}}-170. ppm and Al-F-Na(n) at {\~{}}-190. ppm are observed.

abstract = {Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica, is an active, intraplate, alkaline volcano. The strongly undersaturated sodic lavas range from basanite to anorthoclase phonolite, and are termed the Erebus lineage (EL). The lavas are porphyritic with olivine (Fo88–51), clinopyroxene (Wo45–53En36–41Fs8–30), opaque oxides (Usp31–76), feldspar (An72–11), and apatite. Rare earth element (REE) contents increase only slightly with increasing differentiation compared with other incompatible elements. The light REE are enriched (LaN/YbN= 14–20) and there are no significant Eu anomalies. 87Sr/86Sr is uniform and low (˜ 0.7030) throughout the EL, suggesting derivation of the basanites from a depleted asthenospheric mantle source, and lack of significant crustal contamination during fractionation of the basanite. Regular geochemical trends indicate that the EL evolved from the basanites by fractional crystallization. Major element mass balance calculations and trace element models show that fractionation of 16{\%} olivine, 52{\%} clinopyroxene, 14{\%} Fe-Ti oxides, 11{\%} feldspar, 3{\%} nepheline, and 3{\%} apatite from a basanite parent leaves 23.5{\%} anorthoclase phonolite.Minor volumes of less undersaturated, more iron-rich benmoreite, phonolite, and trachyte are termed the enriched iron series (EFS). The trachytes have 87Sr/86Sr of 0.704, higher than other EFS and EL rocks, and they probably evolved by a combined assimilation-fractional crystallization process.The large volume of phonolite at Mt. Erebus requires significant basanite production. This occurs by low degrees of partial melting in a mantle plume (here termed the Erebus plume) rising at a rate of about 6 cm/yr. },

abstract = {Trace element diffusion was experimentally investigated in nominally dry (0.03-0.10 wt.{\%} H2O) and hydrous (1.13-1.86 wt.{\%} H2O) melts of trachytic and phonolitic composition at temperatures from 1050 to 1250 °C and a pressure of 500 MPa. Experiments with a large set of trace elements (Rb, Sr, Ba, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Sn) were performed in an internally heated gas pressure vessel using the diffusion triple technique. In doing so, two diffusion couples are combined in a single experiment in order to avoid problems in deconvolution of X-ray fluorescence spectra due to peak overlapping. Profiles of all trace elements were simultaneously analyzed by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis ($\mu$-SRXRF). Most of the diffusion profiles can be fitted well assuming constant diffusivity. The diffusion data recorded in a single experiment cover a range of 1.4 log units to 2.9 log units. While the low field strength elements (LFSEs) Rb, Sr and Ba are always the fastest elements, the high field strength elements (HFSEs) Zr, Nb and Hf are the slowest elements. At constant temperature and water content the trace element diffusivities increase with increasing fraction of network modifying cations from rhyolite over trachyte to phonolite. For a given composition the diffusivities of the rare earth elements (REEs) decrease slightly with increasing atomic number except for Eu which diffuses faster than the other REEs. This finding can be explained by a significant fracton of europium being in the divalent state while the other REEs are present only in the trivalent state in silicate melts. The diffusivity of Eu and other redox sensitive cations (Cr, Sn) depends strongly on Fe2+/Fetotalof the melt. At reducing conditions these three elements are accelerated compared to univalent elements. Diffusion of all trace elements is strongly enhanced by dissolved water. In general, the effect is larger for HFSEs than for LFSEs. For instance, at 1150 °C the diffusivity of Zr increases by 1.4 orders of magnitude, but that of Sr only by 0.5 orders of magnitude when adding 1.7 wt.{\%} of H2O to dry phonolite. To test viscosity-diffusivity relationships, we have performed viscosity experiments with the same melt compositions using the falling sphere method. The viscosity of phonolite and trachyte melts can be correlated with the Zr diffusivity by the Eyring relationship when using a jumping distance of 0.503 ± 0.067 nm. The empirical model of Mungall [Mungall, J.E., 2002b. Empirical models relating viscosity and tracer diffusion in magmatic silicate melts. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 66, 125-143.] reproduces the diffusivity data within 0.8 log units for HFSEs and within 0.6 log units for intermediate field strength elements (IFSEs) when using the viscosity data as an input. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Geochemical and isotope results are presented from a new study of the most southern basalts in the Deccan Trap, India. Three chemical formations are recognised, two of which can be correlated with the established stratigraphy in Mahabaleshwar and imply a regional southerly dip of 0.06?? over a distance of 250 km. In detail Sr-isotope variations within the Ambenali and Mahabaleshwar Formations can be shown to reflect three distinct end-members which provide new constraints for petrogenetic models. Pb-isotope data for selected basalts exhibit a wide range with 206Pb204Pb = 16.87-22.45, and a linear correlation on a PbPb diagram. The least contaminated Ambenali basalts plot within the Pb-array, and interaction with mantle lithosphere involves a shift to less radiogenic Pb whereas contamination with crust is characterised by more radiogenic Pb. Unlike the Karoo and Parana continental flood basalt provinces only four flow units within the southern Deccan appear to contain a significant contribution from mantle lithosphere. The Mahabaleshwar and Ambenali Formation basalts exhibit a striking negative PbSr isotope trend which is presently regarded as one of the features of interaction with shallow level lithospheric mantle. It further suggests that basalts from the Walvis Ridge, Kerguelen and Ninetyeast ridge all remobilised such shallow level material, and that the Deccan basalts which were not affected by crustal contamination reflect interaction between asthenospheric material similar to T-type MORB, but related to the Reunion hotspot, and continental mantle lithosphere of the Indian plate. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {The petrology, geochemistry and petrogenesis of the active Teide–Pico Viejo volcanic complex provide information about the evolution and internal structure of the Tenerife central magma system during its most recent volcanic cycle. Two petrologically distinct basaniten–phonolite lineages are identified, which correlate essentially with the products of the Pico Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes. Geochemical modelling supports the evolution of both series from a common evolved basanite parent, by crystal fractionation under different physico-chemical conditions. Pico Viejo series intermediate magmas fractionated mainly kaersutite and low-Or plagioclase at high PH2O, whereas Teide series examples fractionated mainly high–Or plagioclase and clinopyroxene at low PH2O, resulting in lower Ba, Sr, Eu/Eu* and MREE/HREE, and less peralkaline phonolitic residua. The Pico Viejo series shows smooth modal, mineralogical and whole-rock chemical variations, whereas the Teide series shows the additional effects of mineral accumulation, magma mixing, assimilation of hydrothermally altered crust and contamination by felsic magmas. Pyroxene barometry suggests that parental basanites and Pico Viejo series intermediate magmas evolved in the lower crust and uppermost mantle at 6–12 kbar Ptotal. Teide series intermediate magmas experienced polybaric fractionation, also differentiating extensively within a shallow chamber beneath Teide, where low PH2O conditions resulted from low Ptotal and, on the basis of F and Cl systematics, from open–system degassing. Hygrometry and melt-inclusion data from phonolites suggest a shallow Teide chamber at ∼1.5 kbar Ptotal, whereas Pico Viejo series phonolites evolved in a separate shallow chamber at ∼1 kbar Ptotal.},

It contains effusive, intrusive and volcanoclastic rocks varying in compositions from ultramafic to felsic, though low-Ti basalts and their intrusive analogs are the predominant rock types. In this paper, we provide new 40Ar/39Ar ages for two lava units of the geographic center of the Siberian Traps, the Central Putorana region (240.9±1.3/2.6/5.5 and 246.6±1.4/2.7/5.6Ma, where ages are calculated relative to Bern4M with an assigned age of 18.7 (±0.096) Ma and errors are stated in the form ±x/y/z, where x and y and z are analytical, internal and external errors, respectively), three dolerite sills from the Angara-Taseevskaya syncline of the southeastern Siberian Traps (242.8±1.3/2.6/5.0Ma, 239.1±1.1/2.5/4.9Ma and 255.8±4.7/5.3/6.9Ma) and a lamproite dyke from the Noril'sk region (238.3±1.3/2.6/5.3Ma). In combination with available geochronologic data our results suggest that voluminous low-Ti basaltic magmatism appeared during different pulses. At least two volcanic pulses are recognized: at the Permo-Triassic boundary ({\~{}}249Ma or 252Ma using the 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb timescales, respectively) and about 10Ma later in the Middle Triassic. Granitic magmatism overlapped in time with the two flood basalt pulses, but continued into the Late Triassic ({\~{}}229Ma using the U-Pb timescale). Prolonged magmatism of the Siberian Traps province is also supported by geologic observations and paleomagnetic data. New geochronologic findings are discussed in light of the different models for the origin of the Siberian Traps and applied to a Middle Triassic mass extinction event. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The late-collisional Erzgebirge granites ([{\~{}}]325-318 Ma) were emplaced at shallow crustal levels in the Variscan metamorphic basement shortly after large-scale extension caused by orogenic collapse. These granites comprise mildly peraluminous transitional I--S-types and strongly peraluminous S-type rocks, which can be subdivided into three major groups: low-F biotite granites; low-F two-mica granites; and high-F, high-P2O5 Li-mica granites. The highest degree of differentiation is reached in the Li-mica granites, which exhibit strongly elevated concentrations of P, F, Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Sn, W and U; but very low Ti, Mg, Co, Ni, Sr, Ba, Y, Zr, Hf, Th and rare earth elements. Crystal--melt fractionation is the dominant process controlling the bulk composition of all groups of granites. However, metasomatic processes involving late-stage residual melts and high-T orthomagmatic fluids became increasingly more important in highly evolved units and have modified the abundances of mobile elements (P, F, Li, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr) in the Li-mica granites particularly. Isotopic and geochemical characteristics suggest that the three granite groups cannot be derived from a common precursor magma. Their discrete compositions are source related, and are attributed to melting of quartzo-feldspathic and pelitic crustal lithologies in different proportions. Granites are common in the central European Variscides, but the Erzgebirge is unusual for the predominance of evolved Li-mica granites associated with economically important Sn, W and U deposits. The abundance of Li-mica granites is attributed to a combination of favourable factors: (1) low degrees of anatectic melting of crustal protoliths; (2) wide distribution of fertile lithologies rich in large-ion lithophile elements and ore elements; (3) extended magmatic differentiation by crystal--melt fractionation and subsequent autometasomatism.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates glaciovolcanism in the Mount Cayley volcanic field (MCVF) of southwestern British Columbia's Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB). The MCVF is dominated by intermediate magma compositions, has been intermittently glaciated, and has extreme topography. No study to date has focused on intermediate composition glaciovolcanic deposits in a similar setting. The core of this thesis is a 1:20,000 volcanological map, which was used in conjunction with field observations, geochemical data, and petrographic examinations to investigate the volcanological history of the MCVF, to investigate the eruptive processes that produce specific glaciovolcanic landforms, and to make predictions about paleo-ice thicknesses and distributions. The MCVF (and the entire GVB) has three dominant intermediate composition glaciovolcanic landform types: subglacial domes, flow-dominated tuyas, and impoundment features. Subglacial domes are irregularly-shaped piles of lava flows representing subglacial eruptions that commenced beneath 100-650 m of ice and did not breach the surface; in many cases, the subglacial domes grew to within 150 m of the ice surface. Flow-dominated tuyas are steep-sided, flat-topped stacks of lava flows representing subglacial eruptions that ultimately breached the ice surface. Subglacial domes and flow-dominated tuyas represent the same eruptive process, the primary difference being whether or not the ice was breached. Impoundment features are subaerial lava flows with steep flanks or termini representing channeling or ponding of lava by ice. All three landforms have intense fine-scale jointing that indicates cooling surfaces inconsistent with apparent paleotopography. Additionally, all lack features recording eruption into water (pillows and hyaloclastite), indicating efficient and continuous meltwater drainage during eruptions. This is different from glaciovolcanic deposits in most other settings. It also makes these deposits distinct from basaltic glaciovolcanic deposits in the GVB. A combination of ice geometry, topography, and magma composition is responsible; thin ice promotes the formation of drainage pathways around subglacial vents, while thin ice coupled with steep bedrock topography creates hydraulic gradients away from vents. Magma composition probably also plays a role, due to its effect on quantities of ice melted and the pressure in subglacial vent cavities and drainage conduits.},

abstract = {Partition coefficients (zircon/meltDM) for rare earth elements (REE) (La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Dy, Er and Yb) and other trace elements (Ba, Rb, B, Sr, Ti, Y and Nb) between zircon and melt have been calculated from secondary ion mass spectrometric (SIMS) analyses of zircon/melt inclusion pairs. The melt inclusion-mineral (MIM) technique shows that DREE increase in compatibility with increasing atomic number, similar to results of previous studies. However, DREE determined using the MIM technique are, in general, lower than previously reported values. Calculated DREE indicate that light REE with atomic numbers less than Sm are incompatible in zircon and become more incompatible with decreasing atomic number. This behavior is in contrast to most previously published results which indicate D {\textgreater} 1 and define a flat partitioning pattern for elements from La through Sm. The partition coefficients for the heavy REE determined using the MIM technique are lower than previously published results by factors of ≈15 to 20 but follow a similar trend. These differences are thought to reflect the effects of mineral and/or glass contaminants in samples from earlier studies which employed bulk analysis techniques.

DREE determined using the MIM technique agree well with values predicted using the equations of Brice (1975), which are based on the size and elasticity of crystallographic sites. The presence of Ce4+ in the melt results in elevated DCe compared to neighboring REE due to the similar valence and size of Ce4+ and Zr4+. Predicted zircon/meltD values for Ce4+ and Ce3+ indicate that the Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios of the melt ranged from about 10−3 to 10−2. Partition coefficients for other trace elements determined in this study increase in compatibility in the order Ba {\textless} Rb {\textless} B {\textless} Sr {\textless} Ti {\textless} Y {\textless} Nb, with Ba, Rb, B and Sr showing incompatible behavior (DM {\textless} 1.0), and Ti, Y and Nb showing compatible behavior (DM {\textgreater} 1.0).

The effect of partition coefficients on melt evolution during petrogenetic modeling was examined using partition coefficients determined in this study and compared to trends obtained using published partition coefficients. The lower DREE determined in this study result in smaller REE bulk distribution coefficients, for a given mineral assemblage, compared to those calculated using previously reported values. As an example, fractional crystallization of an assemblage composed of 35{\%} hornblende, 64.5{\%} plagioclase and 0.5{\%} zircon produces a melt that becomes increasingly more enriched in Yb using the DYb from this study. Using DYb from Fujimaki (1986) results in a melt that becomes progressively depleted in Yb during crystallization.},

abstract = {The rift-related magmas of the Proterozoic Gardar Igneous Province were emplaced across the contact between the South Greenland Archaean craton and the Palaeoproterozoic Ketilidian mobile belt. It has been suggested that the geochemistry of Gardar intrusive rocks in the two areas varies across the craton margin and that this reflects a lithospheric control. However, comparison of the geochemical and isotopic signatures of basic and ultrabasic dykes from across the area shows that there is no systematic variation related to the age of the country rock. All the Gardar basic rocks are inferred to have been derived from the mantle, with relatively little crustal contamination. We suggest that the lithospheric mantle beneath the Gardar Province was enriched by slab-derived fluids during the Ketilidian orogeny (c. 1800 Ma). Subsequent melting of this mantle source was promoted during Gardar rifting when volatile-rich, small-degree melts from the asthenosphere were introduced into the lithospheric mantle, forming enriched metasomites. Ultrabasic lamprophyre dykes in the Gardar Province represent melts derived largely from these metasomites, whereas basaltic magmas were formed by larger-scale melting of the lithospheric mantle, inheriting a subduction-related signature. There is no evidence that the Gardar magmas were derived from a highly enriched lithospheric keel that had existed since craton formation.},

abstract = {The occurrence of subduction zone earthquakes is primarily controlled by the state of stress on the interface between the subducting and overriding plates. This stress state is influenced by tectonic properties, such as the age of the subducting plate and the rate of plate motion. It is difficult to directly measure stress on a plate interface. However, the stress state can be inferred using the Gutenberg–Richter relationship's b-value, which characterizes the relative number of small compared to large earthquakes and correlates negatively with differential stress. That is, a subduction zone characterized by relatively frequent large earthquakes has a low b-value and a high stress state. The b-value for subduction zones worldwide varies significantly, but the source of this variance is unclear. Here we use the Advanced National Seismic System earthquake catalogue to estimate b-values for 88 sections in different subduction zones globally and compare the b-values with the age of the subducting plate and plate motions. The b-value correlates positively with subducting plate age, so that large earthquakes occur more frequently in subduction zones with younger slabs, but there is no correlation between b-value and plate motion. Given that younger slabs are warmer and more buoyant, we suggest that slab buoyancy is the primary control on the stress state and earthquake size distribution in subduction zones.},

abstract = {The Rogart igneous complex is unique within the northern Scottish Caledonides because it comprises an apparent continuum of magma types that records a progressive change in emplacement mechanisms related to large-scale tectonic controls. Syn-D-2 leucogranites and late-D-2 quartz monzodiorites were emplaced during crustal thickening and focused within the broad zone of ductile deformation associated with the Naver Thrust. In contrast, emplacement of the post-D-2 composite central pluton was controlled by development of a steeply dipping dextral shear zone along the Loch Shin Line, interpreted as an anti-Riedel shear within the Great Glen Fault system. The mantle-derived nature of the late-to-post-D-2 melts implies that the Naver Thrust and the Loch Shin Line were both crustal-scale structures along which magmas were channelled during deformation. A U-Pb zircon age of 425 +/- 1.5 Ma for the outer component of the central pluton provides an upper limit on regional deformation and metamorphism within host Moine rocks. These findings are consistent with the view that a fundamental change in tectonic regime occurred in the Scottish Caledonides at c. 425 Ma, corresponding to the switch from regional thrusting that resulted from the collision of Baltica and Laurentia, to the development of the orogen-parallel Great Glen Fault system.},

abstract = {REE distribution coefficients were measured between synthetic pyroxenes and melts similar in composition to the inferred Shergotty intercumulus liquid, by in situ analysis with the electron microprobe, using samples doped to per cent concentration levels. These coefficients exhibit a strong positive correlation with pyroxene wollastonite content. Recommended values for augites similar in composition to the Shergotty cumulus augite cores (Wo32En48) are D(La) = 0.023, D(Ce) = 0.039, D(Nd) = 0.10, D(Sm) = 0.17, D(Eu) = 0.16, D(Gd) = 0.20, D(Yb) = 0.29, and D(Lu) = 0.30. Recommended values for pigeonites similar in composition to the Shergotty cumulus pigeonite cores (Wo12En58) are D(La) = 0.002, D(Ce) = 0.004, D(Nd) = 0.019, D(Sm) = 0.031, D(Yb) = 0.13, and D(Lu) = 0.13. These values resemble distribution coefficients measured for terrestrial basalts of higher Mg Fe than the Shergotty melt, rather than those of more evolved siliceous rocks of similar Mg Fe to the Shergotty melt. Thus it appears that Mg Fe is considerably less important than other factors in determining distribution coefficient values for pyroxenes. REE abundances were computed for the Shergotty intercumulus melt using distribution coefficients measured for the natural phase compositions. These computed abundances display LREE depletion. Such LREE-depleted abundance patterns cannot be generated by simple partial melting of a mafic mineral assemblage having the LREE-enriched patterns required for a two-stage Sm-Nd evolution history. This result implies that either (1) the melting process was complex (e.g., continuous melting), (2) the source region had a more complex history than that of the simple 2-stage model, or (3) Shergotty does not satisfy the closed-system assumption of the calculation, and has suffered post-magmatic LREE-enrichment. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Amphibole is one of the most important hydrous minerals of the middle and lower continental crust and plays a key role in the formation of intermediate to silica-rich magmas. This study reports a consistent set of amphibole trace element partition coefficients derived from fractional crystallization experiments at 0.7 GPa in a piston cylinder apparatus. Starting materials were doped with trace elements on the 20--40 ppm level and measured using laser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS. Amphibole is stable from 1010 to 730 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C and systematically changes its composition from pargasite to magnesiohornblende to cummingtonite, while coexisting liquids vary from andesite to dacite and rhyolite. Amphibole--liquid partition coefficients increase systematically with decreasing temperature and increasing SiO2 in the liquid. Potassium displays an inverse behavior and partitioning decreases with decreasing temperature. Rare earth element (REE) partition coefficients, assumed to occupy the M4 site within the amphibole structure, increase continuously up to one order of magnitude. The calculated lattice parameters, ideal cation radius (r 0) and Young's modulus (E) remain nearly constant with decreasing temperature. The high-field strength elements Zr and Hf that occupy the M2 site of the amphibole structure reveal a fivefold increase in partition coefficients with decreasing temperature and constant lattice parameters r 0 and E. Partition coefficients correlate with edenite, tschermaks and cummingtonite exchange vectors indicating that the maximum partition coefficient (D 0) for an ideal cation radius increases with decreasing edenite component, while the latter decreases linearly with temperature. Regressing Amph/L D Ca against trace elements results in fair to excellent correlations (r 2 0.55--0.99) providing a predictive tool to implement the trace element partition coefficients in numerical geochemical modeling. Our data result in positive correlations between Amph/L D Nb/Ta and Amph/L D Ca, and Mg{\{}{\#}{\}}. Spoon-shaped REE patterns and subchondritic Nb/Ta ratios in tonalitic to granodioritic plutonic rocks and andesitic to rhyolitic magmas directly constrained by measured trace element compositions of coexisting liquids are consistent with hornblende gabbro fractionation in the middle to lower crust. The systematic change of the measured trace element composition of fractionating calc-alkaline liquids indicates that hornblende gabbro formation in the middle to lower crust also exerts an important control on some commonly used trace element ratios such as Sr/Y, Sr/Ba or Nb/Zr.},

abstract = {The Gr{\o}nnedal-Ika complex is dominated by layered nepheline syenites which were intruded by a xenolithic syenite and a central plug of calcite to calcite-siderite carbonatite. Aegirine-augite, alkali feldspar and nepheline are the major mineral phases in the syenites, along with rare calcite. Temperatures of 680-910°C and silica activities of 0{\textperiodcentered}28-0{\textperiodcentered}43 were determined for the crystallization of the syenites on the basis of mineral equilibria. Oxygen fugacities, estimated using titanomagnetite compositions, were between 2 and 5 log units above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer during the magmatic stage. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of magmatic calcite in both carbonatites and syenites are characterized by REE enrichment (LaCN-YbCN = 10-70). Calcite from the carbonatites has higher Ba (∼5490 ppm) and lower HREE concentrations than calcite from the syenites (54-106 ppm Ba). This is consistent with the behavior of these elements during separation of immiscible silicate-carbonate liquid pairs. $\epsilon$Nd(T = 1{\textperiodcentered}30 Ga) values of clinopyroxenes from the syenites vary between +1{\textperiodcentered}8 and +2{\textperiodcentered}8, and $\epsilon$Nd(T) values of whole-rock carbonatites range from +2{\textperiodcentered}4 to +2{\textperiodcentered}8. Calcite from the carbonatites has $\delta$18O values of 7{\textperiodcentered}8 to 8{\textperiodcentered} 6‰ and $\delta$13C values of -3{\textperiodcentered}9 to - 4{\textperiodcentered} 6‰. $\delta$18O values of clinopyroxene separates from the nepheline syenites range between 4{\textperiodcentered}2 and 4{\textperiodcentered}9‰. The average oxygen isotopic composition of the nepheline syenitic melt was calculated based on known rock-water and mineral-water isotope fractionation to be 5{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}4‰. Nd and C-O isotope compositions are typical for mantle-derived rocks and do not indicate significant crustal assimilation for either syenite or carbonatite magmas. The difference in $\delta$18O between calculated syenitic melts and carbonatites, and the overlap in $\epsilon$ Nd values between carbonatites and syenites, are consistent with derivation of the carbonatites from the syenites via liquid immiscibility. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Twenty-two new K-Ar dates allow reorganization of the volcano-stratigraphy of the Kedong–Kinangop region on the east side of the central Kenya rift for the most recent 4 Ma, during which time most of the structural features evolved. Four principal phases of volcanic eruption were: widespread Kinangop tuff ash flows (3.7–3.4 Ma), Limuru flood trachytes (2.0–1.8 Ma), basalts and flood trachytes of the rift floor (1.65–0.9 Ma), Quaternary salic caldera volcanoes (0.4–0 Ma). K-Ar dating allows recognition of the Cobb Mountain normal polarity event at about 1.18 Ma, and dating of the Kedong flood at about 0.1 Ma. Major faulting occurred at 4–3 Ma, converting an early half-graben to a graben. Fault zones then migrated inwards progressively forming step-fault platforms at 3–2 Ma and 1.7 Ma, such that the graben narrowed with time. Extensive minor faulting of the rift floor occurred during the most recent 0.8 Ma. The average extension rate across the central rift was 3 mm a−1 for the last 7 Ma, and is close to plate tectonic estimates. Individual fault strain rates are estimated at 0.1–0.4 mm a−1. Faulting was episodic rather than continuous, and some episodes affected both sides of the rift. Volumes of magma erupted during 4–0 Ma require generation of at least 1.2 × 105 km3 of primary magma in the 200 km length of the south–central rift if fractional crystallization is the dominant differentiation mechanism. This volume implies mantle upflow either as an asthenosphere ‘plume', or as the result of lithosphere extension. The tectonic and magmatic sequence of events is proposed to result from lithosphere thinning, emplacement of large magma bodies in or near the lower crust, regional uplifts and superimposed limited lateral separation of the lithosphere as a result of plate motions.},

abstract = {Petrogenetic models for the origin of lamproites are evaluated using new major element, trace element, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope data for Holocene lamproites from the Gaussberg volcano in the East Antarctic Shield. Gaussberg lamproites exhibit very unusual Pb isotope compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 17{\textperiodcentered}44–17{\textperiodcentered}55 and 207Pb/204Pb = 15{\textperiodcentered}56–15{\textperiodcentered}63), which in common Pb isotope space plot above mantle evolution lines and to the left of the meteorite isochron. Combined with very unradiogenic Nd, such compositions are shown to be inconsistent with an origin by melting of sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Instead, a model is proposed in which late Archaean continent-derived sediment is subducted as K-hollandite and other ultra-high-pressure phases and sequestered in the Transition Zone (or lower mantle) where it is effectively isolated for 2–3 Gyr. The high 207Pb/204Pb ratio is thus inherited from ancient continent-derived sediment, and the relatively low 206Pb/204Pb ratio is the result of a single stage of U/Pb fractionation by subduction-related U loss during slab dehydration. Sr and Nd isotope ratios, and trace element characteristics (e.g. Nb/Ta ratios) are consistent with sediment subduction and dehydration-related fractionation. Similar models that use variable time of isolation of subducted sediment can be derived for all lamproites. Our interpretation of lamproite sources has important implications for ocean island basalt petrogenesis as well as the preservation of geochemically anomalous reservoirs in the mantle.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous M{\'{e}}gantic intrusive complex of southern Qu{\'{e}}bec contains early noritic gabbrodiorites which represent cumulates from crustally contaminated hawaiite to syenite magmas. Whole rock and mineral chemistry, as well as textural evidence, indicate that post-cumulus recrystallization and reaction were important, and most of the amphibole and biotite are thought to have formed in this way. A younger plutonic quartz-syenite ringdyke may not be cogenetic with the gabbro-diorites sice it lacks orthopyroxene. It may, however, be cogenetic with basaltic to riebeckite granite dykes. Fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, aluminous clinopyroxene, and minor Ti-magnetite from critically undersaturated alkali basaltic magmas generated hawaiitic magmas. The development of quartzbearing mugearitic and syenitic residua from the hawaiites can best be modelled by fractionation of amphibole, plagioclase, olivine, oxides, and apatite. Attempts to model fractionation using observed phenocrysts (including clinopyroxene) were unsuccessful. Amphibole fractionation is interpreted to have taken place through a reaction with still-porous, higher-temperature cumulates on the walls of the magma chamber. The plutonic syenites probably represent alkali feldspar cumulates from the residual syenitic melts. Magnesian calc-alkaline lamprophyres exhibit olivine to phlogopite reaction textures, are enriched in Cr, Ni, K, Rb, Nb, Y, Zr, and Si relative to the basaltic dykes, yet have similar incompatible element ratios. Their relation to the basalts is problematical. The late biotite-granite core to the complex is identical to typical White Mountain granites and may have formed as an anatectic cap on rising, fractionating, mantlederived magmas.},

abstract = {Magmatic sulfide deposits are divisible into two major groups, those that are valued primarily for their Ni and Cu and that are mostly sulfide rich ({\textgreater}10{\%} sulfide), and those that are valued primarily for their PGE and tend to be sulfide poor ({\textless}5{\%} sulfide). Most members of the Ni-Cu group formed as a result of an interaction of mantle-derived magma with the crust that gave rise to the early onset of sulfide immiscibility. Of the different classes of deposit in this group, the komatiite-related class ranges from 2.7 to 1.9 Ga in age, the Flood basalt-related class from 1.1 to 0.25 Ga, and the Mg basalt- and basalt-related group from the Archean to the present. There is only one example each of anorthosite complex- and impact-related deposits, so that one cannot generalize about their secular distribution, except to say that anorthosite complexes are Proterozoic. Ural-Alaskan intrusions are dominantly Phanerozoic (some Archean deposits have been included with this group), but as yet no examples have been found with economic sulfide bodies. Seventy-five percent of known PGE resources occur in three intrusions—the Bushveld, Great Dyke, and Stillwater, the rocks all of which have crystallized from two magma types, an unusual, high SiO2, MgO, and Cr and low Al2O3 type (U-type) that was emplaced at an early stage and a later, normal tholeiitic-type magma (T-type); the PGE are concentrated in layers close to the level at which the predominant crystallization switches from one magma type to the other. The U-type magma is interpreted as a PGE-rich, komatiitic magma (possibly the product of two-stage mantle melting) that has interacted to varying degrees with the crust, becoming SiO2 enriched in this way. These three intrusions are Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic in age. All known examples of komatiites, with one exception, are Paleoproterozoic or older and their secular distribution is thought to be due to cooling of the Earth. Known deposits do not occur in the oldest ({\textgreater}3.0 Ga) komatiites but appear at around 2.7Ga in continental (Kambalda, Western Australia) or island-arc (Perseverance-Mount Keith, Western Australia) environments, possibly because it was these environments that offered the opportunity for interaction with felsic rocks. It is suggested that the development of these environments in the Archean was an additional control on the age distribution of these deposits. It is postulated that the restricted secular distribution of PGE-enhanced intrusions is also due to the need for a hot mantle to give rise to U-type magmas.},

abstract = {Rifting at c. 1.71 Ga separated the Mealy Mountains terrane from pre-Labradorian Laurentia and resulted in a short-lived (backarc?) basin, followed by southward subduction giving rise to 1.68-1.66 Ga Labradorian calc-alkaline arcs, partly built on older crust in the Mealy Mountains terrane. The arcs and subduction were also short lived, terminating when accretion against the Makkovikian and Eastern Churchill provinces occurred at 1.65 Ga. The Trans-Labrador batholith developed as a result of crustal thickening during suturing of the 1.68-1.66 Ga arc-related rocks to pre-Labradorian Laurentia. Further bimodal magmatism, in response to crustal thickening, continued until c. 1.62 Ga, followed by waning granitic magmatism until 1.60 Ga.
The Labrador Orogen and older rocks in the Mealy Mountains terrane are flanked to the south by Pinwarian (1.51-1.45 Ga) granitoid rocks, possibly the inboard manifestation of a northward-subducting continental-margin arc at the southern margin of Laurentia. Extension, mostly coincident with the 1.71 Ga zone of weakness, started at c. 1.45 Ga. Although rifting was successful further west, it is only represented by basaltic magmatism (Michael and Shabogamo gabbros) along a linear zone in Labrador. Similar tectonism characterized the same zone periodically for at least the next 150 million years during which time the 1.27 Ga Harp-Nutak dykes were emplaced and slightly younger rocks of the Seal Lake Group formed north of the Grenville Province.
After c. 1.23 Ga tectonic conditions changed, partly in response to Elzevirian accretion of arc terranes preserved in the southwest Grenville Province, that are speculated to have once also existed south of the exposed eastern Grenville Province. Alternating compressional and extensional conditions terminated at c. 1.0 Ga during collisional orogenesis associated with the final stages of development of the Grenville Orogen. Grenvillian deformation in Labrador (1.08-0.97 Ga) resulted in northwesterly thrusting, the effects of which are focused in the Exterior Thrust Belt, and widespread plutonism in the Interior Magmatic Belt. Thrusting in the Exterior Thrust Belt is sited along the zone of 1.71 and 1.43 Ga rifting. Uplift and cooling continued until 0.90 Ga as crustal stability was gradually achieved.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic analysis of the system Na2O-K2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-F2O−1 provides phase equilibria and solidus compatibilities of rock-forming silicates and fluorides in evolved granitic systems and associated hydrothermal processes. The interaction of fluorine with aluminosilicate melts and solids corresponds to progressive fluorination of their constituent oxides by the thermodynamic component F2O−1. The chemical potential $\mu$(F2O−1) buffered by reaction of the type: MOn/2 (s)+n/2 [F2O−1]=MFn (s, g) where M=K, Na, Ca, Al, Si, explains the sequential formation of fluorides: carobbiite, villiaumite, fluorite, AlF3, SiF4 as well as the common coexistence of alkali- and alkali-earth fluorides with rock-forming aluminosilicates. Formation of fluorine-bearing minerals first starts in peralkaline silica-undersaturated, proceeds in peraluminous silica-oversaturated compositions and causes progressive destabilization of nepheline, albite and quartz, in favour of villiaumite, cryolite, topaz, chiolite. Additionally, it implies the increase of buffered fluorine solubilities in silicate melts or aqueous fluids from peralkaline silica-undersaturated to peraluminous silica-oversaturated environments. Subsolidus equilibria reveal several incompatibilities: (i) topaz is unstable with nepheline or villiaumite; (ii) chiolite is not compatible with albite because it only occurs only at very high F2O−1 levels. The stability of topaz, fluorite, cryolite and villiaumite in natural felsic systems is related to their peralkalinity (peraluminosity), calcia and silica activity, and linked by corresponding chemical potentials to rock-forming mineral buffers. Villiaumite is stable in strongly peralkaline and Ca-poor compositions (An{\textless}0.001). Similarly, cryolite stability requires coexistence with nearly-pure albite (An{\textless}2). Granitic rocks with Ca-bearing plagioclase (An{\textgreater}5) saturate with topaz or fluorite. Crystallization of topaz is restricted to peraluminous conditions, consistent with the presence of Li-micas or anhydrous aluminosilicates (cordierite, garnet, andalusite). Fluorite is predicted to be stable in peraluminous biotite granites, amphibole-, clinopyroxene- or titanite-bearing calc-alkaline suites as well as in peralkaline granitic and syenitic rocks. Fluorine concentrations in felsic melts buffered by the coexistence of F-bearing minerals and feldspars increase from peralkaline through metaluminous to mildly peraluminous compositions. At low-temperature conditions, the hydrothermal evolution of peraluminous granitic and greisen systems is controlled by white mica-feldspar-fluoride equilibria. With decreasing temperature, topaz gradually breaks down via: (i) (OH)F−1 substitution and fluorine transfer to fluorite by decalcification of plagioclase below 600 °C, (ii) formation of muscovite and additional fluorite at 475–315 °C, and (iii) formation of paragonite and cryolite, consuming F-rich topaz and albite below 315 °C. These equilibria explain the absence of magmatic fluorite in Ca-bearing topaz granitic rocks; its abundance in hydrothermal rocks is due to: (i) closed-system defluorination of topaz, (ii) open-system decalcification of plagioclase or (iii) hydrolytic alteration. These results provide a complete framework for the investigation of fluorine-bearing mineral stabilities in felsic igneous suites.},

abstract = {Hotspots are anomalous regions of volcanism at Earth's surface that show no obvious association with tectonic plate boundaries. Classic examples include the Hawaiian-Emperor chain and the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain province. The majority are believed to form as Earth's tectonic plates move over long-lived mantle plumes: buoyant upwellings that bring hot material from Earth's deep mantle to its surface. It has long been recognized that lithospheric thickness limits the rise height of plumes and, thereby, their minimum melting pressure. It should, therefore, have a controlling influence on the geochemistry of plume-related magmas, although unambiguous evidence of this has, so far, been lacking. Here we integrate observational constraints from surface geology, geochronology, plate-motion reconstructions, geochemistry and seismology to ascertain plume melting depths beneath Earth's longest continental hotspot track, a 2,000-kilometre-long track in eastern Australia that displays a record of volcanic activity between 33 and 9 million years ago, which we call the Cosgrove track. Our analyses highlight a strong correlation between lithospheric thickness and magma composition along this track, with: (1) standard basaltic compositions in regions where lithospheric thickness is less than 110 kilometres; (2) volcanic gaps in regions where lithospheric thickness exceeds 150 kilometres; and (3) low-volume, leucitite-bearing volcanism in regions of intermediate lithospheric thickness. Trace-element concentrations from samples along this track support the notion that these compositional variations result from different degrees of partial melting, which is controlled by the thickness of overlying lithosphere. Our results place the first observational constraints on the sub-continental melting depth of mantle plumes and provide direct evidence that lithospheric thickness has a dominant influence on the volume and chemical composition of plume-derived magmas.},

abstract = {The Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1140-1120 Ma) ferrocarbonatite dykes of Swartbooisdrif, northwestern Namibia, transect the anorthositic rocks of the Kunene Intrusive Complex. The ferrocarbonatite is mainly composed of ankerite and magnetite, and is highly contaminated by fragmented and fenitized wallrock anorthosite (albite, biotite and sodalite), with Fe-Cu-Ni sulfides (assemblage: pyrite, chalcopyrite, millerite, polydymite, fletcherite) being widespread minor components. In order to constrain the compositional evolution and to reconstruct the T-f(O-2) conditions during progressive crystallization and subsolidus re-equilibration of the ferrocarbonatites, a detailed study of the mineral chemistry and sulfur isotope signatures of the sulfide mineralization has been carried out. Owing to the finely intergrown nature of the sulfide assemblages, sulfur isotope analysis has been performed using an in situ laser-microprobe technique. The delta S-34 values of early carbonatite-hosted pyrite range from 3.8 to 5.1 parts per thousand, Similar delta S-34 values were obtained for metasomatically formed pyrite from the fenitized anorthosites (+3.3 to +3.4 parts per thousand). Distinctly lower, negative delta S-34 values have been determined for pyrite (-2.4 to -2.1 parts per thousand) and chalcopyrite (-3.3 to 0.0 parts per thousand) in late sulfide-oxide veins, with the lowest values obtained for sulfides from samples that contain additional secondary barite. This overall isotopic trend is interpreted in terms of changing proportions of oxidized and reduced sulfur species in the carbonatite-derived fluids, and is supported by calculations of phase equilibria in the system Cu-Fe-S-O-H and modeling of isotopic mass-balance. During the early stage of mineralization, the oxygen fugacity was presumably low, with reduced sulfur species (H2S, HS-) dominant in the fluids, promoting the precipitation of pyrite and the metasomatic formation of nearly pure, SO4-free socialite. A subsequent increase in f(O-2) led to a systematic increase in the Sigma SO4/Sigma H2S ratio of the fluid. This resulted in a depletion of S-34 in the residual reduced sulfur, which is manifested by the negative delta S-34 values of the late sulfide mineralization.},

abstract = {The kinetics of Fe oxidation-reduction in two hydrous rhyolitic melts, one metaluminous and the other peralkaline, have been studied at 800 °C, 2kb, for melt water contents from {\~{}}5 wt{\%} to saturation and fO2 between NNO-2 and NNO + 3 (NNO = nickel-nickel oxide redox buffer). The metaluminous melt ({\~{}}1 wt{\%} FeOT) reached redox equilibrium after 10 hours and the peralkaline one ({\~{}}3 wt{\%} FeOT) after 3 hours. The kinetics of Fe oxidation and reduction are similar and unaffected by the presence or absence of a hydrous fluid phase. No redox front is observable in the glass as the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio evolves, implying that the Fe redox kinetics in hydrous silicic melts is rate-limited neither by the diffusion of H2 nor by the mobilities of divalent cations, as observed for anhydrous basaltic melts. We propose a two-step reaction mechanism that involves: (1) virtually instantaneous diffusion of H2 in the sample, followed by (2) slower structural/chemical reorganizations around Fe atoms. The overall redox process involving iron and hydrogen in Fe-poor, H2O-rich melts is thus reaction-limited and obeys a first-order logarithmic rate law. The relatively slow kinetics of oxidation/reduction explains why melt Fe3+/Fe2+ can be readily quenched in laboratory experiments. Simulation of oxidation of magmas due to H2 exchange with wall rocks is performed using these new kinetics laws and two DH2values extracted from the literature. We demonstrate that the metaluminous composition is not significantly modified whereas the peralkaline composition undergoes important and fast changes of Fe3+/Fe2+ during short processes such as ascent prior to Plinian-style eruptions.},

abstract = {Based on petrography, mineral chemistry, and petrology, the physico-chemical evolution of an agpaitic dyke was found to be very similar to that of the neighbouring Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex. Various mineral assemblages were used to reconstruct the crystallization conditions of the dyke rock for different stages during cooling. The early magmatic phenocryst assemblage is alkali feldspar + nepheline + augite + olivine + magnetite and indicates liquidus temperatures of {\~{}}850°C, silica activities of {\~{}}0.5, and oxygen fugacities of FMQ −1.5 to −3. The groundmass assemblage albite + microcline + nepheline + sodalite + arfvedsonite + aegirine + aenigmatite + astrophyllite indicates lower temperatures of between 600 and 450°C, at silica activities of 0.25, and oxygen fugacities around the FMQ buffer. Amphibole composition strongly responds to fluorite saturation and proves crystallization occurred in a system closed to oxygen. Late-stage hydrothermal conditions are indicated by the conversion of nepheline and sodalite to analcime and the growth of aegirine on arfvedsonite. These late-stage reactions are constrained to temperatures of {\textless}300°C, water activities of between 0.5 and unity, and oxygen fugacities above MH. The dyke has to be regarded as a small equivalent of the larger Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex, in which identical differentiation processes proceeded at a scale very different in terms of magma volume and cooling times.},

Plg–hbl–cpx saturated liquids diverge from plg–hbl–opx saturated liquids, consistent with the MSH–Yn−1 dacite marking a liquid composition along a peritectic distributary reaction boundary where hbl appears down-temperature as opx + cpx are consumed. The abun-dance of saturating phases along this distributary peritec-tic (liquid + hbl + opx + cpx + plg + oxides) reduces the variance, so liquids are restricted to dacite–granodiorite– tonalite compositions. Higher-K dacites than the Yn would also saturate with biotite, further limiting their composi-tional diversity. Theoretical evaluation of the energetics of peritectic melting of pargasitic amphiboles indicates that melting and crystallization of amphibole occur abruptly, proximal to amphibole's high-temperature stability limit, which causes the system to dwell thermally under the con-ditions that produce dacitic compositions. This process may account for the compositional homogeneity of dacites, granodiorites, and tonalites in arc settings, but their rela-tive mobility compared to rhyolitic/granitic liquids likely accounts for their greater abundance.},

Based on magmatic to solid-state flow textures such as foliations and lineations, we propose that the investigated rock sequence forms a sill-like structure with a steep feeder zone that flattens out over a short distance and intrudes into less evolved overlying units as sub-horizontal sheets by roof uplift. Systematic compositional variation of early-magmatic eudialyte-group minerals (EGM) in the investigated rock sequence monitors the geochemical evolution of the lujavrite-forming melt(s). The chlorine contents of EGM decrease successively upwards within the rock sequence, which probably indicates a successive increase of water activity during differentiation, consistent with a change from sodic pyroxene (aegirine) to sodic amphibole (arfvedsonite) in the mineral assemblage. Both REE contents and Fe/Mn ratios of EGM are promising differentiation indicators, which increase and decrease, respectively, upwards within the sequence due to fractional crystallization. This closed-system evolution is interrupted by a shift towards less evolved melt compositions in one lujavrite unit, for which we assume magma recharge. Our study demonstrates the strength of a combined structural and petrological approach to understand the petrogenesis of an igneous body in more detail and highlights their close connection.},

Each separate and the bulk sample was dissolved by 1) lithium metaborate fusion and 2) Parr bomb digestion utilizing 29 mol l−1 hydrofluoric (HF) and 16 mol l−1 nitric (HNO3) acids. In situ analyses were performed using laser ablation ICP-MS and demonstrate that, on the basis of REE, two types of inclusions are present: 1) those with a positive Ce anomaly and 2) those with no Ce anomaly. The former type of inclusion appears to be smaller than the latter. Analysis of the digested samples for the rare earth elements (REE) was then performed using a quadrupole ICP-MS. Comparison of the chondrite-normalized REE patterns for the different fractions gave apparent positive anomalies at Sm and Eu in the acid digestions but not in the fused samples. Zirconium has five isotopes (90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr, 94Zr and 96Zr) and there is a strong tendency for Zr to combine with fluorine (19 F). Based on calculations and experiments, the increased levels of Sm and Eu in the acid digested samples were due to interferences of 90Zr19 F3 on 147 Sm and of 94Zr19 F3 on 151 Eu. Decreasing the ratio of HF:HNO3 did not remove these interferences, nor did post-treatment with perchloric acid. A mathematical method was developed to correct for these polyatomic interferences.},

abstract = {Planets are built from planetesimals: solids larger than a kilometer which grow by colliding pairwise. Planetesimals themselves are unlikely to form by two-body collisions; sub-km objects have gravitational fields individually too weak, and electrostatic attraction is too feeble for growth beyond a few cm. We review the possibility that planetesimals form when self-gravity brings together vast ensembles of small particles. Even when self-gravity is weak, aerodynamic processes can accumulate solids relative to gas, paving the way for gravitational collapse. Particles pile up as they drift radially inward. Gas turbulence stirs particles, but can also seed collapse by clumping them. While the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical shear instabilities that obstruct self-gravity, this same feedback triggers streaming instabilities that strongly concentrate particles. Numerical simulations find that solids 10-100 cm in size gravitationally collapse in turbulent disks. We outline areas for progress, including the possibility that still smaller objects self-gravitate.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the results of an investigation carried out on young volcanic rocks from the Gedemsa and Fanta 'Ale complexes, located in the Main Ethiopian Rift, the site of an intense magmatism since Eocene–Oligocene. The earlier NW–SE direction of extension of the Rift, which generated NE–SW trending faults, rotated around E–W in Quaternary times, and produced the still active N to N–NE Wonji Fault System. The Gedemsa volcano is located in the central part of the Ethiopian Rift, about 100 km SE of Addis Ababa. It is characterized by a wide central caldera, about 8 km in diameter. The general stratigraphic sequence in the area includes, from base upwards, rift-floor ignimbrites, pantelleritic and subordinate trachytic pyroclastic deposits and lava flows and domes, and widespread basaltic deposits. The Fanta 'Ale volcanic complex is located in the northern part of the Main Ethiopian Rift, where the Afar depression begins. It is characterized by a summit caldera of which the diameter is about 4 km. This volcano erupted trachytic and rhyolitic lavas, whereas the most diffuse unit is an ignimbrite related to the caldera collapse. Explosive activity has occurred inside and outside the caldera, forming tuff cones and thick pumice-fallout deposits. The only mafic unit is represented by a basaltic eruption that occurred in 1870 AD. Historical eruptions and intense fumarolic activity are evidence for the persistence activity of the Fanta 'Ale in this part of the Main Ethiopian Rift. New geochemical and Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data on representative samples from Gedemsa and Fanta 'Ale volcanoes are presented and discussed in order to shed light on the genesis of mafic and felsic magmas, the genetic link between them, and their possible interaction with the local crust. Volcanic rocks show a typical mafic–felsic bi-modal distribution with few intermediate terms (Daly Gap), as observed at regional scale along the Main Ethiopian Rift as well as on the plateau. Geochemical data and modeling suggest that magmas evolved mainly through fractional crystallization processes, accounting for the entire mafic–felsic compositional variation. However, Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data reveal also open-system evolution processes. The most differentiated, Sr-poor rhyolites suffered important low temperature contamination by shallow fluids of hydrothermal and/or meteoric origin. This affected mostly the Sr isotopic composition of whole-rocks, and much less that of separated feldspars that provide more reliable 87Sr/86Sr values. Mafic rocks, as well as the least contaminated felsic rocks, provide evidence for two components involved in the genesis and evolution of mafic magmas: a mantle component, carrying the isotopic composition of the Afar plume, and a crustal component, likely Pan-African sialic lower crust, that might have been added in small amounts, about 2{\%}, to mafic magmas. The origin of the primary magmas is inferred to have occurred by 7{\%} partial melting of a mixed source region including both depleted and enriched mantle components.},

abstract = {Gabbroic sills of the widespread, ca. 720 Ma Franklin large igneous event intruded sedimentary strata of the Neoproterozoic Shaler Supergroup exposed in the Minto Inlier on Victoria Island in the western Arctic. The mafic magmatism occurred during breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and preceded Sturtian glaciation. Calc-silicate metamorphic reactions produced CO2 from decameter-scale contact aureoles in carbonate rocks containing variable amounts of silicates. Numerical modeling of the reactions and fluid flow was done for host-rock permeabilities (k) ranging from 10–18 to 10–14 m2. Metamorphic assemblages and aureoles widths are best reproduced with k between 10–18 and 10–17 m2; however, the lower k produces much broader fracture zones next to the sills than those observed in the field. When k ≥ 10–16 m2, the contribution of advective heat transport produces aureoles that are too thick. With k = 10–17 m2, the contribution of CO2 to the atmosphere from the aureole of one 50-m-thick sill with an area of 50,000 km2 would have been only 8 ppm (by weight) during the 600 yr metamorphic episode. The sedimentary basin would have to have been more permeable for a higher flux of metamorphic CO2 to the atmosphere. The results demonstrate that host-rock permeability must be considered before changes in the budgets of atmospheric carbonic gases can be attributed to metamorphic degassing from sedimentary basins.},

The crystals grew in the liquid with a rate that did not exceed the diffusion rate of most elements in the liquid. However. Fe3+ seems to have had diffusion rates lower than the crystal growth rate, and this probably caused the development of some sectors enriched in acmite and others enriched in the hedenbergite component. For Al, Ti and Zr a crystal structural control is envisaged although a recent structure-based model for sector zoning fails to explain the efficient separation of these elements into different sectors. Three more occurrences of sector zoned aegirine are noted, all from peralkaline nepheline syenites. The phenomenon is probably more widespread than hitherto realised.},

Phases crystallize in the order olivine, chromium spinel, pyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite during equilibrium crystallization, but ilmenite and plagioclase reverse their order of appearance and silica crystallizes in the groundmass during controlled cooling experiments. The partition of iron and magnesium between olivine and liquid (KD = 0.33) is independent of cooling rate (0.5° to 2000°C/hr), temperature (1325° to 600°C), and pressure (0 to 12 kb). Comparison of the olivine nucleation densities in the lunar sample and in the experiments indicates that the sample began cooling at about l°C/hr. Pyroxene size, chemistry, and growth instability spacings (“swallowtails”), as well as groundmass coarseness, all suggest that the cooling rate subsequently decreased by as much as a factor of 10 or more. The porphyritic texture of this sample, then, is produced at a decreasing, rather than a discontinuously increasing, cooling rate.},

abstract = {Plate tectonics plays a vital role in the evolution of our planet. Geochemical analysis of Earth[rsquor]s oldest continental crust suggests that subduction may have begun episodically about 3.8 to 3.2 billion years ago, during the early Archaean or perhaps more than 3.8 billion years ago, during the Hadean. Yet, mantle rocks record evidence for modern-style plate tectonics beginning only in the late Archaean, about 3 billion years ago. Here we analyse the nitrogen abundance, as well as the nitrogen and carbon isotopic signatures of Archaean placer diamonds from the Kaapvaal craton, South Africa, which formed in the upper mantle 3.1 to 3.5 billion years ago. We find that the diamonds have enriched nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions compared with typical mantle values. This nitrogen geochemical fingerprint could have been caused by contamination of the mantle by nitrogen-rich Archaean sediments. Furthermore, the carbon isotopic signature suggests that the diamonds formed by reduction of an oxidized fluid or melt. Assuming that the Archaean mantle was more reduced than the modern mantle, we argue that the oxidized components were introduced to the mantle by crustal recycling at subduction zones. We conclude, on the basis of evidence from mantle-derived diamonds, that modern-style plate tectonics operated as early as 3.5 billion years ago.},

Komatiites from Gorgona Island were formed by relatively low degrees of pseudoinvariant melting ({\textless} 30{\%}) involving L + Ol + Opx + Cpx + Gt on the solidus at 40 kbar, about 130 km depth. Munro-type komatiites were separated from a harzburgite residue (L + Ol + Opx) at pressures that are poorly constrained, but were probably around 50 kbar, about 165 km depth; the degree of partial melting was {\textless}40{\%}. Komatiites from the Barberton Mountain Land were formed by high degrees (∼50{\%}) of pseudoinvariant melting (L + Ol + Gt + Cpx) of fertile mantle peridotite in the 80- to 100-kbar range, about 260- to 330- km depth. Secular variations in the geochemistry of komatiites could have formed in response to a reduction in the temperature and pressure of melting with time. The 3.5 Ga Barberton komatiites and the 2.7 Ga Munro-type komatiites could have formed in plumes that were hotter than the present-day mantle by 500° and 300°, respectively. When excess temperatures are this size, melting is deeper and volcanism changes from basaltic to komatiitic. The komatiites from Gorgona Island, which are Mesozoic in age, may be representative of komatiites that are predicted to occur in oceanic plateaus of Cretaceous age throughout the Pacific [Storey et al., 1991].},

abstract = {The petrogenesis of igneous rocks can be controlled significantly by the mixing of dissimilar magmas. Within the contexts of basaltic and silicic magma chambers and komatiite lava flows we identify circumstances in which the extent to which contrasting magmas are mixed by natural convection potentially controls their differentiation. To evaluate the amount of mixing in each context, we apply the experimental results from part 1 [Jellinek et al., this issue] of this study, in which we quantified the conditions under which fluids could be mixed by convection at large Rayleigh numbers ({\textgreater} 1011). When our laboratory results are applied to basaltic magma chambers, we find that convection driven by compositionally buoyant magma released during floor crystallization or floor dissolution will produce partial to nearly complete mixing of the ascending fluid in chambers that are tens of meters to kilometers high, respectively. We also conclude that substantial floor melting (with extensive mixing) is expected only for basaltic chambers emplaced in the deep crust. During the turbulent flow of Archean komatiites, underlying sediments melted by forced convective heat transfer are predicted to have been mixed nearly completely into the overriding lavas. During the replenishment of silicic magma chambers by basaltic magmas we predict that the convection of buoyant silicic magma overrun by a spreading injection of denser basalt will cause little mixing. However, after emplacement, heat transfer from a basalt layer will gradually melt and mobilize its felsic floor, producing a small flux of buoyant felsic liquid that will be mixed extensively.},

abstract = {In most published hydrothermal ore deposit models, the main agent of metal transport is an aqueous liquid. However, there is increasing evidence from volcanic vapors, geothermal systems (continental and submarine), vapor-rich fluid inclusions, and experimental studies that the vapor phase may be an important and even dominant ore fluid in some hydrothermal systems. This paper reviews the evidence for the transport of metals by vapor (which we define as an aqueous fluid of any composition with a density lower than its critical density), clarifies some of the thermodynamic controls that may make such transport possible, and suggests a model for the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits that involves precipitation of the ores from vapor or a vapor-derived fluid. Analyses of vapor (generally {\textgreater}90{\%} water) released from volcanic fumaroles at temperatures from 500° to over 900°C and near-atmospheric pressure typically yield concentrations of ore metals in the parts per billion to parts per million range. These vapors also commonly deposit appreciable quantities of ore minerals as sublimates. Much higher metal concentrations (from ppm to wt {\%}) are observed in vapor inclusions trapped at pressures of 200 to 1,000 bars in deeper veins at lower temperatures (400°–650°C). Moreover, concentrations of some metals, notably Cu and Au, are commonly higher in vapor inclusions than they are in inclusions of coexisting hypersaline liquid (brine). Experiments designed to determine the concentration of Cu, Sn, Ag, and Au in HCl-bearing water vapor at variable although relatively low pressures (up to 180 bars) partly explain this difference. These experiments show that metal solubility is orders of magnitude higher than predicted by volatility data for water-free systems, and furthermore that it increases sharply with increasing water fugacity and correlates positively with the fugacity of HCl. Thermodynamic analysis shows that metal solubility is greatly enhanced by reaction of the metal with HCl and by hydration, which results in the formation of species such as MeClm.nH2O. Nonetheless, the concentrations measured by these experiments are considerably lower than those measured in experiments involving aqueous liquids or determined for vapor fluid inclusions. A possible explanation for this and for the apparent preference of metals such as Cu and Au for the vapor over the coexisting brine in some natural settings is suggested by limited experimental studies of metal partitioning between vapor and brine. These studies show that, whereas Cu, Fe, and Zn all partition strongly into the liquid in chloride-bearing sulfur-free systems, Cu partitions preferentially into the vapor in the presence of significant concentrations of sulfur. We therefore infer that high concentrations of Cu and Au in vapor inclusions reflect the strong preference of sulfur for the vapor phase and the formation of sulfur-bearing metallic gas species. Phase stability relationships in the system NaCl-H2O indicate how vapor transport of metals may occur in nature, by showing a range of possible vapor evolution paths for the conditions of porphyry-epithermal systems. At the world-class Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Au deposit, evidence from fluid inclusions supports a model in which a single-phase fluid of intermediate to vapor-like density ascends from a magma chamber. On cooling and decompression, this fluid condenses a small fraction of brine by intersecting the two-phase surface on the vapor side of the critical curve, without significantly changing the composition of the expanding vapor. Vapor and brine reach Cu-Fe sulfide saturation as both phases cool below 425°C. Vapor, which is the dominant fluid in terms of the total mass of H2O, Cu, and probably even Cl, is interpreted to be the main agent of metal transport. The evolution of fluids leading to high-grade epithermal gold mineralization is initiated by an H2S-, SO2-, Au-, and variably Cu- and As-rich vapor, which separates from an FeCl2-rich brine in a subjacent porphyry environment. In the early stages of the hydrothermal system, vapor expands rapidly and on reaching the epithermal environment, condenses, producing hypogene advanced argillic alteration and residual vuggy quartz and, in some cases, coeval high-sulfidation precious metal mineralization (e.g., Pascua). More commonly, the introduction of precious metals occurs somewhat later, after the site of magmatic fluid exsolution has receded to greater depth. Because of the relatively high pressure, the vapor separating from brine at this stage cools along a pressure-temperature path above the critical curve of the system, causing it to contract to a liquid capable of transporting several parts per million Au to temperatures as low as 150°C.},

abstract = {It is thought that the first continental crust formed by melting of either eclogite or amphibolite, either at subduction zones or on the underside of thick oceanic crust. However, the observed compositions of early crustal rocks and experimental studies have been unable to distinguish between these possibilities. Here we show a clear contrast in trace-element ratios of melts derived from amphibolites and those from eclogites. Partial melting of low-magnesium amphibolite can explain the low niobium/tantalum and high zirconium/samarium ratios in melts, as required for the early continental crust, whereas the melting of eclogite cannot. This indicates that the earliest continental crust formed by melting of amphibolites in subduction-zone environments and not by the melting of eclogite or magnesium-rich amphibolites in the lower part of thick oceanic crust. Moreover, the low niobium/tantalum ratio seen in subduction-zone igneous rocks of all ages is evidence that the melting of rutile-eclogite has never been a volumetrically important process.},

abstract = {The late Cretaceous-early Tertiary flood basalts in the Gujarat area of the northwestern Deccan Traps (Kathiawar peninsula, Pavagadh hills and Rajpipla) exhibit a wide range of compositions, from picrite basalts to rhyolites; moreover, the basaltic rocks have clearly distinct TiO2 contents at any given degree of differentiation and strongly resemble the low-titanium and hightitanium basalts found in most of the Gondwana continental flood basalt (CFB) suites. Four magma groups are petrologically and geochemically distinguished: (1) A low-Ti group, characterized by rocks with varying SiO2 saturation, and with TiO2 {\textless}1⋅8 wt{\%}, extremely low incompatible trace element abundances, low Zr/$\gamma$ (av- 3⋅8), Ti/ V (av. 27), and a very slight large ion lithophile element (LJLE) enrichment over high field strength elements (HFSE). These rocks share some features with the Bushe Formation of the Western Ghats farther south, but have distinct geochemical characters, in particular the strong depletion in most incompatible trace elements. (2) A high-Ti group, characterized by a more K-rich character than the low-Ti rocks, and with a strong enrichment in incompatible elements, similar to average ocean island basalt (OIB), e.g. high TiO2 ({\textgreater}1⋅8 wt{\%} in picrites), Nb ({\textgreater}19 p.p.m.) Zr/$\gamma$ (av. 6⋅5) and Tt/V (av. 47). (3) An intermediate-Ti group, with TiO2 contents slightly lower than the high-Ti rocks at the same degree of evolution, and with correspondingly lower incompatible trace element contents and ratios, in particular K2O, Nb, Ba and Zr/Y (av. 5⋅2). (4) A potassium-rich group (KT), broadly similar in geochemical character to the high-Ti group but showing more extreme K, Rb and Ba enrichment (av. K20/Na20∼l; Ba/Y∼20). The most primitive low-Ti and high-Ti picrites, when corrected for low-pressure olivine fractionation, show distinct major (and trace) element geochemistry, in particular for CaO/AI2O3, CaO/TiO2 and Al2O3/TiO2, and moderate but significant variations in their SiO2 and Fe2Ost contents; these characteristics strongly suggest the involvement of different mantle sources, more depleted for the low-Ti picrites, and richer in cpxfor the high-Ti picrites, but with broadly the same pressures of equilibration (27–14 kbar). This, in turn, suggests a strong lateral heterogeneity in the Gujarat Trap mantle. Low-Ti picrites and related differentiates in Kathiawar are reported systematically for the first time here, and suggest the existence of HFSE-depleted mantle in the northwestern Deccan Traps, with extension at least to the Seychelles Islands and to the area of the Bushe Formation near Bombay in the pre-drift position, before the development of the Carlsberg Ridge. The absence of correlations between LILE/HFSE ratios and SiO2 argues against crustal contamination processes acting on the low-Ti picrites, possibly owing to their probably rapid uprise to the surface. Consequently, the mantle region of this rock group was probably re-enriched by small amounts of ULE-rich materials. The substantially higher, trace element enrichment of the least differentiated high-Ti picrites, relative to the basalts of the Ambe-noli and Mahableshwar Formations of the Western Ghats, testifies also to the presence of more incompatible element rich, OIB4ike mantle sources in northern and northwestern Gujarat. These sources were geochemicaily similar to the present-day Reunion mantle sources.},

abstract = {Dynamic crystallization experiments on an olivine tholeiite from the Taos volcanic field, New Mexico have shown that the presence or absence of heterogeneous nuclei are an important factor in the development of texture. Heterogeneous nuclei of various kinds and numbers per unit volume (density) were produced by partially melting a crystalline basalt starting material. Several matrices of experiments were constructed with cooling rate, melt time, and melt temperature as the principal variables. Variations in melt time and temperature above and below the stability temperatures of olivine (1198 °C) and plagioclase (1187 °C) produced different numbers of unmelted remnants of either olivine and plagioclase or just olivine. Results indicate that differences in texture comparable to those produced by varying cooling rate can be produced by varying the kind and density of nuclei. The full range of textures produced by the range of cooling rates studied (0{\textperiodcentered}5 °C to 50 °C/hr) can be produced at a single cooling rate just by varying the nucleating heterogeneities. These heterogeneities behave like unmelted remnants but smaller than can be seen in the optical microscope, probably less than 0{\textperiodcentered}1 micrometers. Olivine appears to be able to nucleate on substrates other than olivine while plagioclase appears to nucleate only on itself or a similarly complex tectosilicate. The theory of heterogeneous nucleation suggests that nucleation sites are stabilized above their melting temperatures because they are trapped in cavities of refractory impurities. The high surface tension maintained in these cavities retards melting for some period of time and to some degree of superheat. It appears most likely, based on this study, that when plagioclase appears in a crystallized basaltic magma it was preceded by heterogeneous nucleation. Since plagioclase is a primary factor in defining texture, the texture itself then is a function primarily of heterogeneous nucleation.},

abstract = {Volcanoes are increasingly recognized as agents and recorders of global climate variability, although deciphering the linkages between planetary climate and volcanism is still in its infancy. The growth and emergence of subaqueous volcanoes produce passage zones, which are stratigraphic surfaces marking major transitions in depositional environments. In glaciovolcanic settings, they record the elevations of syn-eruptive englacial lakes. Thus, they allow for forensic recovery of minimum ice thicknesses. Here we present the first description of a passage zone preserved entirely within pyroclastic deposits, marking the growth of a tephra cone above the englacial lake level. Our discovery requires extension of the passage-zone concept to accommodate explosive volcanism and guides future studies of hundreds of glaciovolcanic edifices on Earth and Mars. Our recognition of pyroclastic passage zones increases the potential for recovering transient paleolake levels, improving estimates of paleo-ice thicknesses and providing new constraints on paleoclimate models that consider the extents and timing of planetary glaciations.},

abstract = {We present 16 new manometric determinations of H2O solubility for a range of natural silicate liquid compositions equilibrated up to 3 kbar of H2O pressure. As the threshold temperature of dehydration of the quenched glasses during measurements of the H2O con- tent becomes lower as a function both of bulk silicate composition and the dissolved H2O content, we measured the H2O released on heating over a range of temperature intervals. For example, alkali-rich samples having a dissolved H2O content greater than ;6 wt{\%} start to evolve H2O at temperatures less than 150 8C, whereas more mafic samples and silicic samples with less than 6 wt{\%} H2O begin to dehydrate at temperatures greater than 200 8C. This behavior is consistent with the concept that alkali-rich liquids can have their glass transition temperatures lowered substantially by dissolved H2O and that H2O is re- leased only significantly on heating in the supercooled liquid region, rather than in the glass region. Using these new data, in conjunction with previous data from the literature, we refined and extended the empirical H2O solubility model of Moore et al. (1995b). The new model works well (2s 5 6 0.5 wt{\%}) between 700–1200 8C and 1–3000 bar and can be applied to any natural silicate liquid in that range. The model may also be used for systems where XH2O , 1 in the vapor phase.},

abstract = {Trace element partition coefficients (D's) for up to 13 REE, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Sr and Y have been determined by SIMS analysis of seven garnets, four clinopyroxenes, one orthopyroxene and one phlogopite crystallized from an undoped basanite and a lightly doped (200 ppm Nb, Ta and Hf) quartz tholeiite. Experiments were conducted at 2–7.5 GPa, achieving near-liquidus crystallization at relatively low temperatures of 1080–1200°C under strongly hydrous conditions (5–27 wt.{\%} added water). Garnet and pyroxene DREE show a parabolic pattern when plotted against ionic radius, and conform closely to the lattice strain model of Blundy and Wood (Blundy, J.D., Wood, B.J., 1994. Prediction of crystal–melt partition coefficients from elastic moduli. Nature 372, 452–454). Comparison, at constant pressure, between hydrous and anhydrous values of the strain-free partition coefficient (D0) for the large cation sites of garnet and clinopyroxene reveals the relative importance of temperature and melt water content on partitioning. In the case of garnet, the effect of lower temperature, which serves to increase D0, and higher water content, which serves to decrease D0, counteract each other to the extent that water has little effect on garnet–melt D0 values. In contrast, the effect of water on clinopyroxene–melt D0 overwhelms the effect of temperature, such that D0 is significantly lower under hydrous conditions. For both minerals, however, the lower temperature of the hydrous experiments tends to tighten the partitioning parabolas, increasing fractionation of light from heavy REE compared to anhydrous experiments. Three sets of near-liquidus clinopyroxene–garnet two-mineral D values increase the range of published experimental determinations, but show significant differences from natural two-mineral D's determined for subsolidus mineral pairs. Similar behaviour is observed for the first experimental data for orthopyroxene–clinopyroxene two-mineral D's when compared with natural data. These differences are in large part of a consequence of the subsolidus equilibration temperatures and compositions of natural mineral pairs. Great care should therefore be taken when using natural mineral–mineral partition coefficients to interpret magmatic processes. The new data for strongly hydrous compositions suggest that fractionation of Zr–Hf–Sm by garnet decreases with increasing depth. Thus, melts leaving a garnet-dominated residuum at depths of about 200 km or greater may preserve source Zr/Hf and Hf/Sm. This contrasts with melting at shallower depths where both garnet and clinopyroxene will cause Zr–Hf–Sm fractionation. Also, at shallower depths, clinopyroxene-dominated fractionation may produce a positive Sr spike in melts from spinel lherzolite, but for garnet lherzolite melting, no Sr spike will result. Conversely, clinopyroxene megacrysts with negative Sr spikes may crystallize from magmas without anomalous Sr contents when plotted on mantle compatibility diagrams. Because the characteristics of strongly hydrous silicate melt and solute-rich aqueous fluid converge at high pressure, the hydrous data presented here are particularly pertinent to modelling processes in subduction zones, where aqueous fluids may have an important metasomatic role.},

Despite the paucity of samples with intermediate composition between the two main types of lava (only one phonotephrite flow is reported in this area), whole-rock major element modelling shows that the two main lithologies can be linked by fractional crystallization. The most primitive modelled cumulates are calcite-bearing olivine clinopyroxenites, whereas the final stages of differentiation are characterized by the formation of nepheline-syenite cumulates. This evolution trend is classically observed in plutonic alkaline massifs associated with carbonatites. Late-stage evolution is responsible for the crystallization of hainite- and delhayelite-bearing microdomains, for the transformation of aegirine-augite into aegirine (or augite into aegirine-augite), and for the crystallization of lorenzenite and a eudialyte-group mineral as replacement products of titanite. These phases were probably formed, either by crystallization from late residual peralkaline melts, or by reaction of pre-existing minerals with such melt, or hydrothermal peralkaline fluid. ¬{\textcopyright} 2009 The Mineralogical Society.},

abstract = {Two characteristics of peralkaline igneous rocks that are poorly understood are the extreme enrichment in HFSE, notably Zr, Nb, Y and REE, and the occurrence of fluid inclusions dominated by methane and higher hydrocarbons. Although much of the HFSE enrichment can be explained by magmatic processes, the common intense alteration of the parts of the peralkaline intrusions most enriched in these elements suggests that hydrothermal processes also play an important role in HFSE enrichment. Likewise, although the origin of the higher order hydrocarbons that occur as inclusions in these rocks is still debated, there is strong evidence that at least in some cases their formation involved hydrothermal processes. The issues of HFSE enrichment and hydrocarbon formation in peralkaline intrusions are examined using data from the Strange Lake pluton, a small, middle-Proterozoic intrusion of peralkaline granite in northeast Canada. This pluton contains some of the highest concentrations of Zr, REE and Y ever reported in an igneous body, and is characterised by abundant hydrocarbon-dominated fluid inclusions in rocks that have been hydrothermally altered, including those that form a potential HFSE ore zone. We show that HFSE at Strange Lake were partly concentrated to near exploitable levels as a result of their transport in a high salinity magmatic aqueous liquid, and that this fluid coexisted immiscibly with a carbonic phase which reacted with hydrogen and iron oxides generated during the associated hydrothermal alteration to produce hydrocarbons via a Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. As a result, hydrocarbons and HFSE mineralization are intimately associated. We then go on to show that hydrothermal alteration, HFSE mineralisation and hydrocarbons are also spatially associated in other peralkaline complexes, and present a model to explain this association, which we believe may be applicable to any peralkaline intrusion where HFSE enrichment was accompanied by calcium metasomatism, hematisation and hydrothermal fluorite. We also suggest that, even where these criteria are not satisfied, hydrothermally enriched HFSE and hydrocarbons will be intimately associated simply because they are products of the same initial magmatic fluid. Finally, we speculate that the association of HFSE and hydrocarbons may in some cases actually be genetic, if, as seems possible, unmixing or effervescence of a reduced carbonic fluid from the original magmatic fluid caused changes in temperature, pH, fO2 or the activity of volatile ligands sufficient to induce the deposition of HFSE minerals.},

abstract = {Olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt rare-earth element (REE) partition coefficients consistent with clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients were determined indirectly from subsolidus partitioning between olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene after suitable correction for temperature. Heavy- and middle-REE ratios for olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene pairs correlate negatively with effective cationic radius, whereas those for the light REEs correlate positively with cationic radius, generating a U-shaped pattern in apparent mineral/clinopyroxene partition coefficients versus cationic radius. Lattice strain models of partitioning modified for subsolidus conditions yield negative correlations of olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene with respect to cationic radii, predicting well the measured partitioning behaviors of the heavy and middle REEs but not that of the light REEs. The light-REE systematics cannot be explained with lattice strain theory and, instead, can be explained by disequilibrium enrichment of the light REEs in melt inclusions or on the rims of olivine and orthopyroxene. Realistic light-REE partition coefficients were thus extrapolated from the measured heavy- and middle-REE partition coefficients using the lattice strain model. Light REE olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients calculated in this manner are lower than most published values, but agree reasonably well with partitioning experiments using the most recent in situ analytical techniques (secondary-ionization mass spectrometry and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). These new olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients are useful for accurate modeling of the REE contents of clinopyroxene-poor to -free lithologies, such as harzburgitic residues of melting. Finally, the application of the lattice strain theory to subsolidus conditions represents a framework for assessing the degree of REE disequilibrium in a rock. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Middlemost1972,
abstract = {La Palma is the northwestern island in the Canary archipelago. The island is volcanically active and in recent years there have been two eruptions (1949 and 1971). The oldest rocks that crop out on the island are altered spilitic lavas and they are intruded by numerous dykes and a number of mafic and ultramafic plutonic rocks. These rocks form part of the floor of the huge Caldera de Taburiente. In the walls of the Caldera one finds a 1000 metres thick unit that is composed of lavas and tephra. The rocks are called the El Time formation; and they together with the rocks of the Cumbre Vieja ridge are mainly composed of accumulative mafic rocks, basanites, hawaiites, benmoreites and phonolitic trachytes. These sodarich alkalic rocks are considered to have evolved by fractional crystallization of a basanitic magma in a near surface environment. It is proposed that La Palma developed on a relatively cold section of a plate of oceanic lithosphere that was over 100 m.y. old. During the Alpine-Atlas orogeny this section of the African plate was disrupted and a basanitic magma was extruded onto the sea floor. The volcanic focus of this eruption became established as a local centre for the degassing of the mantle and as a result this area has experienced a long series of eruptions. During the first phase in the evolution of La Palma the submarine edifice of the island was constructed and the rocks of the Caldera Floor formation were emplaced. After a period of marine erosion the huge old volcano Taburiente developed in the northern half of the island. During the final phase in the evolution of the island the southern section of the volcanic edifice subsided and formed the El Paso tectonic basin and the volcanic rift zone along which the many smaller volcanoes of the Cumbre Vieja ridge have developed.},

abstract = {A quantitative understanding of crystallization and solidification is central to appreciatinga variety of phenomena at the interface between volcanology and petrology. Interpretation of magmatic processes from the textures of erupted lavas and pyroclasts in turn depends uponunderstanding how textures evolve during cooling, decompression, and devolatilization. Crystalsize, shape, and compositional distribution depend upon the underlying phase equilibria, masstransport processes, and kinetics of reactions at interfaces. Applications of kinetics in physicalvolcanology include estimating intra-eruptive magma residence times using crystal growthrates (e.g., Mangan 1990); interpreting perturbations in the melt composition or thermal statefrom microtextures (e.g., Sharp et al. 1996); assessing degassing as a driver of crystal growth(e.g., Blundy and Cashman 2001) and microlite nucleation (e.g., Hammer et al. 1999) duringvolcanic eruptions; and interpreting magmatic conditions as they change through time usingcrystal population trends (e.g., zieg and Marsh 2002). This contribution is chiefly concerned with magmas out of chemical and textural equilibriumevolving due to changes in temperature, pressure, or composition. However, studies concernedwith dynamic aspects of syn-eruptive magma evolution are predicated on an understandingof the equilibrium steady-state, with experiments typically incorporating an initial stage ofequilibration, imposing magma reservoir conditions as a prelude to controlled cooling ordecompression. This review likewise includes a brief overview of the phase equilibria approachfor determining the “initial conditions” for volcanic eruptions. The remainder of the chapterconsiders kinetic aspects of crystallization, which are essential for interpreting the informationencoded in the compositions and textures of volcanic materials. A section each is allottedto (1) presenting concepts and controversies in the theoretical understanding of kinetics ofcrystallization since the last RIMG review on this topic (Kirkpatrick 1981), (2) summarizinggeneric aspects of experimental methods and experiment design in geological studies, (2)reviewing established trends in basalt crystallization, highlighting recent studies that buildupon these relationships, and examining pioneering research in olivine growth kinetics andmelt inclusion entrapment, (3) considering constraints on kinetics of crystallization in hydrousfelsic magmas due to decompression and devolatilization, (4) discussing conventional andinnovative methods of characterizing crystal textures of experimental run products, (5) assessingthe effects of phase interactions including epitaxial growth and heterogeneous nucleation, and(6) describing frontier research on compositional aspects of the melt inclusion entrapmentprocess incorporating energetic and kinetic issues presented in the previous sections.},

abstract = {Platinum-group elements (PGEs) are one of the key tracers to reveal early differentiation processes of the Earth due to their preferential distribution into the metallic core. Meanwhile, informative evidence for early differentiation has been greatly disturbed through metasomatic PGE disturbance, which has been demonstrated through a number of PGE data for natural mantle peridotites as well as base-metal sulfide and platinum group mineral grains therein. The mechanism and process of metasomatic PGE mobilization should be investigated in detail for an appropriate estimation of PGE abundance in the primitive upper mantle. However, this has not yet been achieved, because sub-micrometer-scale (i.e. scale of less than a micrometer) descriptions for metasomatic effects imprinted in the mantle peridotites have not been sufficiently recorded. Here, we report a sub-micrometer-sized sulfide–glass inclusion array in a Tahitian harzburgite xenolith. The textural and chemical characteristics were disclosed with employing synchrotron X-ray and transmission electron microscope analyses. The results demonstrate that the sulfide and glass contain appreciable amounts of PGE (9.7 at.{\%} Ir, 4.3 at.{\%} Rh and 5.8 at.{\%} Pt) and carbon (21.2 at.{\%} C), respectively. The sulfide–glass inclusion array is hosted in sodium-enriched clinopyroxene (up to 1.8 wt{\%} Na2O) that shows vein-like distribution and partly replaces orthopyroxene. Primitive mantle-normalized trace-element patterns of the clinopyroxene show a general increase from heavy rare-earth elements (REEs) to light REEs with negative anomalies in Pb and high-field-strength elements such as Zr, Hf and Ti, which indicate equilibration with Mg-rich carbonatitic melt. These results suggest that Na-bearing Mg-rich carbonatitic melts were involved in the harzburgite formation and that Ir, Rh and Pt were mobilized through carbonatitic metasomatism and eventually distributed in the sulfides.},

abstract = {We report the first 39Ar–40Ar ages from the three early basic shield-like massifs of Tenerife, Canary islands, and couple these with detailed major and trace element chemistry to constrain the nature and timing of the mantle melting processes. The massifs have chemically different sources, and independent evolutionary histories. The Teno and Roque del Conde massifs appear chemically to represent the products of single mantle melting cycles, with progressive decrease in mean melt fraction and increase in mean melting depth in younger rocks. The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0–6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar–40Ar ages ranging from 8.0–4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599–626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6–7{\%}. The fractionation sequence is olivine–clinopyroxene–magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Martı́, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089–1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction.},

abstract = {Investigations of a variety of continental rifts and margins worldwide have revealed that a considerable volume of melt can intrude into the crust during continental breakup, modifying its composition and thermal structure. However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning. Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin.},

abstract = {The results of new field observations, 23 new KAr determinations and sixteen previously published determinations provide the basis for the reconstruction of the subaerial volcanic history of the island of La Palma, after the seamount activity represented by the materials of the Basal Complex. An eruptive phase between 2.0 and 1.3 Ma formed a large shield. A period of volcanic quiescence followed, until around 1 Ma, during which a large lateral collapse partly destroyed the former edifice. Between 1.05 and 0.7 Ma, activity was renewed in the shield and a N-S ridge was built in the southern part of the island. Around 0.7 Ma, two new large lateral collapses affected the western part of both edifices, and they were followed by eruptions between 0.71 and 0.65 Ma which built a new edifice that partly filled the depressions thus created. The Caldera de Taburiente constitutes the eroded remnants of the depression formed in the northern shield. From 0.65 Ma to present, activity has been restricted to the N-S ridge, which has continued to grow southwards. There was a general N-S migration of volcanic activity with time, but in the shield the trend was northwest to southeast. Eruptive rates seem to have been fairly constant during the different eruptive phases considered, between 0.15 and 0.37 km3/ka. A very similar succession of constructive and destructive episodes has been obtained for the neighboring island of Hierro, but in this case the activity started around 0.8 Ma and eruptive rates were about 0.5 km3/ka.},

abstract = {Paleoproterozoic eclogite xenoliths from the Jericho and Muskox kimberlites located in the northern Slave craton, Canada, display geochemical and isotopic evidence of a recycled oceanic lithosphere origin. The eclogites comprise a diverse suite of kyanite- and diamond-bearing and bimineralic xenoliths that have a wide range of geochemical compositions. Calculated whole-rock eclogite compositions are broadly basaltic to picritic, ranging from 5 to 13 wt {\%} MgO. Calculated whole-rock trace-element compositions for the eclogites show three overall REE patterns: the first pattern resembles that of oceanic gabbros with prominent positive Eu anomalies and flat heavy REE; the second pattern is similar to the first but displays marked light REE depletion that is interpreted to record partial melt loss; the third pattern lacks Eu anomalies and instead displays both gradually increasing REE contents from La to Lu similar to boninitic melts and ‘humped' middle REE patterns similar to those observed in eclogites formed by reaction with subduction fluids. Several eclogites have garnet and/or clinopyroxene $\delta$18O values {\textgreater}6‰, which coupled with the trace-element systematics of all the eclogites is interpreted to reflect derivation from recycled oceanic lithosphere protoliths. Lead isotope data for eclogite clinopyroxenes form a broad array that extends from highly radiogenic isotope compositions similar to the host Jericho kimberlite to an intersection with the Stacey–Kramers terrestrial two-stage Pb evolution curve at c. 2{\textperiodcentered}2 Ga. The slope of this data array defines a secondary Pb isochron with an associated age of 1{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}3 Ga. Although it is possible that the Pb isotope array is actually a mixing line between the eclogite protolith and the host Jericho kimberlite, both the secondary isochron age and the c. 2{\textperiodcentered}2 Ga Stacey–Kramers model age are consistent with Paleoproterozoic protolith oceanic crust formation. Eclogite xenoliths and eclogitic diamond inclusions from the Slave craton almost exclusively yield c. 2 Ga ages, which are broadly compatible with formation during subduction associated with the c. 1{\textperiodcentered}9–1{\textperiodcentered}8 Ga Wopmay orogeny at the western margin of the Slave craton. Trends in the Sr–Pb isotopic compositions of the eclogite clinopyroxene show that seawater alteration of the oceanic crust protoliths was an important process during protolith formation, and cryptic metasomatism further increased the Pb and Sr isotope values. This metasomatism is probably associated with the Jurassic kimberlite magmatism; however, contributions from the Mesoproterozoic Mackenzie event cannot be completely excluded.},

abstract = {The origin of felsic magmas ({\textgreater}63{\%} SiO2) in intra-oceanic arc settings is still a matter of debate. Two very different processes are currently invoked to explain their origin. These include fractional crystallization of basaltic magma and partial melting of lower crustal amphibolite. Because both fractionation and melting can lead to similar major element, trace element and isotopic characteristics in felsic magmas, such lines of evidence have been generally unsuccessful in discriminating between the two processes. A commonly under-appreciated aspect of rare earth element (REE) solid–liquid partitioning behavior is that D REE for most common igneous minerals (especially hornblende) increase significantly with increasing liquid SiO2 contents. For some minerals (e.g., hornblende and augite), REE partitioning can change from incomptatible (D {\textless} 1) at low liquid SiO2 to compatible (D {\textgreater} 1) at high liquid SiO2. When this behavior is incorporated into carefully constrained mass-balance models for mafic (basaltic) amphibolite melting, intermediate (andesitic) amphibolite melting, lower or mid to upper crustal hornblende-present basalt fractionation, and mid to upper crustal hornblende-absent basalt fractionation the following general predictions emerge for felsic magmas (e.g., ∼63 to 76{\%} SiO2). Partial melting of either mafic or intermediate amphibolite should, regardless of the type of melting (equilibrium, fractional, accumulated fractional) yield REE abundances that remain essentially constant and then decrease, or steadily decrease with increasing liquid SiO2 content. At high liquid SiO2 contents LREE abundances should be slightly enriched to slightly depleted (i.e., C l/C o ∼ 2 to 0.2) while HREE abundances should be slightly depleted (C l/C o ∼ 1 to 0.2). Lower crustal hornblende-bearing basalt fractionation should yield roughly constant REE abundances with increasing liquid SiO2 and exhibit only slight enrichment (C l/C o ∼ 1.2). Mid to upper crustal hornblende-bearing basalt fractionation should yield steadily increasing LREE abundances but constant and then decreasing HREE abundances. At high liquid SiO2 contents LREE abundances may range from non-enriched to highly enriched (C l/C o ∼ 1 to 5) while HREE abundances are generally non-enriched to only slightly enriched (C l/C o ∼ 1 to 2). Hornblende-absent basalt fractionation should yield steadily increasing REE abundances with increasing liquid SiO2 contents. At high SiO2 contents both LREE and HREE are highly enriched (C l/C o ∼ 3 to 4). It is proposed that these model predictions constitute a viable test for determining a fractionation or amphibolite melting origin for felsic magmas in intra-oceanic arc environments where continental crust is absent.},

abstract = {Fifty-six new oxygen isotope analyses of minerals separated from nine Mesozoic anorogenic complexes of Damaraland in northwest Namibia have been used to estimate the $\delta$18O values of the original magmas ($\delta$magma). These complexes range in composition from nepheline syenite to alkaline and peraluminous granites, often with a variety of rock types present at a single centre. The silica-undersaturated rock types show a relatively small spread of values of $\delta$magma from 6.0 to 7.0‰ (mean 6.6‰), which is consistent with their derivation from the mantle with little or no subsequent crustal contamination. The silica-oversaturated rocks show a wide range of $\delta$magma values from 4.9 to 12.0‰, with a mean value of 8.3‰. The high values of $\delta$magma in the silica-oversaturated rocks can only be explained with considerable involvement of the continental crust in their petrogenesis, and those rocks with $\delta$magma{\textgreater}10‰ are interpreted as essentially crustal melts. It is generally accepted that the Damaraland complexes were generated as a result of rifting across the Tristan plume, with the plume providing both mantle-derived magma and with it the heat required for crustal melting. In addition to their mantle-like oxygen isotope ratios, the undersaturated rocks of the Damaraland complexes possess the trace element characteristics (e.g. low Zr/Nb ratios) of ocean island basalt, suggesting that their parental magmas were produced from the plume itself. In contrast, the oversaturated complexes generally have higher Zr/Nb ratios that are consistent with a larger crustal input. The highest values of $\delta$magma in the Damaraland complexes are found in granitic rocks that intrude the central zone of the Pan-African Damara Orogen where presumably there is a substantial component of sedimentary origin in the lower to middle crust.},

abstract = {Ore genesis, when associated with felsic magmatism, develops from metals scavenging from the melt into the fluid, gaseous, phase. Its composition includes water, CO2, sulphur under several possible species, and halogens, mainly F and Cl. The respective influence of those elements is examined by computing the theoretical electronegativity and chemical hardness of the fluid phase. Those parameters are commonly larger for the fluid phase than for the silicate melt. Indeed a common hardness value for the melt is around 3.5 eV, whereas the computed values for the fluid phase are around 7.5 eV for pure water, with departure ranging from 6.9 eV in case of S-rich fluid, to 8.8 eV in case of a F-rich fluid. Since metals show tendency to present electronegativity above 15 eV and high hardness, the fluid phase is very attractive for metals. The influence of S, under its various non-detailed species, is to decrease both electronegativity and hardness. It therefore favours segregation of soft metals, as Cu, Ag and Au. Since F-is the hardest base, it increases both electronegativity and hardness, making the fluid phase attractive to Sn and W. Cl-presents contrasted effects, since it decreases the hardness, but increases the electronegativity. It could be of influence in the segregation of Fe in iron-oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) porphyry deposits, though mixing between magmatic and evaporitic fluids makes the situation quite complex. The chemical character of the fluid phase also explains the discrepancy existing for metal solubility, as well as for the redox conditions, between the melt and the fluid phase. The change in oxidation state induced by a hard fluid, i.e. F-rich, promotes oxidation, for instance from Sn(II) to Sn(IV) or reduction in case of a soft, i.e. S-rich, fluid phase, from Mo(VI) to Mo(IV). The bulk electronegativity and hardness of the fluid phase modify the redox state of the metals during transportation, before condensation. The semi-quantitative model provides a new insight on the chemical conditions of metals segregation and transportation through the magma before ore formation. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Peridotitic mantle xenoliths from historic and prehistoric eruptions on La Palma show many similarities. Prolonged reactions of the xenoliths with their host magmas have been used to place constraints on the magma transport system beneath the island. All xenoliths show crystalline selvages and 0.9–2.6 mm wide diffusion zones in olivine along most of their surface. Diffusion kinetics in olivine, combined with fluid inclusion barometry, document that selvages and diffusion zones formed at crustal levels within 8 to about 100 years. Some xenolith fractures lack selvages and were in contact with the host magma for less than 4 days. A multistage magma ascent is proposed: (i) peridotite wall rock was fragmented and became incorporated into the ascending magma years to decades prior to the eruption; (ii) the xenoliths were rapidly transported to, and deposited in, crustal magma reservoirs, forming selvages and diffusion zones at the xenolith rims; (iii) renewed fragmentation of the xenoliths occurred days to hours prior to eruption, possibly by decompressive strain fracturing during rapid ascent.},

abstract = {Mineral exploration comprises three sequential steps: development of a business strategy, creation and application of a targeting model, and follow-up with direct detection in defined high-priority domains. The main geoscientific challenge is the conceptual targeting phase which can lower geological risk and ensure cost-effective direct-detection exploration. A fundamental tenet of conceptual targeting is that ore deposits are part of much more extensive systems, and hence that targeting must be carried out at global through province to district scales. The heterogeneous distribution of ore deposits and their power-law size frequency distribution in individual provinces leads to alternative 'Elephant Country' and 'First Mover' strategies, both of which employ conceptual targeting, but at different scales. The first stage of targeting science involves development of robust, multi-scale targeting models for ore-deposit types, particularly larger examples. The targeting models can then be applied to identify specific targets by interrogating databases compiled as layers of spatially referenced key themes or parameters. At larger scales in immature terrains, a Hierarchical approach is commonly used to progressively reduce terrains and identify targets, whereas a Venn-diagram approach, the basis of most GIS-based prospectivity analyses, is more commonly used in mature terrains where spatial databases are of higher, more homogenous quality. Target ranking is best achieved using a multiplicative probability approach in which it is required that all essential processes in a mineral system must have operated to form a significant ore deposit. In practice, one or more critical spatially referenced parameters are used as proxies for the essential processes to develop a target score, which is a semi-quantitative estimate of probability of the presence of a large ore deposit. Such target ranking can be used in both proactive ground acquisition and reactive submittal-based project acquisition. Once targets have been defined and explored, it is important that there is critical feedback on the robustness of the targeting exercise such that new information is used to build superior databases and/or targeting models for future area-selection programs.},

abstract = {The accreted Wrangellia flood basalts and associated sedimentary rocks that compose the prevolcanic and postvolcanic stratigraphy provide an unparalleled view of the architecture, eruptive environment, and accumulation and subsidence history of an oceanic plateau. This Triassic large igneous province extends for similar to 2300 km in the Pacific Northwest of North America, from central Alaska and western Yukon (Nikolai Formation) to Vancouver Island (Karmutsen Formation), and contains exposures of submarine and subaerial volcanic rocks representing composite stratigraphic thicknesses of 3.5-6 km. Here we provide a model for the construction of the Wrangellia oceanic plateau using the following information and visualization tools: (1) stratigraphic summaries for different areas of Wrangellia; (2) new 40Ar/39Ar geochronology results; (3) compilation and assessment of geochronology and biostratigraphy for Wrangellia; (4) compiled digital geologic maps; (5) an online photographic archive of field relationships; and (6) a Google Earth file showing the mapped extent of Wrangellia flood basalts and linked field photographs. Based on combined radiometric (U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, K-Ar), paleontological, and magnetostratigraphic age constraints, the Wrangellia flood basalts were emplaced during a single phase of tholeiitic volcanism ca. 230-225 Ma, and possibly within as few as 2 Myr, onto preexisting submerged arc crust. There are distinct differences in volcanic stratigraphy and basement composition between Northern and Southern Wrangellia. On Vancouver Island, similar to 6 km of high-Ti basalts, with minor amounts of picrites, record an emergent sequence of pillow basalt, pillow breccia and hyaloclastite, and subaerial flows that overlie Devonian-Mississippian (ca. 380-355 Ma) island arc rocks and Mississippian-Permian marine sedimentary strata. In contrast, Alaska and Yukon contain 1-3.5-km-thick sequences of mostly subaerial high-Ti basalt flows, with low-Ti basalt and submarine pillow basalts in the lowest parts of the stratigraphy, that overlie Pennsylvanian-Permian (312-280 Ma) volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Subsidence of the entire plateau occurred during and after volcanism, based on late-stage interflow sedimentary lenses in the upper stratigraphic levels and the presence of hundreds of meters to {\textgreater}1000 m of overlying marine sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. The main factors that controlled the resulting volcanic architecture of the Wrangellia oceanic plateau include high effusion rates and the formation of extensive compound flow fields from low-viscosity, high-temperature tholeiitic basalts, sill-dominated feeder systems, limited repose time between flows (absence of weathering, erosion, sedimentation), submarine versus subaerial emplacement, and relative water depth (e. g., pillow basalt-volcaniclastic transition).},

This peak is shifted to higher frequency and becomes more symmetric with the addition of 0.3 wt{\%} Cl. Deconvolution of the high-frequency waveband indicates differences between spectra are the result of a contribution from a peak at 945 cm−1 resulting from Ti–O vibrations in fully polymerized titanate tetrahedra. It is proposed that addition of Cl destabilizes [5]Ti in favor of tetrahedral coordination as a result of competition between Cl and titanate groups for alkalis.

abstract = {We have determined the partitioning of a wide range of trace elements between silicate melts and CaSiO3 and MgSiO3 perovskites using both laser ablation-ICPMS and ion microprobe techniques. Our results show that, with the exception of Sc, Zr, and Hf, all trace elements we considered are incompatible in MgSiO3 perovskite, from highly incompatible for U, Th, Ba, La, Sr and monovalent elements to slightly incompatible for heavy rare earth elements. MgSiO3 perovskite-melt partition coefficients increase slightly with Al content in the perovskite. These observations contrast strongly with partitioning between CaSiO3 perovskite and silicate melts. In the latter case, all rare earth elements are clearly compatible as are U and Th. Our data also suggest that, contrary to pressure and temperature, melt composition can significantly affect CaSiO3 perovskite-melt partitioning; partition coefficients for rare earth elements and U and Th increase with decreasing CaO melt content. The presence of ∼0.4 wt{\%} water in melt makes little difference, however. Partitioning of trace elements into the large site of both MgSiO3 and CaSiO3 perovskites follows the near-parabolic dependence on ionic radius predicted from the lattice strain model. The peaks of the parabolae are much higher for the CaSiO3 phase, perhaps suggesting that the mechanisms of charge compensation for heterovalent substitution are different in the two cases. Our partitioning data have been used to assess the potential effect of perovskite fractionation into the lower mantle during early Earth history. Crystallisation of less than 8{\%} of a mixture of CaSiO3 and MgSiO3 perovskites could have led to a ‘layer' enriched in U and Th without disturbing the chondritic pattern of refractory lithophile elements in the primitive upper mantle. The resultant reservoir could have high Sm/Nd, U/Pb, Sr/Rb, Lu/Hf ratios similar to the HIMU component of ocean island basalts, but would not balance the observed depletion of the primitive upper mantle in Si and Nb.},

abstract = {Clinopyroxene–melt trace element partitioning experiments were carried out in the system Na2O–CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 at pressures of 1, 2.3 and 3 GPa and temperatures of 1508 to 1811 K, to investigate the effects of temperature (T), pressure (P) and composition (X) on partition coefficients. Of particular interest were elements entering the octahedral M1-site. Ion probe analyses of run products produced crystal–melt partition coefficients (D) for 16 elements (Na, Ca, Al, Cl, Sc, Ti, Fe, Zr, In, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Ho, Yb and Hf). With the exception of D  Na, partition coefficients for all elements studied decrease with increased P and T, despite the concomitant increase in the Al content of the T-site. Fitting partition coefficients for isovalent series of cations to the elastic strain model of Blundy and Wood (1994) produced values for the site radius (r  0), effective elastic modulus (E) and strain-free partition coefficient (D  0). At each pressure, E values for the M1 and M2-sites increase with increasing Al concentration in the T-site {\$}{\$} $\backslash$left( {\{}X{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Al{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}T{\}} {\}} $\backslash$right) {\$}{\$}. For a given bulk composition, E values decrease with increased T. The decrease in E with increasing T accounts for the remarkable constancy of the degree of fractionation between chemically similar elements, e.g. {\$}{\$} D$\backslash$left( {\{}{\{}$\backslash$frac{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Zr{\}}{\}}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Hf{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}} $\backslash$right) {\$}{\$}, over the range of pressures studied here. {\$}{\$} E{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}M{\}}{\}}1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}4 + {\}} {\$}{\$} for our experiments is found to be higher than predicted by the Hazen and Finger (1979) relationship between elastic moduli and interatomic distance. This is explained by deformation of the M1-site polyhedron leading to relative displacement and kinking of the clinopyroxene T-site chains. We developed expressions for {\$}{\$} E{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}M{\}}{\}}1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}4 + {\}} {\$}{\$}, {\$}{\$} r{\_}{\{}{\{}0,{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}M{\}}{\}}1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}4 + {\}} {\$}{\$}, D  Sc and D  Ti as functions of P, T and composition. We show the feasibility of using calculated D  Ti values in the prediction of D  Zr and D  Hf. Scandium and Ti partition coefficients were modelled based on the thermodynamic description for the crystal–melt exchange reaction and in terms of the energetics of the different charge-imbalanced configurations produced by insertion of a heterovalent trace cation. The resulting equations produce values of D  Sc and D  Ti that are within a factor of 2 of other experimentally determined values. Fits of the equations along the lherzolite solidus show that D  Sc remains compatible in clinopyroxene at high pressure and that ratios of Zr/Hf and Ti/Eu should vary subtly with the pressure at which melting occurred. },

abstract = {Fluorine and chlorine diffusion were measured in two natural phonolitic melts, from Vesuvius (Italy) and from Laacher See (Germany), at 0.5 and 1.0 GPa, between 1250 and 1450 °C at anhydrous conditions and with about 2 and 5 wt.{\%} of dissolved water. The two different starting materials allow us to investigate the alkali effect, Na vs. K, on halogen diffusion. One composition was a K-rich ({\~{}} 10 wt.{\%}) phonolitic melt corresponding to the white pumice phase of the 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius, and the other a Na-rich ({\~{}} 10 wt.{\%}) phonolitic melt corresponding to most differentiated melt of the 12,000 BC eruption of Laacher See. The diffusion-couple technique in a piston cylinder was used for the experiments. Experiments were performed with only one halogen diffusing and with the simultaneous diffusion of a halogen mixture (F, Cl, Br) in order to evaluate the interactions between the halogens during diffusion. Diffusion coefficients for F range between 2 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1250 °C and 7 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1450 °C for the Na-rich melt and between 1 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1250 °C and 8 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1450 °C for the K-rich melt at anhydrous conditions. Diffusion coefficients for Cl range between 2 × 10− 12 m2/s at 1250 °C and 1 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1450 °C for the Na-rich melt and between 7 × 10− 12 m2/s at 1250 °C and 2 × 10− 11 m2/s at 1450 °C for the K-rich melt at anhydrous conditions. Fluorine diffusivity is higher than Cl in the Na-rich-phonolitic melt by one order of magnitude, whereas in the K-rich-phonolitic melt F and Cl diffusivities are similar. The effect of water is significant for Cl in both Na-rich and K-rich melts: the addition of water enhances Cl diffusivity by up to one order of magnitude, but water does not significantly affect F diffusion. F and Cl diffusivities always differ from one another in the same phonolitic melt composition. F diffusivities are similar in both compositions. Conversely, Cl diffusion depends upon the dominant alkali. These results evidence that halogen diffusivity may represent a limiting factor for their degassing during rapid syneruptive decompression and vesiculation of H2O-rich-phonolitic melts. The contrasting volatile diffusivities of F and Cl in silicate melts during magma vesiculation may be a key, controlling factor of the composition of the vapour phase (bubbles) produced. Such diffusion controlled degassing model may explain the absence of F and Cl degassing observed during the 79AD eruption of Vesuvius.},

abstract = {The Lofdal Intrusive Suite, Namibia, consists of calcio-carbonatite and silica-undersaturated alkaline intrusive rocks ranging in composition from phono-tephrite to phonolite (and nepheline syenite). The most primitive of these rocks is the phono-tephrite, which, on the basis of its Y/Ho and Nb/Ta ratios, is interpreted to have formed by partial melting of the mantle. Roughly linear trends in major and trace element contents from phono-tephrite to phonolite and nepheline syenite indicate that the latter two rock types evolved from the phono-tephrite by fractional crystallisation. The nepheline syenite, however, has a lower rare earth element (REE) content than the phonolite. The carbonatite has a primitive mantle-normalised REE profile roughly parallel to that of the silica-undersaturated alkaline igneous rocks, although the absolute REE concentrations are higher. Like the phono-tephrite, it also has a mantle Y/Ho ratio. However, the Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios are significantly higher. Moreover, the carbonatite displays strong negative Ta, Zr and Hf anomalies on spidergrams, whereas the silicate rocks display positive anomalies for these elements. Significantly, this behaviour is predicted by the corresponding carbonatite-silicate melt partition coefficients, as is the behaviour of the REE. Based on these observations, we interpret the carbonatite to represent an immiscible liquid that exsolved from the phono-tephrite or possibly the phonolite melt. The result was a calcio-carbonatite that is enriched in the heavy REE (HREE) relative to most other carbonatites. Fluids released from the corresponding magma are interpreted to have been the source of the REE mineralisation that is currently the target of exploration.},

abstract = {Climate and carbon cycle are tightly coupled on many timescales, from interannual to multi-millennial timescales. Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Ni{\~{n}}o years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change.},

In this note, I argue that neither outcome is likely given realistically diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Instead—all else equal—more capital will erode the economywide return on capital. When converted from gross to net terms, standard empirical estimates of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor are well below those assumed in Capital. Piketty (2014)'s inference of a high elasticity from time series is unsound, assuming a constant real price of capital despite the dominant role of rising prices in pushing up the capital/income ratio. Recent trends in both capital wealth and income are driven almost entirely by housing, with underlying mechanisms quite different from those emphasized in Capital.},

abstract = {Field, geochronological and geophysical studies show that many igneous bodies are emplaced incrementally, growing by accretion of successive magma sheets. The existence of melt reservoirs with a size that exceeds one single increment strongly depends on the sheet emplacement rate, whereas the total volumes of magma that accumulate depend on the volumetric magma flux. Integration of geochronological and field data with numerical simulations suggeststhat those rates can vary dramatically over the growth of an igneous body and that magmas accumulate to form melt-rich magma chambers only during episodes of high magma flux.Heat and mass balance considerations and the large volumes of mafic magma required to generate differentiated melts suggest that most crustal differentiation happens in deep hot zones in the lower crust wherein a wide diversity of melts are produced by crystallisation of mafic parents and concomitant partial melting of the crust. Melt composition is further modified during migration, segregation and ascent, and intermediate compositions can be generated when different types of melt mix. Magma fluxes and intrusion geometry play a fundamental role in igneous body evolution. Thus our knowledge of igneous processes depends ultimately on our understanding of the physics that control magma fluxes into the crust, magma emplacement within the crust and magma migration through the crust.},

abstract = {The published mean $\delta$34S values of ore-related pyrites from orogenic gold deposits of the Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Craton lie between −4‰ and +4‰. As for orogenic gold deposits worldwide, most deposits have positive means and a restricted range of $\delta$34S values, but some have negative means and wider ranges of $\delta$34S values. Wall-rock carbonation and back-mixing of similar-source fluids with different fluid pathways can explain some of the more negative $\delta$34S signatures. However, structural setting appears to be the most important factor controlling ore-fluid oxidation state and hence the distribution of $\delta$34S values in gold-related pyrites. Shear-hosted deposits appear to have experienced fluid-dominated processes such as phase separation, whereas stockwork, vein-hosted or disseminated deposits formed under conditions of greater rock buffering. At Victory-Defiance, in particular, negative $\delta$34S values are more common in gently dipping dilational structures, compared to more compressional steeply dipping structures. It appears most likely that fluid-pressure fluctuations during fault-valve cycles establish different fluid-flow regimes in structures with different orientations. Rapid fluid-pressure fluctuations in dilational structures during seismic activity can cause partitioning of reduced gas phases from the ore fluid during extreme phase separation and hence are an effective method of ore-fluid oxidation, leading to large, local fluctuations in oxidation state. It is thus not necessary to invoke mixing with oxidised magmatic fluids to explain $\delta$34S signatures indicative of oxidation. In any case, available, robust geochronology in the Eastern Goldfields Province does not support the direct involvement of oxidised magmatic fluids from adjacent granitic intrusions in orogenic gold genesis. Thus, negative mean $\delta$34S values and large variations in $\delta$34S values of ore-related pyrites in world-class orogenic gold deposits are interpreted to result from multiple mechanisms of gold precipitation from a single, ubiquitous ore fluid in varying structural settings, rather than from the involvement of oxidised ore fluids from a different source. Such signatures are indicative, but not diagnostic, of anomalously large orogenic gold systems.},

abstract = {A set of small volcanic edifices with tuff ring and maar morphologies occur in the Catanda area, which is the only locality with extrusive carbonatites reported in Angola. Four outcrops of carbonatite lavas have been identified in this region and considering the mineralogical, textural and compositional features, we classify them as: silicocarbonatites (1), calciocarbonatites (2) and secondary calciocarbonatites produced by the alteration of primary natrocarbonatites (3). Even with their differences, we interpret these lava types as having been a single carbonatite suite related to the same parental magma. We have also estimated the composition of the parental magma from a study of melt inclusions hosted in magnetite microphenocrysts from all of these lavas. Melt inclusions revealed the presence of 13 different alkali-rich phases (e.g., nyerereite, shortite, halite and sylvite) that argues for an alkaline composition of the Catanda parental melts. Mineralogical, textural, compositional and isotopic features of some Catanda lavas are also similar to those described in altered natrocarbonatite localities worldwide such as Tinderet or Kerimasi, leading to our conclusion that the formation of some Catanda calciocarbonatite lavas was related to the occurrence of natrocarbonatite volcanism in this area. On the other hand, silicocarbonatite lavas, which are enriched in periclase, present very different mineralogical, compositional and isotopic features in comparison to the rest of Catanda lavas. We conclude that its formation was probably related to the decarbonation of primary dolomite bearing carbonatites.},

abstract = {We investigate the crustal structure and tectonic evolution of the North American continent in Alaska, where the continent has grown through magmatism, accretion, and tectonic under-plating. In the 1980s and early 1990s, we conducted a geological and geophysical investigation, known as the Trans-Alaska Crustal Transect (TACT), along a 1350-km-long corridor from the Aleutian Trench to the Arctic coast. The most distinctive crustal structures and the deepest Moho along the transect are located near the Pacific and Arctic margins. Near the Pacific margin, we infer a stack of tectonically underplated oceanic layers interpreted as remnants of the extinct Kula (or Resurrection) plate. Continental Moho just north of this underplated stack is more than 55 km deep. Near the Arctic margin, the Brooks Range is underlain by large-scale duplex structures that overlie a tectonic wedge of North Slope crust and mantle. There, the Moho has been depressed to nearly 50 km depth. In contrast, the Moho of central Alaska is on average 32 km deep. In the Paleogene, tectonic underplating of Kula (or Resurrection) plate fragments overlapped in time with duplexing in the Brooks Range. Possible tectonic models linking these two regions include flat-slab subduction and an orogenic-float model. In the Neogene, the tectonics of the accreting Yakutat terrane have differed across a newly interpreted tear in the subducting Pacific oceanic lithosphere. East of the tear, Pacific oceanic lithosphere subducts steeply and alone beneath the Wrangell volcanoes, because the overlying Yakutat terrane has been left behind as underplated rocks beneath the rising St. Elias Range, in the coastal region. West of the tear, the Yakutat terrane and Pacific oceanic lithosphere subduct together at a gentle angle, and this thickened package inhibits volcanism.},

abstract = {The Amis Complex is a late intrusive phase associated with the Brandberg anorogenic granite intrusion. It consists of peralkaline, arfvedsonite-bearing granitic and pegmatitic dikes and sills and is characterized by locally extreme enrichments in REE and rare metals with high charge-ionic radius ratios, such as Zr and Nb. The highest concentrations (e.g., 1.7 wt {\%} Zr, 0.3 wt {\%} Nb, 0.5 wt {\%} total REE) are found in aegirine-albite aplites that formed around arfvedsonite pegmatite cores. Quartz-hosted melt inclusions in coarse-grained arfvedsonite granite and pegmatite give unequivocal evidence that the peralkaline composition and rare metal enrichments are primary magmatic features. Electron microprobe and SIMS analyses of rehomogenized inclusion glasses reveal their peralkaline high Si rhyolite compositions (avg molar [Na + K]/Al = 1.1) and very high contents of H2O (max 10.6 wt {\%}) and F (2.2 wt {\%}). Inclusion glasses also have high concentrations of incompatible trace elements including Nb (min 803 ppm), Zr (min 3,187 ppm), and REE + Y ($\Sigma$ = min 1,271 ppm). The REE, Zr, and Nb compositions of the aegirine-albite aplites plot along the same linear enrichment trends as the melt inclusion glasses, and Y/Ho ratios mostly display unfractionated near-chondritic values. The chemical and textural features of the aegirine-albite aplites are compatible with an origin by rapid crystallization (compositional quenching) after volatile loss from a residual peralkaline granitic melt of a composition like that of the melt inclusions. Interaction of postmagmatic fluorine-rich aqueous fluids with the arfvedsonite granites caused local remobilization of REE and secondary mineralization of fluorocarbonate phases, such as bastnaesite and fractionation of Y and Ho.},

abstract = {The Bushveld Complex in South Africa includes one of the world's largest anorogenic alkaline granite intrusions (66,000 km2). The granite forms a composite laccolith, of 350 x 250 km in area and about 2 km in thickness, which was emplaced at about 5 km depth into sediments overlying the Kaapvaal craton, at 2054 Ma. The Bushveld granite and its roof-rocks have long been mined for Sn, W and F. The Bushveld granites have high magnetic susceptibilities (K(m) from 1000 to 4000 $\mu$SI), and a quantitative model is presented, suggesting that susceptibility fabrics are primarily carried by ferromagnetic minerals. The measured AMS foliations coincide with observed subhorizontal mineral lineations and compositional layering. Magnetic lineation trends vary considerably within the horizontal plane. The existence of a weak planar fabric and, an almost absent linear component may reflect (a) laccolithic emplacement by roof uplift, causing flattening magmatic fabrics, or (b) emplacement of largely crystal-free magma crystallizing in-situ and developing horizontal compositional layering from thermal chemical diffusion fronts and gravity-driven mechanisms. Weak magnetic fabrics, like those identified in the Bushveld granites require specific sampling schemes and procedures, in addition to rigorous constraint of magnetic mineralogy and crystallization sequence.},

The dykes and the neighbouring massive dolomite (H8) body have similar geochemical characteristics, interpreted to indicate a carbonatitic magmatic origin. The occurrence of riebeckite-bearing fenitized quartzites marginal to both dykes and H8 dolomite body, and the presence of xenoliths in the latter, supports this conclusion. Taken together with previously published stable isotope data, these data confirm a mantle-derived origin for the H8 body. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe oxygen isotope composition of the dolomite and magnetite in the dykes is lower than that in the fine-grained dolomite. Oxygen data from samples of the coarse-grained dolomite host are either similar to the dykes or to the fine-grained type in agreement with their other geochemical characteristics. The carbonate-magnetite thermometric pairs of the fine-grained dolomite indicate a range of 350–540 °C, which is probably lower than that of the original main magmatic emplacement. This supports the distinction made between the original coarse-grained dolomite marble and dyke composition from the later fine-grained dolomite. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nThus the large H8 dolomite is interpreted as a carbonatite intrusion that contains wall-rock xenoliths and caused fenitization of the hanging wall, foot wall and the xenoliths, and that the coarse-grained portions of the H8 marble are those portions that, in the Late Proterozoic to Palaeozoic, escaped recrystallization to fine-grained dolomite and subsequent REE-Fe mineralization.},

abstract = {Igneous rocks of the Devonian Kola Alkaline Carbonatite Province (KACP) in NW Russia and eastern Finland can be classified into four groups: (a) primitive mantle-derived silica-undersaturated silicate magmas; (b) evolved alkaline and nepheline syenites; (c) cumulate rocks; (d) carbonatites and phoscorites, some of which may also be cumulates. There is no obvious age difference between these various groups, so all of the magma-types were formed at the same time in a relatively restricted area and must therefore be petrogenetically related. Both sodic and potassic varieties of primitive silicate magmas are present. On major element variation diagrams, the cumulate rocks plot as simple mixtures of their constituent minerals (olivine, clinopyroxene, calcite, etc). There are complete compositional trends between carbonatites, phoscorites and silicate cumulates, which suggests that many carbonatites and phoscorites are also cumulates. CaO/Al2O3 ratios for ultramafic and mafic silicate rocks in dykes and pipes range up to 5, indicating a very small degree of melting of a carbonated mantle at depth. Damkjernites appear to be transitional to carbonatites. Trace element modelling indicates that all the mafic silicate magmas are related to small degrees of melting of a metasomatised garnet peridotite source. Similarities of the REE patterns and initial Sr and Nd isotope compositions for ultramafic alkaline silicate rocks and carbonatites indicate that there is a strong relationship between the two magma-types. There is also a strong petrogenetic link between carbonatites, kimberlites and alkaline ultramafic lamprophyres. Fractional crystallisation of olivine, diopside, melilite and nepheline gave rise to the evolved nepheline syenites, and formed the ultramafic cumulates. All magmas in the KACP appear to have originated in a single event, possibly triggered by the arrival of hot material (mantle plume?) beneath the Archaean/Proterozoic lithosphere of the northern Baltic Shield that had been recently metasomatised. Melting of the carbonated garnet peridotite mantle formed a spectrum of magmas including carbonatite, damkjernite, melilitite, melanephelinite and ultramafic lamprophyre. Pockets of phlogopite metasomatised lithospheric mantle also melted to form potassic magmas including kimberlite. Depth of melting, degree of melting and presence of metasomatic phases are probably the major factors controlling the precise composition of the primary melts formed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Studies of natural fluid inclusions have shown that Cu commonly occurs at higher concentrations in vapor-type inclusions than in coexisting brine inclusions, a phenomenon which has been interpreted to arise from copper partitioning into the vapor phase. In the first part of this study, we attempted to experimentally reproduce this behavior in hydrothermal experiments covering a range of P–T conditions (600–800 °C, 70–130 MPa), fluid compositions (NaCl ± KCl ± FeCl2; 0.5–6.6 wt.{\%} S), fluid acidities (quench fluid pH ⩽0.3–10), and sulfur speciation (H2S-dominated to SO2-dominated). However, as in several other studies we did not succeed in reproducing conditions under which Cu partitions into the vapor phase. In view of recent observations that quartz-hosted fluid inclusions can diffusively loose or gain Cu after entrapment, we set out to determine if the evidence from natural fluid inclusions could be compromised. For this purpose we synthesized vapor and brine inclusions from Cu–H2O–NaCl–S fluids at 800 °C/130 MPa and re-equilibrated them in slightly different fluids at 800 °C/70 MPa, measuring some inclusions by LA-ICP-MS after each step. Vapor inclusions indeed experienced a dramatic increase in Cu from 0.3 ± 0.03 to 5.7 ± 3.3 wt.{\%}, while brine inclusions remained largely unmodified, leading to a change in the partition coefficient D Cu vap / brine from a true value (i.e., before re-equilibration) of 0.4 ± 0.05 to an apparent value of 8.3 ± 4.9. The requirements for substantial diffusional gain of Cu in fluid inclusions are a change in the pH of the surrounding fluid from ⩽1 to more neutral and the presence of S in the pre-existing fluid inclusions. These requirements are also fulfilled in nature: cooling magmatic-hydrothermal fluids experience a change from acidic to more neutral pH due to buffering along the feldspar-mica join, and natural vapor inclusions typically contain significant amounts of sulfur. A reversal experiment performed on natural, quartz-hosted fluid inclusions from the Erongo granite, Namibia, showed that this process can be reversed with the measured D Cu vap / brine value of 11 ± 9.3 being modified to 0.06 ± 0.04. Thus, D Cu vap / brine values {\textgreater}1 measured on natural fluid inclusions in quartz are likely a secondary feature caused by post-entrapment copper diffusion. Realistic D Cu vap / brine values in porphyry Cu environments are between 0.11 and 0.15, and reconstructed vapor/brine mass ratios are in the order of 4–9. This suggests that the main transporting agent of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on copper into the vapor phase are incorrect.},

The earliest generation of ferroan manganoan ecandrewsite of widely varying composition (Zn0.81–0.53Mn0.33–0.12Fe0.11–0.04)TiO3 is replaced by zincian pyrophanite (Mn0.82–0.34Zn0.50–0.20Fe0.13–0.06)TiO3. The latest generation is pyrophanite with only traces of zinc, showing a compositional evolution toward ferroan pyrophanite. The three generations of Zn–Mn titanates recognized on the basis of their paragenesis and composition crystallized during the subsolidus alteration of the lujavrite by evolving deuteric alkaline fluids. The enrichment in Zn, Mn, and Ti in these fluids resulted from the decomposition of earlier-formed magmatic-stage Zn- and Mn-bearing titano- and zirconosilicates. This is the first reported occurrence of a near-complete ecandrewsite – pyrophanite (ZnTiO3 – MnTiO3) solid-solution series.},

Alternatively, these features have been attributed to sources containing veined, metasomatized lithosphere. In melting experiments on natural amphibole-rich veins at 1.5 gigapascals, we found that partial melts of metasomatic veins can reproduce key major- and trace-element features of oceanic and continental alkaline magmas. Moreover, experiments with hornblendite plus lherzolite showed that reaction of melts of amphibole-rich veins with surrounding lherzolite can explain observed compositional trends from nephelinites to alkali olivine basalts. We conclude that melting of metasomatized lithosphere is a viable alternative to models of alkaline basalt formation by melting of recycled oceanic crust with or without sediment.},

Uranium deposits have been found in agpaitic rocks in Brazil (Po{\c{c}}os de Caldas), China (Saima) and Greenland (Il{\'{i}}maussaq), Nb and apetite deposits in Russia (Lovozero and Khibina).

The most important rare-element containing minerals are eudialyte (Zr, REE, Y, Nb), steenstrupine (U, Th, REE), rinkite (Nb, REE, Y, U), pyrochlore and perovskite (Nb, Ta), Li-mica (Li), chkalovite (Be) and villiaumite (F).

abstract = {The Lewisian Gneiss Complex of NW Scotland represents the eastern margin of the North Atlantic Craton. It comprises mid-late Archaean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite gneisses that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Late-Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic. A major swarm of mafic-ultramafic dykes, the Scourie Dyke Swarm, was intruded at ca. 2.4-2.3. Ga during a period of extension that can be correlated across the North Atlantic Craton. The majority of dykes are doleritic, with volumetrically minor picrite and olivine gabbro suites. New major and trace element geochemical data and Re-Os isotopes indicate that the Scourie Dyke Swarm was not solely derived from a 'typical' asthenospheric mantle source region. The geochemical signatures of the dykes show significant negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, coupled with enrichment in Th, Light Rare Earth Elements and other large ion lithophile elements. These features cannot be reproduced by simple contamination of asthenospheric sources with Lewisian granulite-facies crust. Instead they are a feature of the mantle source that produced the Scourie Dykes and may have developed during Archaean subduction episodes. Spinel lherzolite mantle xenoliths from the Isle of Lewis offer direct insight into the lithospheric mantle below this region. They display similar geochemical 'enrichments' and 'depletions' observed in the Scourie Dykes and the magma source is thus considered to reside primarily in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), with some potential contribution from asthenospheric melts. Platinum Group Element geochemistry and trace element modelling indicate that the dolerite dykes were formed by moderate ({\textless}15{\%}) partial melting of the source, whilst higher degrees of partial melting led to the formation of picritic and olivine gabbro suites. Magma production was triggered by significant crustal and lithospheric extension, causing both asthenospheric and substantial lithospheric melting. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The solubility mechanisms of water have been determined in melts along the anhydrous composition join SiO2NaAlO2 in the Al(Al + Si) range between 0 and 0.333 as a function of water content. Raman spectroscopy of melts quenched from 1550°C at 15 kbar have led to the following principal conclusions in regard to solubility mechanisms. Water dissolves by forming OH complexes with Si4+, Al3+ and Na+. Water also occurs in molecular form. SiOH bonds dominate in water-bearing silica melt, but SiOH bonds cannot be identified in melts with Al(Al + Si) ≧ 0.125 where, however, AlOH and NaOH complexes exist. The proportion of AlOH relative to NaOH in the hydroxyl complexes (XOHAl3+) in aluminosilicate melts increases with increasing bulk melt Al(Al + Si). With Al(Al + Si) = 0.125 XOHAl3+) is near 0, but for melts with Al(Al + Si) = 0.333XOHAl3+ exceeds 0.8. The proportion of Na-complexed hydroxyl is positively correlated with water content. The structural role of OH resembles that of F in melts along the join SiO2NaAlO2 where NaF and AlF complexes are formed. SiF bonds have not been observed in aluminosilicate melts. In both F- and H2O-bearing systems, nonbridging oxygens are formed in the melts, but F is a more efficient depolymerizer than water. This difference in polymerization reflects the relative stabilities of Al- and Na-bearing fluoride as compared with hydroxyl complexes. An empirical model from which the viscosity of hydrous aluminosilicate melts can be calculated is proposed. In the case of both F and H2O, the calculated viscosities reproduce the experimentally-determined viscosities within experimental and analytical uncertainty.},

abstract = {The source and evolution of magmas that form large igneous provinces is a controversial topic. At the center of the debate is whether the different reservoirs - continental crust, asthenosphere or sub-continental lithosphere - contribute to the formation and evolution of these provinces. The isotopic systematics of Re and Os offer significant new information to constrain this debate. Because Os is compatible and Re incompatible during mantle melting, the different possible melt reservoirs will develop distinct Os isotopic signatures over time. Therefore, the source of magmas and the different possible contaminants should be readily distinguishable using the Os isotopic system alone. We have focused our study on the Re and Os composition of the Columbia River basalt Group (CRBG), which is one of the youngest and best studied continental flood basalts provinces in the world. Samples from throughout the well documented stratigraphic column, that represent primitive and contaminated magmas, as well as samples emplaced in stable North American Craton and Mesozoic accreted terrane were analyzed. The initial Os-187/Os-188 ranges from the lowest value of similar to 0.13 in the most primitive Imnaha Formation and increases to values as high as 0.4 in flows from formations emplaced in the accreted terrane. Samples located on the craton have initial Os-187/Os-188 isotopic ratios that vary from similar to 1 to similar to 3. The data conclusively demonstrate that continental crust, most likely mafic lower crust, played an important role in the evolution of this flood basalt province. These data also show that the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) was not significantly involved in the formation or modification of these continental flood basalts.

abstract = {Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics, which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present, and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models. Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant, early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons. Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of a mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity. The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.},

Revisions are based on new structural data, empirical bond strength-bond length relationships, and plots of (1) radii vs volume, (2) radii vs coordination number, and (3) radii vs oxidation state. Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb5+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H- bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn2+-X, Cd2+-X, In2+-X, pb2+-X, and TI+-X.

abstract = {Re-examination of the Skaergaard Layered Series in the light of more extensive field work and sampling shows that the lithologic zones vary laterally as well as vertically, in both their bulk chemical composition and their mineralogical assemblages. The margins of the zones differ from both the central part of the Layered Series and Marginal Border Series in being richer in FeO*, TiO2, K2, P2O2, and most excluded elements. Mafic minerals tend to be more abundant and more iron-rich, plagioclase is more albitic and more strongly zoned, and apatite and biotite are more abundant near the margins.
When the average compositions of successive zones are compared, the abundances of most excluded components are seen to decline upward as far as Middle Zone then reverse their trends and increase through Upper Zone. P2O5 and K2O are negatively correlated in Upper Zones B and C, owing, perhaps, to separation of immiscible felsic liquids from the iron-rich magma. No evidence has been found for introduction of a new batch of less differentiated magma.
Layered rocks have an average composition that is more mafic than that of homogenous rocks at the same level. Blocks that fell from the roof have the opposite relation; they are greatly enriched in felsic components compared to the original compositions of the Upper Border Series from which they came.
Although some of the compositional variations may be consistent with differing degrees of fractionation of trapped liquids, no consistent relation has been found between the degree of fractionation and rates of crystal accumulation or cooling at the walls. Contamination with the metamorphic wall rocks, either by assimilation or by hydrothermal fluids, seems to have had only local effects and cannot account for the large-scale variations. At least some of the compositional differences must have resulted from late-stage processes that redistributed certain components after the intrusion reached advanced stages of solidification.},

abstract = {Hourglass sector zoning, and related polar overgrowths, are common features of metamorphic tourmaline, developing as a result of variations in element preference on the different growth surfaces. For sector-zoned crystals, three domains are present for each growth zone (c +, c − and a), with compositional differences most distinct for Ca and Ti, and among c + and c − sectors. Intersector differences vary, commonly showing decreasing fractionation from core to rim attributed to increasing metamorphic grade. Here we show that intersector element partitioning is temperature dependent and derive empirical geothermometers based on c + –c − and c + –a partitioning of Ca and Ti. These thermometers are applicable over a range of temperatures and bulk-rock compositions. Intersector partitioning is not affected by re-equilibration and records and preserves complete T-histories of individual tourmaline grains from prograde to peak and on to retrograde growth. Information on element mobility is preserved by tourmaline composition, because intersector partitioning is independent of element concentration. These factors make intersector partitioning an ideal tool to elucidate the thermal history of tourmaline grains and thus their host environment and tourmaline's refractory nature preserves these signatures even into the sedimentary record.},

abstract = {The restriction of most carbonatites to continental areas raises questions as to whether the parental liquids to carbonatites are generated within the continental lithosphere, or whether they are derived from deeper parts of the mantle with the lithosphere playing a subsidiary, but important, role in trapping volatile-rich melts/fluids. The constraints imposed by both radiogenic and stable isotopic data from carbonatites world-wide are consistent with a sub-lithospheric source for the parental melts, associated with either asthenospheric ‘upwellings' or more deep-seated, plume-related activity. Crucial evidences that support the generation of carbonated melts from sub-lithospheric mantle are: the petrogenetic and temporal association of carbonatites with large igneous provinces (LIPs; e.g., Deccan, Parana), carbonatites with primitive noble gas isotopic signatures, radiogenic isotope ratios similar to OIBs (i.e. involving HIMU, EM1 and FOZO mantle components), and the uniform, time-integrated Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd development lines for Sr and Nd isotopic data for carbonatites from the Superior Province, Canada, and the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Such findings are difficult to reconcile with a lithospheric origin. Even if a metasomatized lithospheric mantle is considered to be the sole source of carbonated melts, an unknown mantle process is required, large enough to generate widespread, synchronous metasomatism spanning regions in excess of 1 × 106 km2.},

abstract = {The 1200 m section of flat-lying basalts in the Mahabaleshwar area is divided into three formations on the basis of the trace elements Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr and Nb. The lowermost unit, the Poladpur Formation, is characterized by high Ba, Rb, and Zr/Nb, and low Sr. These features are accompained by high K and Si, high and variable [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7043-0.7196), and low and variable [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} values (+2.6 to -17.4). The formation is interpreted as having developed by contamination of the overlying Ambenali magma-type with ancient granitic crust, with simultaneous fractionation of a gabbroic mineral assemblage. The more basic members of the formation are found towards the base of the succession and are more contaminated than the upper flows. The succeeding Ambenali Formation, characterized by the Ambenali magma type, has low Ba, Rb, Sr and Zr/Nb, and low and rather uniform [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7038-0.7043) coupled with high and relatively uniform [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} (+4.7 to +6.4). It is interpreted as being essentially uncontaminated and derived from a mantle source with a history of slight trace-element enrichment relative to m.o.r.b.-source. The uppermost group of flows, the Mahabaleshwar Formation, is, like the Poladpur, enriched in Ba, Rb, K and Si relative to the Ambenali, but has lower Zr/Nb and higher Sr. [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios (0.7040-0.7056) are slightly higher than in the Ambenali, and [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} lies in the range +7.1 to -3.0. In this formation Sr correlates positively with the other incompatible elements and with [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr/[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}Sr initial ratios. This is in strong contrast to the relations observed in the Poladpur, and we believe that the behaviour of Sr may be a simple pointer to the distinction between mantle and crustal contributions. Assuming that late-stage crystal fractionation processes can be allowed for, if Sr correlates positively with elements such as K, Rb and Ba then mantle enrichment processes are clearly implied. Conversely, as for example in the Poladpur, if the correlation is negative, crustal contamination is suspected because Sr is unlikely to behave as an incompatible element in most crustal derived melts or fluids because of buffering by residual plagioclase. Furthermore, the relative uniformity of the Mahabaleshwar Formation, the position on the Sr and Nd isotope diagram close to the `mantle array', the fact that in terms of both incompatible element concentrations and isotopes the rocks are similar to tholeiites from oceanic islands such as Hawaii and Kerguelen, are all factors that reinforce the conclusion that these are mantle derived magmas which have suffered insignificant crustal contamination. They are, however, derived from a mantle which is trace-element enriched relative to the Ambenali source. Thus in the succession as a whole the crustal contribution appears to be small. Maximum amounts of contamination in the Poladpur Formation are difficult to determine but the average amount is probably in the region of 6-12 percentage mass. The whole sequence therefore contains a crustal contribution of about 2-3{\%}.},

Comparison of observedHf/Nd ratios with those inferred from isotopic plots indicates that, in addition to the two most prominent components at the surface of the Earth, the depleted mantle and the continental crust, at least one more reservoir, which is not a significant component in the source of oceanic basalts, is needed to account for the Bulk Silicate Earth Hf-Nd geochemistry. This unaccounted for component probably consists of subducted basalts, representing ancient oceanic crust and plateaus. The lower continental crust and subducted pelagic sediments are found to be unsuitable candidates. Although it would explain the Lu-Hf systematics of oceanic basalts, perovskite fractionation from an early magma ocean does not account for the associated Nd isotopic signature. Most basalts forming the mantle array tap a mantle source which corresponds to residues left by ancient melting events with garnet at the liquidus.},

After examining both the diverse tectonic environments in which the basaltic rocks are found, and also the various petrographic suites to which they belong, or appear to belong, new chemical criteria were devised to divide them into the following groups: (1) low-potash basalt, (2) high-alumina basalt, (3) continental-flood basalt, (4) komatiitic basalt, (5) sodic basalt, (6) hawaiite, (7) phonolitic basalt, (8) potassic basalt, (9) trachybasalt, (10) leucitite, (11) sodic transitional basalt, and (12) potassic transitional basalt. The lunar mare-basalts are regarded as being transitional in their chemical character between the low-potash, ocean-floor basalts and the komatiitic basalts. While it was relatively easy to discover petrogenetic models that were able to account for the origin and evolution of the common sub-alkalic basalts, and even the sodic basalts, a variety of possible petrogenetic models had to be explored in order to account for the origin and evolution of the different basaltic rocks of the potash- and high-potash series.},

abstract = {The Motzfeldt Centre is one of four major alkaline centres belonging to the Igaliko complex, part of the Mid-Proterozoic Gardar province of South Greenland. Motzfeldt comprises syenites and nepheline syenites displaying complex magmatic and subsolidus histories. Ta, Nb and REE-rich zones are associated with a pervasive hydrothermal alteration process in the North and East of the complex, part of a subdivision of the Centre called the Motzfeldt So Formation (MSF). The zircons from the MSF show textures that are both magmatic and altered, whereas the textures of pyrochlore have a predominantly subsolidus chemistry. We compare and contrast the radiogenic isotope geochemistry of the zircon and pyrochlore to obtain independent age estimates of the magmatic and hydrothermal episodes. Selected analyses of magmatic zircons are concordant with an age of 1,273 +/- A 6 Ma. Altered zircons are normally discordant with one intercept at 1,261 +/- A 28 Ma and the other at 349 +/- A 49 Ma. This younger age would appear on face value to date the hydrothermal event at Motzfeldt to similar to 900 Ma after the magmatism. However, the Pb-Pb isotope systematics from altered pyrochlore define an isochron age of 1,267 +/- A 6 Ma for isotopic closure of the pyrochlore following alteration during the subsolidus. There is no known magmatic event in Southern Greenland at similar to 350 Ma and discordant points have high common lead. We therefore infer that the younger intercept age is spurious. The overlap between the magmatic U-Pb zircon and the Pb-Pb pyrochlore age suggests that alteration of the Motzfeldt centre occurred shortly after magmatism.},

abstract = {Detailed stratigraphy based on whole-rock geochemistry is presented for a 1200 m sequence of basaltic lava flows in the Western Ghats escarpment near Mahabaleshwar. Five separate sections are used to define a regional dip of approximately 0-5° to the SW. From the base upwards the following formations are described: Bushe, Lower Poladpur, Upper Poladpur, Ambenali, and Mahabaleshwar. Inter-formation boundaries, with the exception of the Upper Poladpur-Ambenali, are sharp, and are particularly well defined by breaks in Sr-isotopic composition. Two of the formation bases are marked by abnormally mafic flows-- the Kamshedi picrite horizon at the base of the Upper Poladpur, and the Kelghar mafic unit at the base of the Mahabaleshwar. Major element compositions are controlled throughout largely by the degree of gabbro fractionation. Intense crustal contamination further modifies compositions in the lower part of the sequence (Bushe-Upper Poladpur) and has strong effects on trace elements and Sr-isotopes. Contamination decreases up-sequence leading to the comparatively uniform Ambenali rocks. The Mahabaleshwar Formation represents a change towards magmatism generated in an enriched mantle with many characteristics similar to those of oceanic island basalts. The geochemical discussion deals mainly with two well-developed mixing lines, one between Ambenali magmas and granitic crust, the other between ambenali magmas and the products of the postulated enriched mantle source. The detailed stratigraphic sequences strongly support the RTF (replenished, tapped, fractionated) magma chamber model of O Hara {\&}Mathews (1981) and the idea of periodical replenishment by picritic magmas (e. g. Huppert {\&} Sparks, 1980b). This is believed to be the first demonstration of such processes operating on a large scale in a continental basalt province.},

The Nd isotopic data are reported for 58 samples of supracrustal and granitoid rocks exposed along a 400 km, east-west, transect at 65{\~{}} across the structural grain of the province. Initial end values reveal distinctly different crustal sources in the eastern compared to the western parts of the province, as expected from tectonic assembly of the province through accretion of juvenile crust to older continental crust. Supracrustal sequences (ca. 2.71-2.65 Ga) from the central and eastern parts of the province have positive eNd(t) values (+ 0.3 to + 3.6), consistent with juvenile sources and formation remote from significantly older crust. Syn to late-deforma-tion (ca. 2.63-2.60 Ga), mantle-derived diorites and re-lated tonalites (type I) from the central and eastern parts of the province have similar initial eNa values (--0.1 to + 2.7). In contrast, samples from the westernmost plu-tons, which intrude exposed pre-3.1 Ga crust, have much lower eNdt0 values (--1.0 to --4.6) suggesting contamina-tion of these magmas by older crust.

abstract = {Partition coefficients for Rb, Sr, Sm, Nd, U, Th, Pb, La, Ce, Ba, Nb, and Li between phlogopite, clinopyroxene and melt were determined in order to characterize the effect of metasomatically grown minerals on the isotopic evolution of the earth's lithospheric mantle. Experiments were performed in a piston-cylinder-apparatus at 15 kbar and 1040-1175??C with leucite lamproite as starting composition. Three phlogopite/glass and one clinopyroxene/glass pairs were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Partition coefficients (D-values) for phlogopite/melt of Rb, Cs and Ba and Ti are ???0.5. D(Cs) is significantly lower than D(Rb) (0.50/1.34); in contrast to these two elements, D(Ba) varies between 0.3 and 1.6 in phlogopites of different major element composition. A similar behavior is suggested for the elements Sr (D = 0.02-0.06) and Pb (D {\~{}} 0.02). The partition coefficients measured for REE, Th and U are in the order of 10-4-10-6, those for Zr and Nb are 0.015 and 0.07 respectively, and D(Li) for phlogopite and melt is 0.2. Partition coefficients for REE and Sr between clinopyroxene and melt are relatively high compared to other studies, presumably because of the high wollastonite component in the clinopyroxenes of this work. The data for clinopyroxene as well as the data for phlogopite were used to calculate crystal lattice-site parameters for the M2-site in clinopyroxene and the X-site in phlogopite. Parameters for clinopyroxene are in good agreement with data from other works. For the phlogopite interlayer site, an optimum ionic radius of 1.71 ?? and polyhedral Young's moduli of 552 kbar (1+-cations) and 1087 kbar (2+-cations) were found. Recent data and the results of this study show that phlogopite is able to store significant amounts of Rb, Cs and Ba in the lithospheric mantle, thus causing a radiogenic evolution of Sr. In contrast, the influence of phlogopite on the Nd-isotope evolution is negligible because of the very low partition coefficients for Sm and Nd. The concentrations of Sr, Nd and Sm and the evolution of Nd isotopes in metasomatized lithospheric mantle are controlled by clinopyroxene, which significantly contributes to a less radiogenic evolution of Sr relative to the one caused by phlogopite. This implies that the evolution of Sr isotopes depends on the modal proportion of phlogopite and clinopyroxene.},

abstract = {A mantle value of ∼ 17.5 for Nb/Ta appears well established; less well established are crustal values of ∼ 11–12, although it appears that Nb/Ta for crustal-derived melts is less than mantle Nb/Ta, demonstrating fractionation of these two elements during crustal evolution, and suggesting that Nb/Ta variation may be indicative of a particular chemical process within the crust-mantle system.

Experimental studies on silicate and carbonatitic liquids at high pressure indicate that, although silicate minerals such as garnet, amphibole and clinopyroxene do fractionate Nb and Ta, the partition coefficients (D's) for both elements are very low. Thus involvement of these minerals may explain relatively small changes in Nb/Ta, but appears inadequate to explain the crust-mantle variation. However, high-quality data for Nb, Ta may be used to provide information on mantle melting or metasomatic processes (e.g., amphibole in the source region decreases Nb/Ta in derived melts, while carbonatitic metasomatism will increase Nb/Ta in affected mantle). Titanate minerals have high D's for Nb and Ta, and do fractionate these elements (e.g., DNbDTa rutile/liquid of 0.5–0.8), and their involvement in crystal fractionation would increase Nb/Ta in derivative liquids. In contrast, DNbDTa for rutile/fluid is ∼ 1.25, so that rocks affected by fluid equilibrated with residual rutile will show a decrease in Nb/Ta

Some Archaean gneisses appear to have high Nb/Ta, and may be a complementary component to that part of the crust which has a relatively low Nb/Ta, such as crustal-derived magmas (e.g., A- ad I-type granites and silicic volcanics). Within the crustal system pegmatites are known to have extremely high and variable Nb, Ta contents, often with low Nb/Ta. A fluid is generally considered to be involved in the generation of these rocks. Thus it is possible that fluid/melt partitioning may be the key to fractionating Nb and Ta, with preference for Ta in the fluid, and enrichment of Ta relative to Nb into the mid-upper crustal system, as the crust evolved, through upward movement of fluid.},

The A-type granites and mafic dyke rocks (125–130Ma) intruded later than the I-type rocks (140–143Ma) and whole-rock Nb/Ta ratios increase from I-type granites (12–14) via A-type granites (14–18) to mafic dykes (19–20). The $\epsilon$Nd(t) values for the two rock series are indistinguishable (about −4 to −8), whereas mafic dykes reach $\epsilon$Nd(t) values of up to +2. We suggest that I- and A-type granites generate from a common source dominated by lower crust, whereas the associated mafic dykes representing mantle-derived magma. We propose that the I-type rocks were emplaced during subduction of the paleo-Pacific slab, whereas subsequent tectonic extension triggered upwelling of mantle-derived magmas that provided sufficient heat to re-melt the residual lower crust, and crystallized to the A-type granites. Relative to I-type granites, the A-type rocks are F-rich (mean of 1230ppm vs. 540ppm) but poor in Cl (mean of 25ppm vs. 50ppm) and Br (mean of 130ppb vs. 200ppb), with indistinguishable I contents (from {\textless}1 to 30ppb). Apatite and biotite from the two rock series show very similar relationships in terms of their F and Cl contents. A potential role of F for the genesis of A-type rocks is indicated by positive correlations with whole-rock HFSE and HREE contents and many other trace elements (e.g., Ga, Tl, Rb, Be). Calculated F and Cl abundances for primary melts are much higher than the respective whole-rock F and Cl contents, supporting late-stage volatile release during magma evolution. We suggest that the elevated F contents in A-type granites may initially originate from a F-rich melt and further elevated during prolonged magma differentiation.},

Such systems are all to some degree unique, varying in their structural development, the interplay of petrogenetic complexes, and the range of lithologies. Peralkaline silicic reservoirs vary greatly in size and form (even beneath volcanoes of roughly similar size) but all are basalt-driven, in that basaltic magma is the fundamental source of heat and volatiles in the magmatic system. Fractional crystallisation of basaltic magma is the dominant differentiation mechanism but important contributions are made by magma mixing, remobilisation of crystal mushes and feldspar resorption, exsolution of carbonate phases and various volatile-magma interactions. Peralkaline silicic magmas are water-rich ({\textgreater} 4 wt.{\%}) and the rhyolitic varieties evolve to temperatures {\textless} 800 °C at oxygen fugacities largely within the range ∆FMQ 0 to − 1. They can be categorised as of cold-wet-reduced type. Low viscosities ({\textless} 104–106 Pa s) result in rapid growth of volcanic edifices, highly efficient crystal–melt separation and the ubiquitous development of compositionally zoned caps to reservoirs. No peralkaline equivalent of the monotonous intermediate ignimbrites found in some calc–alkaline systems has yet been found.},

Here we present new U-Pb and Hf isotope data on zircons from the only precisely dated Hadean rock unit on Earth--a 4,019.6 +/- 1.8 Myr tonalitic gneiss unit in the Acasta Gneiss Complex, Canada. Combined zircon and whole-rock geochemical data from this ancient unit shows no indication of derivation from, or interaction with, older Hadean continental crust. Instead, the data provide the first direct evidence that the oldest known evolved crust on Earth was generated from an older ultramafic or mafic reservoir that probably surfaced the early Earth.},

abstract = {Deccan Trap flood basalt volcanism reached its peak 65.5 (±1) million years ago, giving rise to a 2.7 km thick lava pile that formed the Western Ghats range near Mumbai. The total duration of this activity cannot be constrained better than ±1 Ma by conventional Ar-dating techniques. It is also difficult to know whether there were short bursts of tremendous volcanic activity within that period which could have significantly impacted global climate. Here we employ diffusion relaxation modeling of 87Sr/86Sr zoning in plagioclase to obtain a better resolution on the life cycle of a magma chamber in order to provide a minimum constraint on the duration of the Western Ghats volcanic episode.

The analyzed crystals are 2–5 cm long and occur in so-called Giant Plagioclase Basalt flows that mark the tops of the oldest formations of the Western Ghats. In the formation studied, such crystals may have recorded the life cycle of the magma chamber that fed the preceding flows. Our diffusion modeling yields 780 years for the maximum residence time for 5 cm long plagioclase crystals in the magma chamber and a mean growth rate of 2.03 × 10−10 cm s−1. Assuming continuous crystal growth while the underlying pile was being emplaced gives us a combined maximum rate of 0.13 m yr−1 for incubation and extrusion of the lava. Using this rate we estimate that the peak volcanic activity lasted a minimum of 21,100 years. A short duration for the Deccan would preclude AFC contamination processes during emplacement of the bulk of Deccan lavas.},

abstract = {The two parallel chains of Hawaiian volcanoes ('Loa' and 'Kea') are known to have statistically different but overlapping radiogenic isotope characteristics. This has been explained by a model of a concentrically zoned mantle plume, where the Kea chain preferentially samples a more peripheral portion of the plume. Using high-precision lead isotope data for both centrally and peripherally located volcanoes, we show here that the two trends have very little compositional overlap and instead reveal bilateral, non-concentric plume zones, probably derived from the plume source in the mantle. On a smaller scale, along the Kea chain, there are isotopic differences between the youngest lavas from the Mauna Kea and Kilauea volcanoes, but the 550-thousand-year-old Mauna Kea lavas are isotopically identical to Kilauea lavas, consistent with Mauna Kea's position relative to the plume, which was then similar to that of present-day Kilauea. We therefore conclude that narrow (less than 50 kilometres wide) compositional streaks, as well as the larger-scale bilateral zonation, are vertically continuous over tens to hundreds of kilometres within the plume.},

@article{Sørensen1992,
abstract = {The middle-Proterozoic peralkaline pluton at Strange Lake, Quebec/Labrador, comprises hypersolvus to subsolvus phases which are unusually enriched in Zr, Y, REEs, Nb, Be, and F, as exotic alkali and alkaline-earth silicate minerals. The highest concentrations of these elements are in subsolvus granite, which underwent intense low temperature (≤200°C) hydrothermal alteration involving hematization and the replacement of alkali high-field strength element (HFSE) minerals by calcic equivalents. This alteration is interpreted to have been caused by meteoric or formational waters. High temperature (≥ 350°C) alteration, attributed to orthomagmatic fluids, is evident in other parts of the subsolvus granite by the replacement of arfvedsonite by aegirine. Comparisons of the chemical compositions of fresh and altered rocks indicate that rocks subjected to high temperature alteration were chemically unaffected, except for depletion in Zr, Y, and HREEs. These elements were appreciably enriched in rocks that underwent low temperature alteration. Other elements affected by low temperature alteration include Ca and Mg, which were added and Na, which was removed. Available data on HFSE speciation in aqueous fluids and the chemistry of the pluton, suggest that the HFSEs were transported as fluoride complexes. If this was the case, the low temperature fluid could not have been responsible for HFSE transport, because the high concentration of Ca and low solubility of fluorite would have buffered F− activity to levels too low to permit significant complexation. We propose that HFSE mineralization and accompanying alteration were the result of mixing, in the apical parts of the pluton, of a F-rich, essentially Ca-free orthomagmatic fluid containing significant concentrations of HFSEs, with an externally derived meteoric-dominated fluid, enriched in Ca as a result of interaction with calc-silicate gneisses and gabbros. According to this interpretation, the latter fluid was responsible for the exchange of Ca for alkalis, mainly Na, in HFSE-rich minerals and, by sharply reducing F− activity in the mixed fluid through fluorite precipitation and/or increasing pH, destabilised the HFSE-fluoride complexes, causing deposition of HFSE-bearing minerals. An important implication of this study is that major HFSE enrichment may be restricted to those rare cases where F-rich, Ca-free, metal leaching environments and Ca-rich depositional environments are juxtaposed.},

abstract = {Sm-Nd isotopic compositions were determined for the peralkaline Il{\'{i}}maussaq Complex of the Gardar Province of southern Greenland. The majority of the samples in the agpaitic and augite syenitic units have near chondritic initial ɛNd(≈ 0), whereas a few samples trend towards ɛNd values as low as − 6 at the time of intrusion (1143 Ma). This latter value, from a sample taken from the margin of the complex, lying on the evolutionary trend for Ketilidian country-rock granitoids, suggests that large-scale contamination took place only at the margins of the complex. The similarity of the Nd isotopic compositions of the augite syenite and agpaitic units suggests that their parental magmas were derived from the same reservoir. A comparison of the Nd with existing Sr and Hf isotopic data for the complex suggests an origin by combined assimilation fractionation processes. Assimilation-fractional crystallization modeling of the isotopic compositions indicates that the Il{\'{i}}maussaq magmas could have formed through fractional crystallization of a basaltic melt while assimilating granitic crust. The model requires initially higher assimilation rates from basalt to augite syenite composition with subsequent decreasing assimilation rates from augite syenite to agpaitic compositions. Alkali granites, which formed after the intrusion of the augite syenites, have isotopic compositions intermediate between those of the augite syenites and the surrounding Ketilidian basement. This implies even greater amounts of assimilation and is interpreted as evidence for an origin through fractionation of a basaltic or augite syenite magma with concurrent assimilation of Ketilidian crust.},

Additionally, PX-NOM permits the use of the jadeite + quartz geobarometer for clinopyroxenes containing jadeite as well as various garnet-clinopyroxene Fe-Mg exchange thermometers. The barometer calculates a minimum pressure, if only secondary plagioclase is available in the mineral assemblage and therefore XAbPl has to be set to 1. The exchange thermometers show best results in LT-MT eclogites which bear only low contents of high-Si phases (quartz, feldspar).

abstract = {The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex consists of two chromitite layers separated by coarse-grained melanorite. Microstructural analysis of the chromitite layers using electron backscatter diffraction analysis (EBSD), high-resolution X-ray microtomography and crystal size distribution analyses distinguished two populations of chromite crystals: fine-grained idiomorphic and large silicate inclusion-bearing crystals. The lower chromitite layer contains both populations, whereas the upper contains only fine idiomorphic grains. Most of the inclusion-bearing chromites have characteristic amoeboidal shapes that have been previously explained as products of sintering of pre-existing smaller idiomorphic crystals. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for sintering of chromite crystals: (1) amalgamation of a cluster of grains with the same original crystallographic orientation; and (2) sintering of randomly orientated crystals followed by annealing into a single grain. The EBSD data show no evidence for clusters of similarly oriented grains among the idiomorphic population, nor for earlier presence of idiomorphic subgrains spatially related to inclusions, and therefore are evidence against both of the proposed sintering mechanisms. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis maps show deformation-related misorientations and curved subgrain boundaries within the large, amoeboidal crystals, and absence of such features in the fine-grained population. Microstructures observed in the lower chromitite layer are interpreted as the result of deformation during compaction of the orthocumulate layers, and constitute evidence for the formation of the amoeboid morphologies at an early stage of consolidation. An alternative model is proposed whereby silicate inclusions are incorporated during maturation and recrystallisation of initially dendritic chromite crystals, formed as a result of supercooling during emplacement of the lower chromite layer against cooler anorthosite during the magma influx that formed the Merensky Reef. The upper chromite layer formed from a subsequent magma influx, and hence lacked a mechanism to form dendritic chromite. This accounts for the difference between the two layers.},

The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

abstract = {The Mesoproterozoic Pilanesberg Complex, South Africa, is built up by several distinct, ring-shaped intrusions of syenite and peralkaline nepheline syenite. A mildly peralkaline ((Na + K) / Al = 1.04–1.09), medium-to coarse grained nepheline syenite makes up the outermost ring in the southwestern part of the complex (“Matooster type white foyaite”). In this rock, mafic silicate minerals (amphibole, biotite, aegirine) and Ti-bearing minerals (ilmenite, astrophyllite, aenigmatite, lorenzenite, bafertisite, jinshajiangite) are interstitial to feldspar and nepheline, and define a series of mineral assemblages reflecting a change from a miaskitic crystallization regime (with Na-Ca amphibole, titanite and ilmenite) to increasingly agpaitic conditions (with arfvedsonite, aegirine, astrophyllite, aenigmatite, lorenzenite). The main driving force behind the evolution was an increase in peralkalinity of the trapped liquid, mainly by adcumulus growth of alkali feldspar and nepheline, which in the later stages of evolution was combined with increases in oxygen fugacity and water activity. Unlike in most other agpaitic rock complexes, Zr remained compatible in aegirine (and to some extent in amphibole) almost to the end of the process, when a hydrous zirconium silicate mineral (hilairite) crystallized as the only mineral in the rock having essential zirconium. The presence of minerals such as hilairite, bafertisite, jinshajiangite and a Na-REE-Sr rich apatite group mineral (fluorcaphite ?) in the latest assemblages suggests that the last remaining interstitial melt or fluid approached a hyperagpaitic composition. The isolated melt pockets in the Pilanesberg white foyaite follow a pattern of evolution that can be seen as a miniature analogue of the fractional crystallization processes controlling magma evolution in large, alkaline igneous rock complexes.},

The run-products with the same starting composition from E3-S1 (3°C/min) show a high reproducibility in terms of crystal shape, size, and amount ({\textless}4 area{\%}). This demonstrates that the crystallization path is not affected by the different heat treatments above the liquidus temperature, i.e. the time scale of structural re-equilibration (relaxation) and chemical re-homogenisation are shorter than the experimental time scale. Possible chemical heterogeneities on a length scale of several micrometres for R100 and several hundreds of micrometres for B100 can be removed at 1300°C within 120min. A heat treatment at 1300°C for 120min significantly reduces the amount of $\mu$m-sized bubbles, potentially responsible for the onset of nucleation. The experimental reproducibility is low when the cooling path intersects the tip of the time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curves, i.e. when the nucleation rate is near its maximum (Imax). In that case, even small thermal variations in cooling rate and local composition can have large effects on phase abundance and crystal size. Dynamic crystallization experiments can be properly interpreted and compared only if they are texturally homogeneous and the physico-chemical state of the superheated silicate liquid is known. The solidification conditions used in this study mirror those of aphyric lavas and dikes emplaced at shallower crustal levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The late Cretaceous-early Tertiary flood basalts in the Gujarat area of the northwestern Deccan Traps (Kathiawar peninsula, Pavagadh hills and Rajpipla) exhibit a wide range of compositions, from picrite basalts to rhyolites; moreover, the basaltic rocks have clearly distinct TiO2 contents at any given degree of differentiation and strongly resemble the low-titanium and hightitanium basalts found in most of the Gondwana continental flood basalt (CFB) suites. Four magma groups are petrologically and geochemically distinguished:$\backslash$n(1) A low-Ti group, characterized by rocks with varying SiO2 saturation, and with TiO2 {\textless}1⋅8 wt{\%}, extremely low incompatible trace element abundances, low Zr/$\gamma$ (av- 3⋅8), Ti/ V (av. 27), and a very slight large ion lithophile element (LJLE) enrichment over high field strength elements (HFSE). These rocks share some features with the Bushe Formation of the Western Ghats farther south, but have distinct geochemical characters, in particular the strong depletion in most incompatible trace elements.$\backslash$n(2) A high-Ti group, characterized by a more K-rich character than the low-Ti rocks, and with a strong enrichment in incompatible elements, similar to average ocean island basalt (OIB), e.g. high TiO2 ({\textgreater}1⋅8 wt{\%} in picrites), Nb ({\textgreater}19 p.p.m.) Zr/$\gamma$ (av. 6⋅5) and Tt/V (av. 47).$\backslash$n(3) An intermediate-Ti group, with TiO2 contents slightly lower than the high-Ti rocks at the same degree of evolution, and with correspondingly lower incompatible trace element contents and ratios, in particular K2O, Nb, Ba and Zr/Y (av. 5⋅2).$\backslash$n(4) A potassium-rich group (KT), broadly similar in geochemical character to the high-Ti group but showing more extreme K, Rb and Ba enrichment (av. K20/Na20∼l; Ba/Y∼20).$\backslash$nThe most primitive low-Ti and high-Ti picrites, when corrected for low-pressure olivine fractionation, show distinct major (and trace) element geochemistry, in particular for CaO/AI2O3, CaO/TiO2 and Al2O3/TiO2, and moderate but significant variations in their SiO2 and Fe2Ost contents; these characteristics strongly suggest the involvement of different mantle sources, more depleted for the low-Ti picrites, and richer in cpxfor the high-Ti picrites, but with broadly the same pressures of equilibration (27–14 kbar). This, in turn, suggests a strong lateral heterogeneity in the Gujarat Trap mantle. Low-Ti picrites and related differentiates in Kathiawar are reported systematically for the first time here, and suggest the existence of HFSE-depleted mantle in the northwestern Deccan Traps, with extension at least to the Seychelles Islands and to the area of the Bushe Formation near Bombay in the pre-drift position, before the development of the Carlsberg Ridge. The absence of correlations between LILE/HFSE ratios and SiO2 argues against crustal contamination processes acting on the low-Ti picrites, possibly owing to their probably rapid uprise to the surface. Consequently, the mantle region of this rock group was probably re-enriched by small amounts of ULE-rich materials. The substantially higher, trace element enrichment of the least differentiated high-Ti picrites, relative to the basalts of the Ambe-noli and Mahableshwar Formations of the Western Ghats, testifies also to the presence of more incompatible element rich, OIB4ike mantle sources in northern and northwestern Gujarat. These sources were geochemicaily similar to the present-day Reunion mantle sources.},

abstract = {A compendium of diffusion measurements and their Arrhenius equations for water, carbon dioxide, sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine in silicate melts similar in composition to natural igneous rocks is presented. Water diffusion in silicic melts is well studied and understood, however little data exists for melts of intermediate to basic compositions. The data demonstrate that both the water concentration and the anhydrous melt composition affect the diffusion coefficient of water. Carbon dioxide diffusion appears only weakly dependent, at most, on the volatile-free melt composition and no effect of carbon dioxide concentration has been observed, although few experiments have been performed. Based upon one study, the addition of water to rhyolitic melts increases carbon dioxide diffusion by orders of magnitude to values similar to that of 6 wt{\%} water. Sulfur diffusion in intermediate to silicic melts depends upon the anhydrous melt composition and the water concentration. In water-bearing silicic melts sulfur diffuses 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than water. Chlorine diffusion is affected by both water concentration and anhydrous melt composition; its values are typically between those of water and sulfur. Information on fluorine diffusion is rare, but the volatile-free melt composition exerts a strong control on its diffusion. At the present time the diffusion of water, carbon dioxide, sulfur and chlorine can be estimated in silicic melts at magmatic temperatures. The diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in basic to intermediate melts is only known at a limited set of temperatures and compositions. The diffusion data for rhyolitic melts at 800 degrees C together with a standard model for the enrichment of incompatible elements in front of growing crystals demonstrate that rapid crystal growth, greater than 10 (super -10) m s (super -1) , can significantly increase the volatile concentrations at the crystal-melt interface and that any of that melt trapped by the formation of melt inclusions may not be representative of the bulk melt. However, basaltic melt inclusions trapped at 1300 degrees C are more likely to contain bulk melt concentrations of water and carbon dioxide.},

abstract = {Many of the early Cretaceous intrusive complexes in the Damaraland of west-central Namibia are silicic in composition. Although all have trace element characteristics typical for the so-called A-type granites, major differences in alkali/aluminum ratios and isotopic compositions require diverse magma sources. This paper presents Nd and O isotope data from the five largest silicic complexes (Paresis, Erongo, Brandberg, Cape Cross, Gross Spitzkoppe) that provide new constraints on the nature of crustal and mantle sources involved, and their relative proportions. The Paresis complex has an isotopic signature ($\delta$18O= +9 ‰, $\epsilon$Nd130Ma= -21) indicating a crustal component similar to Mesoproterozoic gneisses of the Angola craton. The other complexes have isotope variations ($\delta$18O from +8.1‰ to +10.7‰ and $\epsilon$Nd130Mafrom -1 to -9) that can be explained by a binary mixing model between a mantle and crustal component. More importantly, this same mixing line also fits the Nd-O isotope variations reported from the mafic Okenyenya and Messum complexes, and from rhyodacites in the southern Etendeka volcanic sequence. The uniformity of the crustal component implied by this mixing model suggests lower crustal material, in contrast to the geologic complexity of the Neoproterozoic Damara Belt presently exposed at the surface. This is consistent with the isotopic data, and we interpret the crustal component to be lower crustal metametasediments that were dehydrated and perhaps melt-depleted by generation of the S-type granites, which are widespread in the Damara Belt. The mantle component is interpreted to be dominated by the Tristan mantle plume, but some involvement of depleted mantle material is needed to explain all of the isotope data. The data rule out any significant role for enriched, subcontinental mantle lithosphere. All silicic Damaraland complexes, as well as the Etendeka rhyodacites, classify as A-type granites despite their proven source diversity. This means that the A-type geochemical characteristics of these and, by analogy, other anorogenic granites, does not depend on a particular magma source. The unifying feature of the diverse granites in the Damaraland is likely to be related to the high temperatures involved, which allow partial melting of dehydrated, and possibly melt-depleted, lower crustal lithologies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In most published hydrothermal ore deposit models, the main agent of metal transport is an aqueous liquid. However, there is increasing evidence from volcanic vapors, geothermal systems (continental and submarine), vapor-rich fluid inclusions, and experimental studies that the vapor phase may be an important and even dominant ore fluid in some hydrothermal systems. This paper reviews the evidence for the transport of metals by vapor (which we define as an aqueous fluid of any composition with a density lower than its critical density), clarifies some of the thermodynamic controls that may make such transport possible, and suggests a model for the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits that involves precipitation of the ores from vapor or a vapor-derived fluid. Analyses of vapor (generally {\textgreater}90{\%} water) released from volcanic fumaroles at temperatures from 500° to over 900°C and near-atmospheric pressure typically yield concentrations of ore metals in the parts per billion to parts per million range. These vapors also commonly deposit appreciable quantities of ore minerals as sublimates. Much higher metal concentrations (from ppm to wt {\%}) are observed in vapor inclusions trapped at pressures of 200 to 1,000 bars in deeper veins at lower temperatures (400°–650°C). Moreover, concentrations of some metals, notably Cu and Au, are commonly higher in vapor inclusions than they are in inclusions of coexisting hypersaline liquid (brine). Experiments designed to determine the concentration of Cu, Sn, Ag, and Au in HCl-bearing water vapor at variable although relatively low pressures (up to 180 bars) partly explain this difference. These experiments show that metal solubility is orders of magnitude higher than predicted by volatility data for water-free systems, and furthermore that it increases sharply with increasing water fugacity and correlates positively with the fugacity of HCl. Thermodynamic analysis shows that metal solubility is greatly enhanced by reaction of the metal with HCl and by hydration, which results in the formation of species such as MeClm.nH2O. Nonetheless, the concentrations measured by these experiments are considerably lower than those measured in experiments involving aqueous liquids or determined for vapor fluid inclusions. A possible explanation for this and for the apparent preference of metals such as Cu and Au for the vapor over the coexisting brine in some natural settings is suggested by limited experimental studies of metal partitioning between vapor and brine. These studies show that, whereas Cu, Fe, and Zn all partition strongly into the liquid in chloride-bearing sulfur-free systems, Cu partitions preferentially into the vapor in the presence of significant concentrations of sulfur. We therefore infer that high concentrations of Cu and Au in vapor inclusions reflect the strong preference of sulfur for the vapor phase and the formation of sulfur-bearing metallic gas species. Phase stability relationships in the system NaCl-H2O indicate how vapor transport of metals may occur in nature, by showing a range of possible vapor evolution paths for the conditions of porphyry-epithermal systems. At the world-class Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Au deposit, evidence from fluid inclusions supports a model in which a single-phase fluid of intermediate to vapor-like density ascends from a magma chamber. On cooling and decompression, this fluid condenses a small fraction of brine by intersecting the two-phase surface on the vapor side of the critical curve, without significantly changing the composition of the expanding vapor. Vapor and brine reach Cu-Fe sulfide saturation as both phases cool below 425°C. Vapor, which is the dominant fluid in terms of the total mass of H2O, Cu, and probably even Cl, is interpreted to be the main agent of metal transport. The evolution of fluids leading to high-grade epithermal gold mineralization is initiated by an H2S-, SO2-, Au-, and variably Cu- and As-rich vapor, which separates from an FeCl2-rich brine in a subjacent porphyry environment. In the early stages of the hydrothermal system, vapor expands rapidly and on reaching the epithermal environment, condenses, producing hypogene advanced argillic alteration and residual vuggy quartz and, in some cases, coeval high-sulfidation precious metal mineralization (e.g., Pascua). More commonly, the introduction of precious metals occurs somewhat later, after the site of magmatic fluid exsolution has receded to greater depth. Because of the relatively high pressure, the vapor separating from brine at this stage cools along a pressure-temperature path above the critical curve of the system, causing it to contract to a liquid capable of transporting several parts per million Au to temperatures as low as 150°C.},

abstract = {A new thermodynamic model for sodic pyroxenes involving jadeite-diopside-hedenbergite-acmite is presented. This model allows for ordering of Mg, Al, Fe2+, and Fe3+ on the M I sites, with coupled Na and Ca ordering on the M2 sites. It is calibrated on the basis of experiments in three chemical subsystems together with available information on ordering in different pyroxenes and on the limited calorimetric data. Central to the determination of the parameters of the model is the use of relationships among the end-member Gibbs energies and the interaction energies in the various possible non-independent sets of end-members. An important aspect of this model, which uses the symmetric formalism, is that Fe-Mg (FM) and Al-Fe3+ (AF') mixing is not assumed to be ideal. The model accounts successfully for the experiments at both 600 degrees C and at higher temperatures involving ordered and disordered pyroxenes coexisting with albite and quartz in NCMAS, NCFAS, NF'AS systems as well as the available calorimetry. It is also able to predict the positions and slopes of tielines in coexisting jadeite + omphacite and omphacite + augite found in nature at lower temperatures. Although the model requires a large number of energy parameters, some of these are not critical to the behavior of the model, while for others the constraints from experiment, calorimetry, ordering state and solvi lead to very limited allowable combinations. The model places some restrictive constraints on the shape of the phase relations in the jadeite-augite-acmite system. Petrological applications of the model are illustrated via a phase diagram example for a MORB bulk composition eclogite.},

abstract = {The rare-earth elements (REE) are a group of seventeen speciality metals that have unique and diverse chemical, magnetic, and luminescent properties that make them strategically important in a number of high-technology industries. Consequently, the REE are increasingly becoming more attractive commodity targets for the mineral industry. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the distribution, geological characteristics and resources of Australia's major REE deposits. REE in Australia are associated with igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks in a wide range of geological environments. Elevated concentrations of these elements have been documented in various heavy-mineral sand deposits (beach, dune, marine tidal, and channel), carbonatite intrusions, (per)alkaline igneous rocks, iron-oxide breccia complexes, calc-silicate rocks (skarns), fluorapatite veins, pegmatites, phosphorites, fluviatile sandstones, unconformity-related uranium deposits, and lignites. The distribution and concentration of REE in these deposits are influenced by various rock-forming processes including enrichment in magmatic or hydrothermal fluids, separation into mineral species and precipitation, and subsequent redistribution and concentration through weathering and other surface processes. The lanthanide series of REE (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium show a close genetic and spatial association with alkaline felsic igneous rocks, however, scandium in laterite profiles has a closer affinity with ultramafic/mafic igneous rocks.A mineral-system approach has been used in this review to classify the major Australian REE deposits according to various mineralising criteria and/or associated geological events. This hierarchical classification framework has the advantage over more traditional descriptive classifications in that it has the benefits of attempting to understand those geological processes considered critical to the formation of a particular deposit type, and also it has a more predictive capacity for identifying potential new areas and types of REE mineralisation. The highest level of the classification comprises four general 'mineral-system association' categories, regolith, basinal, metamorphic, and magmatic, which in turn contain sixteen 'deposit type' members, namely: regolith - carbonatite-associated; ultramafic/mafic rock-associated; basinal - heavy mineral sand deposits in beach, high dune, offshore shallow marine tidal, and tidal environments; phosphorite; lignite; unconformity-related; metamorphic - calc-silicate; and magmatic - (per)alkaline rocks; carbonatite; pegmatite; skarn; apatite and/or fluorite veins; and iron-oxide breccia complex.The review summarises the geological factors considered important for the formation of REE deposits. These factors can be used to identify mappable features in databases, which in turn can be applied to produce mineral potential/prospectivity maps. ?? 2014 .},

Our results confirm the REE concentrations of Taylor and McLennan's [Taylor, S.R., McLennan, S.M., 1985. The continental crust: its composition and evolution. Blackwell, Oxford, 312 pp.] estimate of the upper continental crust but suggest substantial revisions for Nb and Ta, in agreement with recent work of Plank and Langmuir [Plank, T., Langmuir, C.H., 1998. The chemical composition of subducting sediment and its consequences for the crust and mantle. Chem. Geol. 145, 325–394.]. From our data, the upper continental crust has average Nb=11.5±2.6 ppm (instead of 25 ppm) and Ta=0.92±0.12 ppm (instead of 2.2 ppm), which translates into a bulk crust Nb=8 ppm, Ta=0.7 ppm, La/Nb=2.2, and Nb/Ta=12–13. These revisions confirm the crustal subchondritic Nb/Ta and superchondritic La/Nb ratios and reinforce the observation that the continental crust and the Depleted Mantle are not strictly complementary: an additional Nb- and Ta-rich reservoir having superchondritic Nb/Ta is required to balance the Silicate Earth. Using the continental crust's La/Nb ratio to estimate the proportions of crustal growth in convergent margin and intraplate settings, we suggest a plume contribution of only between 5 and 20{\%} to the continents, even lower than previous estimates.},

abstract = {Current ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) accounts for about ten per cent of observed global sea-level rise. Losses are dominated by dynamic thinning, in which forcings by oceanic or atmospheric perturbations to the ice margin lead to an accelerated thinning of ice along the coastline. Although central to improving projections of future ice-sheet contributions to global sea-level rise, the incorporation of dynamic thinning into models has been restricted by lack of knowledge of basal topography and subglacial geology so that the rate and ultimate extent of potential WAIS retreat remains difficult to quantify. Here we report the discovery of a subglacial basin under Ferrigno Ice Stream up to 1.5 kilometres deep that connects the ice-sheet interior to the Bellingshausen Sea margin, and whose existence profoundly affects ice loss. We use a suite of ice-penetrating radar, magnetic and gravity measurements to propose a rift origin for the basin in association with the wider development of the West Antarctic rift system. The Ferrigno rift, overdeepened by glacial erosion, is a conduit which fed a major palaeo-ice stream on the adjacent continental shelf during glacial maxima. The palaeo-ice stream, in turn, eroded the /`Belgica/' trough, which today routes warm open-ocean water back to the ice front to reinforce dynamic thinning. We show that dynamic thinning from both the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Sea region is being steered back to the ice-sheet interior along rift basins. We conclude that rift basins that cut across the WAIS margin can rapidly transmit coastally perturbed change inland, thereby promoting ice-sheet instability.},

abstract = {The island of Pantelleria is located in the Pantelleria Rift between Sicily and Africa. This rift is floored by a 20 km thick continental-type crust that is characterized by horsts and grabens formed by NW-SE tensional faults and NE-SW shear faults. Several faults and fractures that intersect the island follow these regional trends. Prominent volcano-tectonic features on the island include two calderas, the younger being related to the eruption of the green ignimbrite and the uplifted Montagna Grande block. Pantelleria mostly consists of peralkaline silicic rocks with minor trachytes and basalts. Volcanism on the island is characterized by both explosive and effusive activity. Reconstruction of the volcanic history of the island since the eruption of the green ignimbrite is based on geological and geochronological data. The eruption of the green ignimbrite (50,000 y.b.p.) was followed by collapse of the Monastero caldera that has been the site of most of the subsequent acid volcanism. The Montagna Grande volcanic complex (35,000 y.b.p.) fills the central part while the lower pantelleritic lava flows (16,000 y.b.p.) erupted along its rim. Very probably the young Mt. Gelfiser and Khaggiar domes are also located on the caldera rim. The Montagna Grande block rose within the caldera at an estimated average rate between 1.0 and 1.5 cm/y for about 20,000 y. Subsequent pumice cones (9,000 y.b.p.), endogenous domes, and lava flows also erupted inside this caldera. Among the main acid volcanic units younger than the green ignimbrite, only the Mt. Gelkhamar endogenous dome is not linked to this caldera. In the last 50,000 years basaltic activity only occurred in the northern part of the island. The basaltic vents are aligned parallel with the main tensional trends of the rift. At least two phases have been recognized; the older is about 29,000 y.b.p. and the younger is a few thousands of years old. A change occurred in the eruptive style after the eruption of the green ignimbrite and collapse of the Monastero caldera. Explosive activity diminished and extrusion of lava became dominant.},

abstract = {The layered agpaitic nepheline syenites (kakortokites) of the Il{\'{i}}maussaq complex, South Greenland, host voluminous accumulations of eudialyte-group minerals (EGM). These complex Na-Ca-zirconosilicates contain economically attractive levels of Zr, Nb and rare-earth elements (REE), but have commonly undergone extensive autometasomatic/hydrothermal alteration to a variety of secondary mineral assemblages. Three EGM alteration assemblages are recognized, characterized by the secondary zirconosilicates catapleiite, zircon and gittinsite. Theoretical petrogenetic grid models are constructed to assess mineral stabilities in terms of component activities in the late-stage melts and fluids. Widespread alteration ofEGMto catapleiite records an overall increase inwater activity, and reflects interaction ofEGM with late-magmatic Na-, Cl- and F-rich aqueous fluids at the final stages of kakortokite crystallization. Localized alteration of EGM and catapleiite to the rare Ca-Zr silicate gittinsite, previously unidentified at Il{\'{i}}maussaq, requires an increase in CaO activity and suggests post-magmatic interaction with Ca-Sr bearing aqueous fluids. The pseudomorphic replacement ofEGMin the kakortokiteswas not found to be associated with significant remobilization of the primary Zr, Nb and REE mineralization, regardless of the high concentrations of potential transporting ligands such as F and Cl. We infer that the immobile behaviour essentially reflects the neutral to basic character of the late-magmatic fluids, in which REE-F compounds are insoluble and remobilization of REE as Cl complexes is inhibited by precipitation of nacareniobsite-(Ce) and various Ca-REE silicates.Asubsequent decrease in F–activity would furthermore restrict the mobility of Zr as hydroxyl-fluoride complexes, and promote precipitation of the secondary zirconosilicates within the confines of the replaced EGM domains.

abstract = {Dehydration (vapour absent) partial melting reactions in the Earth's crust produce a hydrous granitic melt phase, new anhydrous minerals that are mostly pyroxenes, and new plagioclase more calcic than the initial plagioclase. These solid phases of the melt reaction are restite. If the restite is carried to high levels in the crust as a component of the magma, cooling and crystallisation to granite will result in back reactions in which the H2O in the melt phase is consumed and is not then available to form a hydrothermal solution. Even in magmas in which some restite has been removed there will be some back reaction and again less H2O. Only fractional crystallisation will enrich the H2O in the magma in sufficient amounts to form a substantial quantity of hydrothermal solution and possible mineralisation.},

abstract = {Synthetic samples with different chemical compositions along the hedenbergite–aegirine (CaFe2+Si2O6–NaFe3+Si2O6) solid-solution series have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and 57Fe M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy. All compounds show C2/c symmetry, both at 298 K and at low temperature (100 K). The structural changes within the hedenbergite–aegirine series are dominated by the M1 site while the M2 site plays a minor role. Replacement of Fe2+ by Fe3+ increases the polyhedral distortion of the M1 site and causes an increased repulsion between neighboring M1 sites. The changes in M1-site geometry also induce distinct alterations within the kinking state of the tetrahedral chains, but the changes in tetrahedral bond lengths and angles are small. In addition to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments, a large number of synthetic samples were investigated by 57Fe M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy at 298 K and, for three selected compositions, between 80 and 700 K. Here, substantial line broadening of the Fe2+ resonance absorption was observed as an aegirine component is substituted. Two different groups of local distortion environments were observed for Fe2+ within the solid-solution series, which change relative proportions and numeric value of the quadrupole splitting as a function of chemistry and temperature. This line broadening cannot be ascribed to discrete next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) configurations of Ca and Na as has been done in the literature. Above {\~{}}250 K, additional resonance absorption appears in the spectra of samples with aegirine components between 20 and 75 mol{\%}. This absorption gains intensity with increasing temperature, while the 57Fe hyperfine parameters approach values intermediate between Fe2+ and Fe3+. This effect is ascribed to fast electron delocalization between Fe2+ and Fe3+ at elevated temperature.},

abstract = {The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic and trace element compositions of basalts and pantellerites from the island of Pantelleria (Strait of Sicily) have been used to constrain the evolution of these magmas and their sources. All Pantelleria products have isotopic compositions that plot in SrPb, NdPb and SrNd space between DMM and HIMU oceanic mantle sources. The Pantelleria basalts have variable Ce/Pb, Nb/U and Th/U, and some have elevated 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, which is indicative of the addition of an older component that resembles old enriched lithosphere sampled by potassic magmas in the circum-Tyrrhenian Sea. It is proposed that the relatively homogeneous pantellerites derive their Ce/Pb, Nb/U, and OIB-like Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions from a well-mixed crustal magma chamber supplied by heterogeneous basalts. We propose further that the radiogenic 206Pb/204Pb and 143Nd/144Nd, coupled with the unradiogenic Sr isotopic composition of some of the Pantelleria basalts, are inherited in a process involving chemical modification of the thinned lithospheric crust-mantle source by addition of basaltic (MORB) materials, a process that may have occurred intermittently at least since the Permo-Triassic. This process is responsible for lowering the Pb concentration and changing the U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios of portions of the lithospheric crust-mantle boundary. It is envisaged that the increase in $\mu$ and $\omega$ of the modified lithospheric mantle was caused by the addition of phases such as clinopyroxene and amphibole, crystallized in equilibrium with MORB. After chemical exchange with the asthenospheric mantle ceased during the Hercynian orogeny, this young (or rejuvenated) lithosphere evolved a radiogenic Pb isotopic composition. It is proposed that the isotopic differences observed between the volcanic rocks erupted in the Strait of Sicily and those erupted in the southern margin of the Tyrrhenian abyssal plain are primarily the result of mixing between magmas derived from a variably modified lithospheric source, some of it with OIB-type isotopic characteristics, that were developed by intermittent interaction with asthenospheric melts in a geodynamic regime dominated by extension.},

In this study, we use the lithium (Li) isotope composition of Ediacaran cap dolostones from South Australia (Nuccaleena Formation) and China (Doushantuo Fm) to investigate changes in ocean chemistry that followed the Marinoan deglaciation. The effect of diagenesis was evaluated and while the Nuccaleena Fm is likely to have preserved the primary composition of cap dolostone deposition, the offset in Li isotope ratios observed for the Doushantuo Fm could possibly reflect partial overprinting by diagenetic fluids. The Li isotope composition of Ediacaran seawater was estimated and we suggest it was similar to that of late Cenozoic oceans for most of the cap dolostone deposition. Using a box model for the oceanic Li cycle, we show that at the onset of deglaciation, the supply of riverine Li to the oceans was up to 50 times the modern flux. The modelled riverine Li isotope composition suggests that continents resembled modern high-latitude regions during this time. This episode was short-lived (up to 1{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Myr) and the subsequent supply of riverine Li was similar to modern conditions, both in flux and isotope composition, for the whole duration of cap dolostone deposition. These results suggest that Ediacaran oceans and continents rapidly recovered from the Marinoan glaciation to reach environmental conditions similar to the late Cenozoic. From the standpoint of the Li oceanic budget, the Ediacaran oceans in which complex lifeforms emerged may have not been that different from our modern oceans.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The water solubility in various phonolite melts was determined experimentally at pressures between 50 and 395 MPa and at temperatures between 850 and 1200 °C. The aim of this study was to elucidate to which extent chemical and physical parameters such as relative amounts of alkali and alkaline earth elements or temperature affect the water solubility. For this purpose a total of 10 different phonolite glasses were prepared. For a series of four glasses, the Na/(Na + K) ratio was varied from 0.2 to 0.8, for another series of four glasses, the (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) ratio was varied from 2.8 to 10.1, while keeping Na/(Na + K) constant at 0.4. For these two series water solubility experiments were performed at 1200 °C and pressures between 50 and 395 MPa in an internally heated pressure vessel. The data show that both chemical variables have rather small effects on the water solubility. For instance, at 2 kbar and 1200 °C an increase in Na/(Na + K) ratio from 0.2 to 0.8 leads to an increase in water solubility of about 0.4 wt.{\%} (5.58 to 5.94 wt.{\%}), while increasing the (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) ratio from 2.8 to 10.1 leads to an increase of about 0.2 wt.{\%} water. The effect of temperature was investigated for two phonolite compositions, representative of Monta{\~{n}}a Blanca, Tenerife, Spain and the Laacher See volcanic complex, East Eifel, Germany at pressures of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 MPa, and temperatures between 850 and 1200 °C. At these conditions both melts exhibit negative temperature dependence ranging from about − 0.1 to − 0.24 wt.{\%} water per 100 °C. The strongest temperature dependence (most negative values) occurs at 150 to 200 MPa and seems to approach zero slightly above 300 MPa.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide and water, being present in the Earth's mantle at concentration levels of tens to hundreds of ppm, greatly lower the peridotite solidus temperature and drastically modify the composition of produced melts. The presence of CO2produces silica-poor, carbonate-rich liquids at the onset of melting, and these liquids shift toward silica rich compositions as the degree of melting increases. Numerous geochemical observations and experimental studies have revealed the complexity of the transition between carbonate-rich and silicate-rich melts. It is characterized by a strongly non-linear evolution and, under specific conditions, by immiscibility. To better constrain this transition, we have used the thermodynamic activity of silica as a probe of the mixing properties between molten carbonate and molten silicate. The activity of silica aSiO2l was calculated for a large number of experimental liquids from two equilibria: olivine-orthopyroxene-melt and immiscible silicate-rich melt-carbonate-rich melt (491 data points ranging from 1 to 14 GPa and 1090 to 1800 °C). We modelled aSiO2l during incipient melting of the peridotite in presence of CO2with a generalized Margules function. Our model reproduces well the silica activity-composition relationships of the experimental database, and can be used to predict the silica content of the melts coexisting with olivine and orthopyroxene. We show that water content and Ca/Mg ratio in the melts have an important influence on the aSiO2l. In contrast to a recent empirical model (Dasgupta et al., 2013), the analysis of the experimental database reveals that the transition from carbonate to silicate melt with decreasing depth should occur abruptly in oceanic mantle. Our model predicts that carbonatitic melts with {\~{}}5 wt.{\%} SiO2can be stabilized from {\~{}}150 km depth, at the onset of incipient melting by "redox melting", up to {\~{}}75 km, above which the liquid evolves abruptly to a carbonated silicate composition ({\textgreater} {\~{}}25 wt.{\%} SiO2). In the cratonic mantle lithosphere, our model predicts that carbonatitic melts are prevailing up to shallow depth, and conflicts the recent model (Russell et al., 2012) of CO2-saturation triggered by orthopyroxene assimilation during kimberlite ascent.},

abstract = {Although it is one of the best-studied layered mafic intrusions in the world, the crystallization sequence of the Skaergaard Intrusion, east Greenland, remains in debate. In particular, it has been argued that the crystallization sequence in the Upper Border Series, which crystallized downwards from the roof of the magma chamber, differs from that in the Layered Series formed at the floor. The proposed deviation would require chemical stratification of the magma, and a reexamination of the crystallization sequence therefore has important implications for understanding the dynamics of the system. Here, we examine a new sample set from the Upper Border Series, combining field observations, petrography and anorthite contents of plagioclase with bulk rock Ti, V, P, Cu and Mn concentrations. We demonstrate that the first phases on the liquidus were plagioclase and olivine followed by augite, then ilmenite and magnetite (simultaneously), sulfides, apatite and finally ferrobustamite (now inverted to hedenbergite). This crystallization sequence represents extreme differentiation along the tholeiitic trend, and it mirrors those at the floor (Layered Series) and walls (Marginal Border Series). We therefore propose a revised subdivision of the Upper Border Series into equivalents of the subzones in the Layered Series denoted by apostrophes (LZa′, LZb′, etc.). Moreover, the first appearance of each of the cumulus phases occurs at similar plagioclase core anorthite contents. The mirror images of the crystallization sequences and the anorthite contents of plagioclase cores in the three series imply that the Skaergaard magma chamber solidified by in situ crystallization along the floor, walls and roof from one, largely homogenous, convecting magma body.},

abstract = {Re—Os and Sm—Nd isotopic data have been obtained for mafic and ultramafic cumulates from the 2700-Ma Stillwater Complex and associated fine-grained sills and dykes, so as to better constrain the geochemical characteristics of Stillwater parental magmas and to trace the source(s) of the precious metals that have been concentrated in the J-M Reef, the major platinum-group element mineral deposit in the complex. Initial Os isotopic compositions (187Os/188Os) for chromitites from the Ultramafic series range from a radiogenic isotopic composition of 0.1321 ($\gamma$Os = +21) for the platinum group element (PGE)-enriched B chromitite seam from the West Fork area to a near-chondritic isotopic composition of 0.1069–0.1135 ($\gamma$Os=−2 to +4.1) for the PGE-poor G and H chromitite seams, respectively, near the middle of the Ultramafic series. Osmium isotopic data for the PGE-rich B chromitite seam are generally isochronous with whole-rock and mineral data for the J-M Reef ($\gamma$Os = + 12 to + 34). Re—Os isotopic data therefore document a contrast between PGE-poor cumulates from the Ultramafic series and PGE-enriched cumulates from both the Ultramafic series and the J-M Reef, suggesting that Os and probably the other PGE were derived from at least two isotopically distinct sources. Moreover, these Re-Os isotopic characteristics correlate with petrogenetic subdivisions of the Stillwater Complex based on field mapping, petrology, REE geochemistry, and Sm—Nd isotope geochemistry. The data are best explained by mixing of two magma types, referred to as U-type and A-type magmas, with differing major element, trace element, and precious metal abundances and isotopic compositions. Although crustally contaminated komatiites can mimic the Os and Nd isotopic characteristics of the U-type magma, the combination of low initial Os isotopic values ($\gamma$Os∼0) with low initial Nd isotopic values ($\epsilon$Nd≦−1), high 207Pb/204Pb for a given 206Pb/204Pb (Wooden et al., 1991), and high (Ce/Yb)n ratios in U-type cumulates and fine-grained sills and dykes is more consistent with the involvement of a Re-poor, but trace-element-enriched portion of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle in the petrogenesis of Stillwater U-type magmas. However, the radiogenic initial Os isotopic compositions of the J-M Reef and other portions of the intrusion with elevated PGE concentrations suggest that A-type parental magmas incorporated Os from radiogenic early Archaean crust. The relatively large range in (Ce/Yb)n, $\gamma$Os, and $\epsilon$Nd values suggests that mixing of geochemically distinct magmas may have been an important process throughout the history of the Stillwater magma chamber. Magma mixing may then explain not only the PGE-enriched J-M Reef but also the anomalous enrichment of the PGE in the B chromitite seam from the West Fork area and the variable values observed in other chromitite seams of the Ultramafic series. The intimate association of these magma types, derived from or modified in the Archaean continental lithosphere, may then be crucial to the formation of magmatic PGE mineral deposits.},

abstract = {We have performed phase equilibrium experiments to determine the pre-eruptive conditions of the largest caldera-forming eruption (∼ 20 km3 of DRE) that has occurred on Tenerife (Canary Islands). The Abrigo ignimbrite is phonolitic and was erupted during the last caldera-forming episode (ca. 190 ka), prior to the construction of the Teide–Pico Viejo active central complex. The Abrigo phonolite contains low amounts of phenocrysts (ca. 7 vol.{\%}), mainly sanidine, biotite, clinopyroxene, and magnetite, with minor amounts of titanite, apatite, and ha{\"{u}}yne. We have investigated pressures from 50 to 250 MPa, temperatures of 700–900 °C, water contents in the melt from 1.5 to ca. 10 wt.{\%}, and oxygen fugacity (fO2) from 1 log unit above the Ni–NiO solid buffer to Quartz–Magnetite–Fayalite. Comparison of the natural and experimental phase proportions and compositions indicates that the phonolite at the roof of the Abrigo magma reservoir was at 130 ± 50 MPa (corresponding to ca. 4–5 km below the surface), 825 ± 25 °C, with 3 ± 1 wt.{\%} dissolved H2O and fO2 at the Ni–NiO buffer ± 1 log unit. This shows that the magma that produced the largest ignimbrite on Tenerife was stored at relatively shallow depths but was water-undersaturated, and its eruption was probably triggered by input of fresh mafic magma. Comparison of the Abrigo phase equilibrium results with those obtained in other phonolitic magmas (e.g., Eifel, Kerguelen, Somma-Vesuvius) shows that the major element and probably fluid composition (H2O, Cl and S) may have a strong effect on the presence or absence of phases and their compositions. Extrapolating phase equilibria results obtained on a specific phonolite to constrain the pre-eruptive conditions of other phonolites should be done with care.},

abstract = {The c. 673 Ma (U–Pb rutile) Amon kimberlites located in northern Baffin Island intruded Late Archean basement rocks of the Rae craton as a subhorizontal sill complex. The Amon sills are part of widespread low-volume, volatile-rich ultramafic magmatism that occurred along the northern and eastern margins of Laurentia, demarcating the temporal and spatial breakout from the Rodinia supercontinent during the Late Neoproterozoic. Numerous other known kimberlite occurrences that are related to these rifting events between c. 680 and 540 Ma are located in mainland Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Labrador, and West Greenland. The magmas that fed the Amon sills are archetypal Group-I kimberlites, based on groundmass mineralogy (e.g. phlogopite, spinel, ilmenite) and bulk-rock compositions, including moderately depleted Sr–Nd–Hf isotope ratios. However, a wide compositional range, together with observed flowage textures, indicates that some magma differentiation occurred during sill emplacement. The Amon samples that are interpreted as parental kimberlite magma compositions overlap published compositions of experimentally derived, near-solidus partial melts of carbonated peridotite between 5 and 10 GPa; that is, equivalent to an origin from 150 to 300 km depth. Furthermore, the Amon kimberlites are characterized by moderately depleted Nd ($\epsilon$Nd(i) = +1{\textperiodcentered}5 to +3{\textperiodcentered}5) and Hf ($\epsilon$Hf(i) = +1{\textperiodcentered}1 to +8{\textperiodcentered}7) isotope compositions, without pronounced isotope decoupling as known from other kimberlite occurrences worldwide. Among the studied Late Neoproterozoic volatile-rich ultramafic magmatic rocks in Laurentia, the Amon kimberlites have Nd–Hf isotope systematics that are similar to those of a previously identified, carbonate-rich, depleted end-member component. This common component is suggested to represent a widespread near-solidus partial melt of volatile-fluxed fertile peridotite within the uppermost convecting mantle beneath the rifting supercraton. Our preferred model for Late Neoproterozoic kimberlite and related magmatism along the rifted margins of Laurentia invokes a combination of redox- and decompression-related low-degree partial melting of convecting upper mantle material that flows beneath rugged topography at the base of thick continental lithosphere. Provided that carbonate metasomatism of lower cratonic mantle is ubiquitous on a global scale, we argue that proto-kimberlitic melt is likely to be constantly present beneath the cratonic roots of supercontinents, and that it is most efficiently extracted during fast and changing plate motions, such as during the assembly and break-up of supercontinents. This idea is supported by the known kimberlite emplacement patterns of the Gondwana–Pangea (510 Ma–Recent) and Rodinia (1300–550 Ma) supercontinent cycles, but it remains difficult to test for older kimberlites and related rocks dating back to c. 3 Ga.},

abstract = {A central issue for understanding platinum group element (PGE) deposits in layered intrusions is whether they formed through gravitational settling or in situ deposition of sulphide-bearing cumulates on the chamber floor. A unique feature pertinent to this issue is the undercutting Merensky Reef (MR) of the Bushveld Complex, which is commonly associated with potholes, roughly circular depressions in which footwall rocks are removed by magmatic erosion. The undercutting MR forms sill-like apophyses of medium- to coarse-grained harzburgite and orthopyroxenite enriched in sulphide and chromite, which extend laterally from pothole margins into the footwall. They vary in thickness from 5 cm to 1–2 m and can be traced away from pothole margins for distances from a few centimetres to dozens of metres (in one case up to 300 m). Locally there may be several (six or more) apophyses of undercutting MR that are vertically stacked within the footwall cumulates in the vicinity of a single pothole. The most telling field, textural and geochemical features of the undercutting MR are as follows: (1) there is no evidence of deformation of igneous layering or rotation of xenoliths associated with these reefs; (2) thin reaction-type selvages of almost pure anorthosite after host leuconorite or mottled anorthosite are commonly developed along both margins of undercutting MR; (3) undercutting MR are mineralogically zoned; thin seams of chromitite are commonly developed along both margins and pass inwards into rocks with decreasing amounts of disseminated chromite; sulphides can be most abundant at the base, along both margins or in the centre of the apophyses; (4) undercutting MR are also compositionally zoned, with rocks displaying either an increase or decrease in whole-rock MgO content from the margins inwards; (5) undercutting MR are highly enriched in PGE, which are mostly controlled by sulphides and chromite, with the grade and tenor being comparable with those of the normal MR. A key inference is that the development of the undercutting MR within footwall rocks, in some cases many metres below a temporary chamber floor, completely eliminates their origin by gravitational settling from the overlying magma. In situ crystallization appears to be the only possible mechanism through which these zoned reefs could be produced. The undercutting MR is interpreted to develop along particularly amenable horizons at pothole margins through thermal/chemical erosion of the footwall rocks by superheated magma, followed by in situ crystallization within the resulting cavities. The cavities behaved as open systems where convection continuously supplied fresh magma, which crystallized from the margins inwards, producing mineralized cumulate rocks. The process may locally be accompanied by redeposition of crystals and sulphide droplets that originally grew in situ, but were torn loose and transported by flowing magma. The highly mineralized undercutting MR of the Bushveld Complex is dramatic confirmation of the hypothesis that high concentrations of PGE in stratiform deposits within layered intrusions can be obtained through in situ crystallization, directly on crystal–liquid interfaces, without processes of gravitational settling.},

abstract = {Detailed observations of the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruptions in Iceland show seismic activity propagating vertically through the entire crust during a ten-week period of volcanic unrest comprising multiple eruption episodes. Systematic changes in magma chemistry suggest a complex magmatic plumbing system, tapping several accumulation zones at different depths containing magma of differing ages and compositions. During the eruption, a systematic downward propagation of seismicity through the crust and into the upper mantle to similar to 30 km depth occurred in a series of steps, each of which preceded an explosive surge in eruption rate. Here we show that the sequence of seismicity and eruptive activity may be explained by the downward propagation of a decompression wave that triggers magma release from progressively deeper sills in the crust. Comparing observations of the downward-propagating seismicity with the decompression of a series of model elastic sills suggests that each sill was 1-10 km(3) in size. Citation: Tarasewicz, J., R. S.

abstract = {The McDermitt volcanic field covers an area of 20,000 km2 in southeastern Oregon and northwestern Nevada and consists of seven large-volume ash flow sheets that vented from 16.1 to 15 Ma ago. The volcanic field is characterized by peralkaline, high-silica rhyolite, and all but one of the sheets are comendites. The ash flow field overlies a 1.5-km-thick section of Miocene Steens volcanic series and Steens Basalt, indicating a minimum age of 16.1 Ma for the Steens Basalt. The Orevada rift, a 200-km-long NNW-striking structure, developed just prior to eruption of the mafic lavas. Each ash flow sheet resulted in the formation of a large collapse caldera along the Orevada rift. The center of the volcanic field is dominated by four overlapping and nested calderas; satellitic to these are three additional calderas. The areas adjacent to the incipient calderas subsided during ash flow eruption. Thickening of the ash flow sheets, monoclinal warping outside the caldera ring fault, and tilting in toward the caldera of blocks bounded by curvilinear faults all indicate regional subsidence prior to caldera collapse. The McDermitt caldera complex is highly mineralized; it contains ore deposits of Hg, Sb, Cs, Li, and U. The peralkaline tuffs have high contents of these elements and were the source rocks from which metals were leached by hydrothermal systems developed during the last stage of caldera-related volcanism.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION ID-TIMS is the acronym for Isotope Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry. This refers to the addition of an isotope tracer to a dissolved sample to make a homogeneous isotopic mixture, and the measurement of isotopic composition of the mixture using a thermal ionization mass spectrometer. The method is one of the most accurate and precise methods of isotopic techniques because it is relatively insensitive to chemical yields or mass spectrometric sensitivity. It is a method very widely applied both in earth and many other areas of science involving the measurement of element or isotope concentrations and isotopic ratios. The ID-TIMS technique was first applied to the U-Th-Pb dating of zircon in the 1950s (Tilton et al. 1955, Wetherill 1956, Tilton et al. 1957), exploiting the general availability to academia of enriched uranium isotopes developed in the 1940s and 1950s related to nuclear energy re-search. ID-TIMS has remained the main foundation to zircon geochronology ever since, in spite of the proliferation of other analytical methodologies. In the past 50 years, many improvements have been made and they have contributed to the maturity and reliability of the method. As a method, it was effectively unchallenged until the 1980s when secondary ionization mass spec-trometry (Anderson and Hinthorne 1972) was further developed and applied to zircon geochro-nology by W. Compston and colleagues at the Australian National University (Compston et al. 1984). The instrument developed by the ANU group (SHRIMP, or Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe) and the associated measurement protocols facilitated measurement of Pb/U isotopic ratios within a small region of a single zircon grain, and it proved to be a powerful tool to address complex age structure of multi-component zircons. In the 1990s, laser ablation quadrupole ICP-MS methods came on stream and offered an alternate way to make intra-grain U-Th-Pb isotopic measurements. The advent of double-focusing ICP-MS instruments has offered much better mea-surement precision compared to quadrupole machines, and while still developing, they have yet to make quite the same impact, though many current laboratories are working to close the gap with SIMS methods. There has been an unfortunate tendency for advocates of TIMS on the one hand and SIMS on the other to unfairly criticize each other's methodology, or at least the ways those methodolo-gies have been applied to zircon geochronology. While this trend has decreased in recent years it is reflected in some of the literature and can give a biased impression of the complementary capabilities of both methods, often ignoring the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative. It is imperative that students of zircon geochronology become more aware of the capabilities of all useful methods, so that when confronted with a problem to solve, they know how to design their measurement experiment. The lack of a comprehensive textbook means we must rely on indi-vidual research and review papers and our own abilities at synthesis to gain a reasonable under-standing of the field. As an alternative, short courses can be very effective at bringing the views of experts together, as this and other volumes (Heaman and Parrish 1991) attempt to do. Parrish and Noble 184 A great range of geochronological problems can be addressed effectively with either ID-TIMS or intra-grain microbeam techniques (SIMS or LA-ICP-MS). While this is the case for many appli-cations, some problems are best-solved using ID-TIMS methods and vice-versa. This chapter de-scribes TIMS methods and it comments on the strengths and weaknesses of method variations, using examples of zircon dating mainly from the literature. Naturally it will pay special attention to those applications where ID-TIMS analysis is preferred, if not essential, and it will portray the field of U-Th-Pb geochronology using ID-TIMS as having a very bright future in modern earth science.},

abstract = {The partitioning of La, Sm, Dy, Ho and Yb between garnet, calcic clinopyroxene, calcic amphibole and andesitic and basaltic liquids has been studied experimentally. Glasses containing one or more REE in concentrations of 500–2000 ppm were crystallized at pressures of 10–35 kbar, and temperatures of 900–1520°C. Water was added to stabilize amphibole and to allow study of partition coefficients over wide temperature ranges. Major element and REE contents of crystal rims and adjacent glass were determined by EPMA, with limits of detection for individual REE of 100–180 ppm. Measured partition coefficients, DREECryst-liq, are independent of REE concentration over the concentration ranges used.

D-values show an inverse dependence on temperature, best illustrated for garnet. At a given temperature, they are almost always higher for equilibria involving andesitic liquid. Garnet shows by far the greatest range of D-values, with e.g. DLa {\textless} 0.05 and DYb {\~{}} 44 for andesitic liquid at 940°C. DYb falls to {\~{}} 12 at 1420°C. DSmGa-liq also correlates negatively with temperature and positively with the grossular content of garnet. Patterns of DreeCryst-Liq for calcic clinopyroxenes and amphiboles are sub-parallel, with D-values for amphibole generally higher. Both individual D-values and patterns for the crystalline phases studied are comparable with those determined for phenocryst-matrix pairs in natural dacites, andesites and basalts.

D-values and patterns are interpreted in terms of the entry of REE3+ cations into mineral structures and liquids of contrasted major element compositions. The significance of the partition coefficients for models of the genesis of andesitic and Hy-normative basaltic magmas is assessed. Most magmas of these types in island arcs are unlikely to be produced by melting of garnet-bearing sources such as eclogite or garnet lherzolite.},

abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-{\`{a}}-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

abstract = {Determining the oxygen fugacity of Earth's silicate mantle is of prime importance because it affects the speciation and mobility of volatile elements in the interior and has controlled the character of degassing species from the Earth since the planet's formation(1). Oxygen fugacities recorded by garnet-bearing peridotite xenoliths from Archaean lithosphere are of particular interest, because they provide constraints on the nature of volatile-bearing metasomatic fluids and melts active in the oldest mantle samples, including those in which diamonds are found(2,3). Here we report the results of experiments to test garnet oxythermobarometry equilibria(4,5) under high-pressure conditions relevant to the deepest mantle xenoliths. We present a formulation for the most successful equilibrium and use it to determine an accurate picture of the oxygen fugacity through cratonic lithosphere. The oxygen fugacity of the deepest rocks is found to be at least one order of magnitude more oxidized than previously estimated. At depths where diamonds can form, the oxygen fugacity is not compatible with the stability of either carbonate-or methane-rich liquid but is instead compatible with a metasomatic liquid poor in carbonate and dominated by either water or silicate melt. The equilibrium also indicates that the relative oxygen fugacity of garnet-bearing rocks will increase with decreasing depth during adiabatic decompression. This implies that carbon in the asthenospheric mantle will be hosted as graphite or diamond but will be oxidized to produce carbonatemelt through the reduction of Fe3+ in silicate minerals during upwelling. The depth of carbonate melt formation will depend on the ratio of Fe3+ to total iron in the bulk rock. This 'redox melting' relationship has important implications for the onset of geophysically detectable incipient melting and for the extraction of carbon dioxide from the mantle through decompressive melting.},

abstract = {The La-Ce systematics has one of the longest half-lifes (T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}=292.5Ga) of radioactive decay systems used in isotope geochemistry. Variations of the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce ratio are expected to be small and the use of Ce as isotopic tracer requires a very precise measurement. Compared to Sm-Nd studies, the La-Ce decay system can provide additional information about the nature of sediments recycled in subduction zones, because unusually large Ce anomalies relative to the neighboring rare earth elements exist in marine sediments such as fish teeth or hydrothermal deposits. Here, we present a chemical purification technique for Ce, and mass spectrometric technique to perform accurate and reproducible analyses of Ce isotopes of natural samples. We report a large set of Ce isotope data including analysis of 2 Ce reference material solutions (AMES and JMC-304), 2 rock standards (BCR-2 and BHVO-2), 2 chondrites (the carbonaceous chondrite Allende and the enstatite chondrite Sahara 97072), 4 mid-ocean ridge basalts, 30 arc lavas from the Martinique Island and 5 oceanic sediments from DSDP-site 144 drilled on the Demerara rise. The long-term, external precision obtained on the AMES reference material is 80ppm (2 s.d., {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce=0.0225732±18, n=89). However, we note an evolution of isotopic ratios measured in static mode over the duration of this study (33months). When the reproducibility is calculated from the AMES reference material measured during the same analytical session, it averages 40ppm. All the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce ratios have been normalized to the AMES value of 0.0225746 (measured in session 7, 2 s.d.=14ppm, n=8), a session during which the chondritic value has been defined and the peak tailing was negligible. The {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce ratio measured for the JMC-304 Ce reference reagent is 0.0225706±9 (2 s.d.=38ppm, n=10). The analytical precision on natural samples is improved by a factor of about 4 in relation to previous studies on island arcs (Tanaka et al., 1987; Shimizu et al., 1992). The {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce ratios of the two chondrites are identical within uncertainty and similar to previous determinations done on other meteorites; the average value is 0.0225654±7 (2 s.d.=32ppm). Martinique samples show a limited but significant range of variations for {\textless}sup{\textgreater}138{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}142{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ce ratios ({\~{}}2 $\epsilon$-units). The latter ratios correlate well with the Nd isotopes and define a binary mixing between a depleted mantle and subducted sediments that could be similar to those drilled at DSDP-site 144 (Leg 14). The Martinique lavas do not define a single curve in the $\epsilon$Ce vs. $\epsilon$Nd diagram, but a band. The apparent scattering can be explained by the involvement of sediments with different Ce isotope compositions and/or variations in the melting process itself such as the effect of melting on the light rare earth element ratios. The Ce isotopic signature of Martinique samples is dominated by the contribution of old terrigeneous sediments. However, according to our mixing models a low contribution of a few percent of marine sediment material in the source of the lavas is undetectable and therefore cannot be definitely excluded. Although the participation of marine sediments in this arc system is not demonstrated, our calculations show that the La-Ce system has a potential as geochemical tracer despite its very long half-life.},

Lamprophyres, emplaced as late-stage dykes, stocks and diatremes, include both alkaline and ultramafic varieties. Many of the latter contain abundant carbonate-rich ocelli. The carbonatites are primarily s{\"{o}}vites and Fe-rich beforsites emplaced as plugs and dykes. Both lamprophyres and carbonatites are characterized by strong, but variable, enrichment in incompatible trace elements (e.g. La 45−7232 ppm; Nb 89–1961 ppm; Sr 700–43 000 ppm), and variable but coherent initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.70351–0.70468), 143Nd/144Nd (0.51244–0.51266) and Pb isotope ratios (e.g. 206Pb/204Pb = 17.77–19.99). Individual lamprophyre types show distinct, but restricted, ranges in isotopes and incompatible element ratios (Zr/Nb = 0.9–2.0; Y/Nb = 0.15–0.34; La/Ybn = 20–58), indicating derivation from a trace element enriched, heterogeneous mantle source. Lamprophyres and carbonatites found within the same complexes have similar isotope ratios, indicating derivation from a common source. Isotope and trace element variations, coupled with the temporal and spatial association with the palaeoposition of the Tristan plume, are thought to indicate that the Damaraland lamprophyre and carbonatite magmatism formed as a consequence of melting of metasomatic vein material introduced into an isotopically depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle by alkaline melts or fluids derived from the upwelling Tristan mantle plume at the time of continental break-up. },

The Re–Os isotopic data, together with the PGE concentrations, demonstrate that beneath the Archean continental crust of the eastern North China Craton, Archean lithospheric mantle of spinel- to diamond-facies existed without apparent compositional stratification during the Paleozoic. The Mesozoic and Cenozoic basalt-borne peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths, on the other hand, show geochemical features indicating metasomatic enrichment, along with a large range of the Re–Os isotopic model ages from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic. These features indicate that lithospheric transformation or refertilization through melt-peridotite interaction could be the primary mechanism for compositional changes during the Phanerozoic, rather than delamination or thermal-mechanical erosion, despite the potential of these latter processes to play an important role for the loss of garnet-facies mantle. A fresh garnet lherzolite xenolith from the Yangtze Block has a Re depletion age of ∼1.04 Ga, much younger than overlying Archean crustal rocks but the same Re depletion ages as spinel lherzolite xenoliths from adjacent Mesozoic basalts, indicating Neoproterozoic resetting of the Re–Os system in the South China Craton.},

abstract = {Forecasting future eruptions of Vesuvius is an important challenge for volcanologists, as its reawakening could threaten the lives of 700,000 people living near the volcano. Critical to the evaluation of hazards associated with the next eruption is the estimation of the depth of the magma reservoir, one of the main parameters controlling magma properties and eruptive style. Petrological studies have indicated that during past activity, magma chambers were at depths between 3 and 16 km (refs 3–7). Geophysical surveys have imaged some levels of seismic attenuation, the shallowest of which lies at 8–9 km depth, and these have been tentatively interpreted as levels of preferential magma accumulation. By using experimental phase equilibria, carried out on material from four main explosive events at Vesuvius, we show here that the reservoirs that fed the eruptive activity migrated from 7–8 km to 3–4 km depth between the ad 79 (Pompeii) and ad 472 (Pollena) events. If data from the Pomici di Base event 18.5 kyr ago and the 1944 Vesuvius eruption are included, the total upward migration of the reservoir amounts to 9–11 km. The change of preferential magma ponding levels in the upper crust can be attributed to differences in the volatile content and buoyancy of ascending magmas, as well as to changes in local stress field following either caldera formation or volcano spreading. Reservoir migration, and the possible influence on feeding rates, should be integrated into the parameters used for defining expected eruptive scenarios at Vesuvius.},

abstract = {The viability of quantum communication schemes rely on sending quantum states of light over long distances. However, transmission loss can degrade the signal strength, adding noise. Heralded noiseless amplification of a quantum signal can provide a solution by enabling longer direct transmission distances and by enabling entanglement distillation. The central idea of heralded noiseless amplification—a conditional modification of the probability distribution over photon number of an optical quantum state—is suggestive of a parallel with weak measurement: in a weak measurement, learning partial information about an observable leads to a conditional back-action of a commensurate size. Here we experimentally investigate the application of weak, or variable-strength, measurements to the task of heralded amplification, by using a quantum logic gate to weakly couple a small single-optical-mode quantum state (the signal) to an ancilla photon (the meter). The weak measurement is carried out by choosing the measurement basis of the meter photon and, by conditioning on the meter outcomes, the signal is amplified. We characterise the gain of the amplifier as a function of the measurement strength, and use interferometric methods to show that the operation preserves the coherence of the signal.},

abstract = {The two parallel chains of Hawaiian volcanoes ('Loa' and 'Kea') are known to have statistically different but overlapping radiogenic isotope characteristics. This has been explained by a model of a concentrically zoned mantle plume, where the Kea chain preferentially samples a more peripheral portion of the plume. Using high-precision lead isotope data for both centrally and peripherally located volcanoes, we show here that the two trends have very little compositional overlap and instead reveal bilateral, non-concentric plume zones, probably derived from the plume source in the mantle. On a smaller scale, along the Kea chain, there are isotopic differences between the youngest lavas from the Mauna Kea and Kilauea volcanoes, but the 550-thousand-year-old Mauna Kea lavas are isotopically identical to Kilauea lavas, consistent with Mauna Kea's position relative to the plume, which was then similar to that of present-day Kilauea. We therefore conclude that narrow (less than 50 kilometres wide) compositional streaks, as well as the larger-scale bilateral zonation, are vertically continuous over tens to hundreds of kilometres within the plume.},

@article{Mysen1982,
abstract = {The structure of melts in binary metal oxide-silica systems may be described in terms of monomers, dimers, chains, sheets, and three-dimensional network structures. For the bulk compositions between orthosilicate and tectosilicate, three well-defined ranges may be distinguished. For bulk nonbridging oxygen per silicon (NBO/Si) of about 2 or less, monomers, dimers, and chains coexist. In the range between metasilicate and disilicate there is usually a combination of monomers, chains, and sheets. Sheets are, however, uncommon or absent in systems where the field strength of the metal cation exceeds that of Mg2+. In those cases, monomers, chains, and three-dimensional network units coexist. In the bulk compositional range of NBO/Si ≳1, sheets, chains, and three-dimensional network structures coexist. In all systems the cations of high field strength show a preference for the most depolymerized structural units. Aluminum and probably ferric iron are tetrahedrally coordinated when charge balanced by a monovalent or divalent cation. Aluminate complexes thus formed show a preference for the most polymerized structural units in the melt. The degree of preference increases with decreasing field strength of the charge-balancing cation. Ferrite complexes may form separate (MFe)4+-O or (M0.5Fe)4+-O clusters in the melts. Titanium and phosphorus are always tetrahedrally coordinated. These cations do not substitute significantly for Si4+ in tetrahedral coordination, but form separate clusters. The anionic structural model described above is consistent with viscosity and expansivity data for melts on binary metal oxide-silica joins. The phase equilibrium data, such as the position of liquidus boundaries between mineral phases of different degress of polymerization on binary metal oxide-silica joins, may be explained with the melt structure model. The observed expansion of immiscible liquid volumes on MO-SiO2 joins with increasing field strength of the M cation is in accord with the enhanced stability of three-dimensional network units in the melts as a function of increased field strength of the metal cation. Most volatile-free natural magmatic liquids will contain chain, sheet, and three-dimensional structural units. The proportion of sheet units in magmas with the same ratio of nonbridging oxygens to tetrahedral cations will decrease with increasing M2+/M+. The proportion of three-dimensional structural units increases at the expense of chain and sheet units as the magma becomes more acidic. On the basis of the observed relationships between melt structure and physical properties the decreased compressibility and viscosity of basic magma compared with acidic magma may be explained. Application of this structural model to natural magma also explains why the pressure dependence of the viscosity of basic magmas is smaller than that of andesitic magmas.},

abstract = {Kimberlites from Southern Africa, along with their low-Cr megacrysts, have unusual Hf–Nd isotopic characteristics. Group I and Transitional kimberlites define arrays trending oblique to, and well below, the Nd–Hf isotope ‘mantle array', defined by oceanic basalts, i.e. they have negative Hf values. Group I kimberlites have Hf values varying from –1.2 to –10.1. Low-Cr megacryst suites from individual Group I kimberlites have compositions that overlap those of their host kimberlites. The trend for all Group I kimberlite megacrysts (Hf values –1.0 to –9.0) shows a striking correspondence to that of the Group I kimberlite field. Group II kimberlites and their low-Cr megacrysts plot on or close to the mantle Nd–Hf array (Hf values 3.6 to –2.6). The data indicate a genetic link between kimberlites and the low-Cr megacryst suite. The negative Hf characteristics of Group I kimberlites and their megacrysts require a source component that is ancient ({\textgreater}1 Ga), and has evolved with low time-integrated Lu/Hf relative to Sm/Nd. Our preferred option is that this component originates beneath the lithosphere, from a reservoir of ancient, deeply subducted oceanic basalt that became incorporated into the convecting mantle source region for Group I and Transitional kimberlites.},

abstract = {Liquid–liquid partitioning of 42 elements between synthetic silicate melts and immiscible fluoride, chloride, carbonate, phosphate and sulfate liquids was studied at temperatures of 650–1100 °C, pressures 72–100 MPa, with 0–11 wt.{\%} H2O. One series of experiments was performed in a rotating internally-heated autoclave where separation of the immiscible liquids was assisted by centrifugal forces. An analogous series of experiments was done in static rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels. The experimentally determined liquid–liquid distribution coefficients (D's) vary over several orders of magnitude, as a result of variable Coulombic interactions between cations and anions. For alkaline, alkaline earth and rare earth elements ther is a strong and systematic dependence of the liquid/liquid D values on the ionic potential Z/r for all the examined systems. In contrast, highly charged cations (e.g., HFSE) show no systematic relationships between the D's and Z/r.
New experimental constraints on the carbonate/silicate liquid–liquid D values presented here confirm that rare metals such as Nb, Zr, REE, Th and U concentrate in silicate liquids, and therefore carbonatites that carry economical rare metal mineralization are not likely to have formed by liquid immiscibility. The comparison between experimentally-determined carbonate–silicate liquid–liquid D values and bulk-rock natrocarbonatite vs. nephelinite compositions at the Oldoinyo Lengai in Tanzania reveals significant discrepancies for Cs, Rb, Ba, Be, Zn, heavy REE, Ti, Mo and W, thus rendering a simple, one-stage immiscibility model for Oldoinyo Lengai questionable.},

abstract = {Explosive volcanism has dominated the large phonolitic shield volcano of Tenerife, the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice, for the last 1.5 m.y. Pyroclastic deposits of the Bandas del Sur Formation are exposed along the southern flanks, and record the last two of at least three long-term cycles of caldera-forming explosive eruptions. Each cycle began with flank fissure eruptions of alkali basalt lava, followed by minor eruptions of basanite to phonotephrite lavas. Minor phonotephritic to phonolitic lava effusions also occurred on the flanks of the edifice during the latter stages of the second explosive cycle. Non-welded plinian fall deposits and ignimbrites are the dominant explosive products preserved on the southern flanks. Of these, a significant volume has been dispersed offshore. Many pyroclastic units of the second explosive cycle exhibit compositional zonation. Banded pumice occurs in most units of the third (youngest) explosive cycle, and ignimbrites typically contain mixed phenocryst assemblages, indicating the role of magma mixing{\&}sol;mingling prior to eruption. At least four major eruptions of the third cycle began with phreatomagmatic activity, producing lithic-poor, accretionary lapilli-bearing fallout and{\&}sol;or surge deposits. The repeated, brief phase of phreatomagmatism at the onset of these eruptions is interpreted as reflecting an exhaustive water supply, probably a small caldera lake that was periodically established during the third cycle. Accidental syenite becomes an increasingly important lithic clast type in ignimbrites up-sequence, and is interpreted as recording the progressive development of a plutonic complex beneath the summit caldera.Successive eruptions during each explosive cycle increased in volume, with the largest eruption occurring at the end of the cycle. More than ten major explosive eruptions vented moderately large volumes (1−{\&}ges;10 km3) of phonolitic magma during the last two cycles. Culminating each explosive cycle was the emplacement of relatively large volume ({\textgreater}5−10 km3) ignimbrites with coarse, vent-derived lithic breccias, interpreted to record a major phase of caldera collapse. In the extracaldera record, explosive cycles are separated by ∼0.2 m.y. periods of non-explosive activity. Repose periods were characterized by erosion, remobilization of pyroclastic deposits by discharge events, and pedogenesis. The current period of non-explosive activity is characterized by the construction of the Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanic complex within the summit caldera. This suggests that eruptive hiatuses in the extracaldera record may reflect effusive activity and stratovolcano or shield-building phases within the summit caldera. Alternating effusive and explosive cycles have thus been important in the volcanic evolution of the Las Ca{\~{n}}adas edifice.},

abstract = {Trace element analysis of Phlegrean Fields volcanic products shows that they belong to a homogeneous series whose evolution is due mainly to fractional crystallization. However quantitative modelling of crystal fractionation using measured mineral/groundmass and computed bulk distribution coefficients singles out K, Sb, Cl and F as elements which are selectively enriched in the differentiation process with respect to proven hygromagmaphile (HYG) elements. This "anomalous" enrichment involving elements that are easily transported in a magmatic fluid phase is thought to be due to percolation of such a fluid through a stored magma body. This enrichment is strongest in products resulting from protracted differentiation (trachybasalts-latites). Isotopic data from the literature are reinterpreted in terms of this model and show good agreement. Trace elements concentrations in clinopyroxenes provide evidence that complex differentiation paths were followed to produce latitic magmas. Their origin by mixing of magmas from different parentages is not indicated by the data. However, mixing of batches of the same parentage but of different degree of evolution seems likely. Because HYG elements ratios are not modified in the evolution of the magmas, they record these ratios in the partial melting zone. For example, the Th/Ta ratio in the source areas of the magmas has apparently been quite heterogeneous. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Luminescent spectra of Eu3+-doped sol–gel glasses have been analyzed during the densification process and compared according to the presence or not of aluminum as a codoping ion. A transition temperature from hydrated to dehydroxyled environments has been found different for doped and codoped samples. However, only slight modifications have been displayed from luminescence measurements beyond this transition. To support the experimental analysis, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to model the doped and codoped glass structures. Despite no evidence of rare earth clustering reduction due to aluminum has been found, the modeled structures have shown that the luminescent ions are mainly located in aluminum-rich domains. The synthesis of both experimental and numerical analyses has lead us to interpret the aluminum effect as responsible for differences in structure of the luminescent sites rather than for an effective dispersion of the rare earth ions.},

abstract = {Regional geological mapping of the glaciated surface of northwestern Victoria Island in the western Canadian Arctic revealed an anomalous structure in otherwise flat-lying Neoproterozoic and lower Paleozoic carbonate rocks, located south of Richard Collinson Inlet. The feature is roughly circular in plan view, approximately 25 km in diameter, and characterized by quaquaversal dips of approximately 45°, decreasing laterally. The core of the feature also exhibits local vertical dips, low-angle reverse faults, and drag folds. Although brecciation was not observed, shatter cones are pervasive in all lithologies in the central area, including 723 Ma old dikes that penetrate Neoproterozoic limestones. Their abundance decreases distally, and none was observed in surrounding, horizontally bedded strata. This circular structure is interpreted as a deeply eroded meteorite impact crater of the complex type, and the dipping strata as the remnants of the central uplift. The variation in orientation and shape of shatter cones point to variably oriented stresses with the passage of the shock wave, possibly related to the presence of pore water in the target strata as well as rock type and lithological heterogeneities, especially bed thickness. Timing of impact is poorly constrained. The youngest rocks affected are Late Ordovician (approximately 450 Ma) and the impact structure is mantled by undisturbed postglacial sediments. Regional, hydrothermal dolomitization of the Ordovician limestones, possibly in the Late Devonian (approximately 360 Ma), took place before the impact, and widespread WSW–ENE-trending normal faults of probable Early Cretaceous age (approximately 130 Ma) apparently cross-cut the impact structure.},

abstract = {For many years, our understanding of the behavior of the REE in hydrothermal systems was based on semi-empirical estimates involving extrapolation of thermodynamic data obtained at 25????C (Haas et al., 1995; Wood, 1990a). Since then, a substantial body of experimental data has accumulated on the stability of aqueous complexes of the REE. These data have shown that some of the predictions of Haas et al. (1995) are accurate, but others may be in error by several orders of magnitude. However, application of the data in modeling hydrothermal transport and deposition of the REE has been severely hampered by the lack of data on the thermodynamic properties of even the most common REE minerals. The discrepancies between the predictions of Haas et al. (1995) and experimental determinations of the thermodynamic properties of aqueous REE species, together with the paucity of data on the stability of REE minerals, raise serious questions about the reliability of some models that have been proposed for the hydrothermal mobility of these critical metals. In this contribution, we review a body of high-temperature experimental data collected over the past 15 years on the stability of REE aqueous species and minerals. Using this new thermodynamic dataset, we re-evaluate the mechanisms responsible for hydrothermal transport and deposition of the REE. We also discuss the mechanisms that can result in REE fractionation during their hydrothermal transport and deposition. Our calculations suggest that in hydrothermal solutions, the main REE transporting ligands are chloride and sulfate, whereas fluoride, carbonate, and phosphate likely play an important role as depositional ligands. In addition to crystallographic fractionation, which is based on the differing affinity of mineral structures for the REE, our models suggest that the REE can be fractionated hydrothermally due to the differences in the stability of the LREE and HREE as aqueous chloride complexes.},

abstract = {We have determined the partition coefficients of a large number of trace elements between CaTiO3 perovskite and anhydrous silicate melts at atmospheric pressure and 3 GPa. Determination of the concentration limits of Henry's law behaviour in the CaO-Al2O3–SiO2–TiO2 system reveals that the incorporation of rare earth elements (REE) and tetravalent large ion lithophile elements (LILE4+ such as U and Th) at the Ca-site of CaTiO3 perovskite occurs with charge compensation through Ca-vacancy formation rather than by coupled substitution of Al for Ti. When melt composition is varied, we find that partition coefficients for REE and Th are strong functions of the CaO content of the melt. The observed trends are in excellent agreement with those predicted from the Ca-vacancy model. Given that they adopt the same crystal structure and have similar trace element partitioning behaviour, CaTiO3 perovskite and the deep mantle phase CaSiO3 perovskite can be considered analogous to one another. When the analogy is pursued in detail, we find that partitioning into both phases follows the composition-dependence predicted by the Ca-vacancy model. Thus, substitution of REE, U4+ and Th into CaSiO3 in the lower mantle also occurs with Ca-vacancy formation to balance charge. Furthermore when 2+, 3+ and 4+ partition coefficients for both phases are plotted as functions of CaO melt content, the trends for CaSiO3 and CaTiO3 appear to be continuous. This surprising result means that partitioning into Ca-perovskite is independent of pressure and temperature and also of whether or not the host is CaSiO3 or CaTiO3. One implication is that CaSiO3 crystallising from a peridotitic magma ocean may have partition coefficients for Th and U up to about 400. Crystallisation and sequestration of as little as 0.25 volume{\%} of this phase in the lower mantle early in earth history would make a significant contribution to current mantle heat production.},

abstract = {The silicic peralkaline volcanoes of the East African Rift are some of the least studied volcanoes on Earth. Here we bring together new constraints from fieldwork, remote sensing, geochronology and geochemistry to present the first detailed account of the eruptive history of Aluto, a restless silicic volcano located in a densely populated section of the Main Ethiopian Rift. Prior to the growth of the Aluto volcanic complex (before 500 ka) the region was characterized by a significant period of fault development and mafic fissure eruptions. The earliest volcanism at Aluto built up a trachytic complex over 8 km in diameter. Aluto then underwent large-volume ignimbrite eruptions at 316 ± 19 ka and 306 ± 12 ka developing a {\~{}} 42 km2 collapse structure. After a hiatus of {\~{}} 250 ka, a phase of post-caldera volcanism initiated at 55 ± 19 ka and the most recent eruption of Aluto has a radiocarbon age of 0.40 ± 0.05 cal. ka BP. During this post-caldera phase highly-evolved peralkaline rhyolite lavas, ignimbrites and pumice fall deposits have erupted from vents across the complex. Geochemical modelling is consistent with rhyolite genesis from protracted fractionation ({\textgreater} 80{\%}) of basalt that is compositionally similar to rift-related basalts found east of the complex. Based on the style and volume of recent eruptions we suggest that silicic eruptions occur at an average rate of 1 per 1000 years, and that future eruptions of Aluto will involve explosive emplacement of localised pumice cones and effusive obsidian coulees of volumes in the range 1–100 × 106 m3.},

abstract = {The almost unknown Ambohimirahavavy ring complex in the Cenozoic alkaline province of northwestern Madagascar has recently attracted considerable interest because of the discovery of important rare-metal mineralization. The complex consists of arc-shaped bodies made up of silica-under- and -oversaturated syenites and extremely evolved peralkaline granitic dykes, as well as several mafic to felsic volcanic units, including basalt, phonolite and trachyte, all of which have an alkaline affinity. Uranium-lead zircon ages of 24.2. ±. 0.6. Ma and 23.5. ±. 6.8. Ma have been obtained for nepheline syenites and peralkaline granitic dykes, respectively, which, together with field data and ages of neighboring complexes, support emplacement controlled by regional lithospheric structures, rather than an evolving hot spot.Whole-rock major and trace-element and Sr-Nd isotopic data for the mafic suite suggest that the parental melt of this complex was generated by low degrees of melting of a metasomatized mantle source with residual amphibole. Fractional crystallization of this alkali basaltic melt likely produced the silica-undersaturated suite. We propose that the silica-oversaturated suite evolved from the undersaturated melt after contamination of the latter by crustal material. Further evolution to peralkaline compositions in both suites is attributed mainly to plagioclase and alkali feldspar segregation.Nepheline and feldspar compositions, as well as considerations of mineral equilibria among mafic silicates and Fe-Ti oxide minerals indicate crystallization temperatures of 1000 to 700. °C and an oxygen fugacity of 0.4 to 0.8. log units below the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer at 1. kbar for the silica-undersaturated melt, and temperatures of 860 to 570. °C and an oxygen fugacity of 1.5 to 3.8. log units below FMQ for the oversaturated syenitic melt. The undersaturated melt evolved towards a more peralkaline composition. Crystallization of arfvedsonite plus aegirine further reduced the melt the evolution of which ended with fluid exsolution. At late stages of crystallization, the oversaturated melt departed from the reducing trend of the undersaturated melt, evolving towards high oxygen fugacity. Very late exsolution of the fluid permitted concentration of the HFSE in the last stages of magmatic evolution with local production of low-temperature pegmatitic phases extremely enriched in these elements. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Plagioclase crystallization from a hydrous hawaiitic melt was studied by various methods. The temperature of metastable liquidus extension (temperature of plagioclase equilibrium with the melt of the given composition) was estimated as 1070 ± 5°C at PH2O = 600 bar and f O2 ≈ NNO. This is 20-25°C higher than the value calculated by the MELTS code. Plagioclase growth rate at an undercooling of 10-15° is about 1.5 × 10-5 cm/s. It was shown that iron content in plagioclase increases with increasing undercooling, and lath-shaped quench plagioclase crystals contain up to 2.0-3.5 wt {\%} FeO. Iron content in recrystallized plagioclase is about 0.5 wt {\%}, which is close to that of the intrusive plagioclase that was used as a seed. The experimental plagioclase crystals that grew during degassing of water-saturated hawaiitic melt are similar to natural plagioclase from the lavas of Mount Etna Volcano with respect to iron content (0.5-0.8 wt {\%}) and albite mole fraction. The crystal size distribution of plagioclase in the hawaiites of Etna shows an exponential segment for grain sizes about L {\textless} 0.6 mm. According to our experiments, this segment could correspond to crystallization coupled with degassing. The crystals could attain the critical size during the ascent of hawaiitic magma from the level of water saturation to the surface within 3-5 h. An increase in the population density toward small plagioclase crystal sizes could correspond to the increasing rate of nucleation at relatively low overcooling due to the melt degassing. The analysis of the IR spectra of hawaiitic glasses demonstrated that dissolution of more than 1 wt {\%} water results in melt depletion in feldspar-like structural units (four-membered aluminosilicate rings).},

abstract = {Isobaric and isothermal experiments were performed to investigate the effect of melt composition on the partitioning of trace elements between titanite (CaTiSiO5) and a range of different silicate melts. Titanite-melt partition coefficients for 18 trace elements were determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses of experimental run products. The partition coefficients for the rare earth elements and for Th, Nb, and Ta reveal a strong influence of melt composition on partition coefficients, whereas partition coefficients for other studied monovalent, divalent and most quadrivalent (i.e., Zr, Hf) cations are not significantly affected by melt composition. The present data show that the influence of melt composition may not be neglected when modelling trace element partitioning. It is argued that it is mainly the change of coordination number and the regularity of the coordination space of trace elements in the melt structure that controls partition coefficients in our experiments. Furthermore, our data also show that the substitution mechanism by which trace elements are incorporated into titanite crystals may be of additional importance in this context.},

abstract = {Textural and compositional variations of apatite from the plutonic Il??maussaq complex in South Greenland and its surrounding country rocks track magmatic and metasomatic processes. Detailed back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging reveals various types of apatite textures including (i) growth zonation (concentric, oscillatory as well as sector zonation) formed during magmatic differentiation, (ii) resorption and overgrowth textures due to fluid/melt induced metasomatic overprint of precursor apatite and (iii) replacement textures indicating the destabilization of apatite in favor of monazite.In the least evolved rocks of the Il??maussaq complex, apatite incorporates rare earth elements and Y (REY) mainly via the coupled substitution Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}+P{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=REY{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}+Si{\textless}sup{\textgreater}4+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. In the more evolved peralkaline rocks and in metasomatically overprinted rocks, however, the coupled substitution 2 Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=REY{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}+Na{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} becomes increasingly relevant, and apatite incorporates successively more LREE compared to HREE as shown by increasing (La/Gd){\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and (Gd/Yb){\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ratios. Similarly, at the contact between the Il??maussaq rocks and the granitic country rocks, the metasomatic effect of the emplacement of the Il??maussaq melts is preserved in partly resorbed precursor apatite, which is overgrown by REY-enriched apatite with higher (La/Gd){\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and (Gd/Yb){\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ratios compared to apatite from granites more distant from the contact.This study shows, that apatite textures and compositions are suitable to track both primary magmatic and later fluid-present metasomatic processes. The incorporation of REY in apatite is not only dependent on the amount of REY present but also depends largely on Na activity in the apatite-precipitating melts and fluids.},

abstract = {Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) can have a significant global climatic effect as monitored by sedimentary trace and isotopic compositions that record paleo-seawater/atmosphere variations. Improved U-Pb dating (with better than 0.1 Myr resolution) for several LIPs is confirming a long-proposed mass extinction-LIP link. The most dramatic climatic effect is global warming due to greenhouse-gases from LIPs. Subsequent cooling (and even global glaciations) can be caused by CO2drawdown through weathering of LIP-related basalts, and/or by sulphate aerosols. Additional kill mechanisms that can be associated with LIPs include oceanic anoxia, ocean acidification, sea level changes, toxic metal input, essential nutrient decrease, producing a complex web of catastrophic environmental effects. Notably, the size of a LIP is not the only important factor in contributuing to environmental impact. Of particular significance are the rate of effusion, and the abundance of LIP-produced pyroclastic material and volatile fluxes that reach the stratosphere. While flood basalt degassing (CO2, SO2, halogens) is important (and is also from associated silicic volcanism), a significant amount of these gases are released from volatile-rich sedimentary rocks (e.g. evaporites and coal horizons) heated by the intrusive component of LIPs. Feedbacks are important, such as global warming leading to destabilization of clathrates, consequent release of further greenhouse gases, and greater global warming. In the broadest sense LIPs can affect (or even induce) shifts between Icehouse, Greenhouse and Hothouse climatic states. However, the specific effects, their severity, and their time sequencing is specific to each LIP. Based on the robust array of environmental effects due to LIPs, as demonstrated in the Phanerozoic record, it is suggested that LIP events represent useful time markers in the Precambrian Era as proxies for some significant global environmental changes that are preserved in the sedimentary record.},

abstract = {The viscosities of fluorine- and water-bearing melts based on albite composition have been determined at 7.5, 15 and 22.5 kbar by the falling-sphere method. All melt viscosities decrease isothermally with increasing pressure. At 1200°C the viscosity of the fluorine-bearing melt (albite + 5.8 wt.{\%} fluorine substituted for oxygen, denoted AbF2O-1) decreases from 5000 ± 750 P at 7.5 kbar to 1600 ± 240 P at 22.5 kbar. At 1400°C the viscosity of this melt decreases from 1300 ± 200 P at 7.5 kbar to 430 ± 65 P at 22.5 kbar. At 1400°C the viscosity of albite + 2.79 wt.{\%} water (denoted AbH2O) decreases from 650 ± 100 P at 7.5 kbar to 400 ± 60 P at 22.5 kbar. Fluorine (as F2O-1) and water strongly decrease the viscosity of albite melt over the entire range of investigated pressures. The ratio of the effects of 5.8 wt.{\%} fluorine [ F (F + O) molar = 0.10] and 2.79 wt.{\%} water [ OH (OH + O) molar = 0.10] on the log of melt viscosity [ $\Delta$ log $\eta$(AbF2O-1) $\Delta$ log $\eta$(AbH2O)] equals 0.90 ± 0.05, 0.84 ± 0.05 and 0.97 ± 0.05 at 7.5, 15 and 22.5 kbar, respectively. Comparison with available data on the high-pressure viscosity of albite melt indicates that both F2O-1 and H2O maintain their viscosity-reducing roles to lower crustal pressures. The difference between the viscosities of melts of albite, AbF2O-1 and AbH2O, may be explained in terms of the relatively depolymerized structures of AbF2O-1 and AbH2O melts. The depolymerization of albite melt by the addition of water results from the formation of SiOH bonds. The depolymerization of albite melt by F2O-1 substitution results from the formation of non-bridging oxygens associated with network-modifying aluminum cations that are formed upon fluorine solution. The strong viscosity-reducing effects of water and fluorine in albite melt at pressures corresponding to the mid- to lower continental crust indicate that these two components will strongly influence the dynamic behavior of anatectic melts during initial magma coalescence and restite-melt segregation. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {A proton microprobe was used to measure partition coefficients for Rb, Sr, Ba, Y, Zr, Nb and Ta between experimentally produced amphiboles and hydrous basaltic melts. A limited amount of data was also obtained for the distribution of trace elements in clinopyroxene and mica. Partition coefficients for trace elements in amphibole and basanite melts are (at 1$\sigma$): Rb 0.34 ± 0.14; Sr 0.33 ± 0.07; Ba 0.46 ± 0.16; Y 0.6 ± 0.2; Ti 0.95 ± 0.19; Zr 0.25 ± 0.06; Nb 0.08 ± 0.01; and Ta 0.09 ± 0.03. Only small, generally non-systematic differences in these values are observed with variation in pressure (10-20 kbar) and temperature (1000-1050°C), but large differences accompany changes in melt composition and F content. For a (F-free) basaltic andesite melt, at 20 kbar and 950°C, amphibole/melt distribution coefficients are: Rb 0.07 ± 0.01; Sr 0.35 ± 0.03; Y 1.3 ± 0.1; Ti 1.75 ± 0.12; Zr 0.35 ± 0.06; Nb 0.21 ± 0.01; and Ta 0.19 ± 0.02. The data support proposals that residual amphibole in mantle source regions for some nephelinites explains their relatively high HFSE/LILE ratios. In contrast, the data do not favour amphibole as the cause of characteristically low HFSE/LILE observed in mantle-derived island arc basalts. The increases in partition coefficients (excepting for Rb) for the more SiO2-rich melt are consistent with similar trends observed in phenocryst-matrix pairs from volcanic rocks. The compositional dependence of HFSE partition coefficients increases with increasing field strength. This trend can be related to steric effects within polymerised aluminosilicate units of the melt phase. Amphiboles grown from F-enriched melts are relatively depleted in TiO2, Al2O3, CaO and incompatible trace elements. These effects are only large, however, at high F concentrations ({\textgreater} 2 wt{\%}). The effects of F on incompatible elements will be least in melts containing high concentrations of Al2O3, FeO, MgO and CaO. For these reasons, it is unlikely that concentrations of HFSE and other incompatible elements in natural magmas (with the possible exception of some rare F-and SiO2-rich magmas) are significantly affected by F. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Fluids play a critical role in subduction zones and arc magmatism. At shallow levels in subduction zones ({\textless}40 kilometers depth), expulsion of large volumes of pore waters and CH4-H2O fluids produced by diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic reactions affect the thermal and rheological evolution of the accretionary prism and provide nutrients for deep-sea biological communities. At greater depths, H2O and CO2 released by metamorphic reactions in the subducting oceanic crust may alter the bulk composition in the overlying mantle wedge and trigger partial melting reactions. The location and conse-quences of fluid production in subduction zones can be constrained by consideration of phase diagrams for relevant bulk compositions in conjunction with fluid and rock pressure-temperature-time paths predicted by numerical heat-transfer models. Partial melting of subducting, amphibole-bearing oceanic crust is predicted only within several tens of million years of the initiation of subduction in young oceanic lithosphere. In cooler subduction zones, partial melting appears to occur primarily in the overlying mantle wedge as a result of fluid infiltration.},

abstract = {Long basaltic lava flows (over 100 km in length) require specific emplacement conditions to prevent the lava from freezing as it is transported to the flow front. The minimum dimensions of the lava transport systems (tubes, channels, or sheets) require that the flow have a volume greater than several cubic kilometers. Long lava flows are emplaced on slopes less than 10{\%} (∼5°) and the lava being transported must cool at a rate less than 0.5°C/km. We show that there are two modes by which thermally efficient, long distance lava transport can be achieved: (1) “rapid” emplacement in which the lava flows so quickly that it does not cool excessively despite large heat losses and (2) “insulated” emplacement in which heat loss is minimized. We here estimate cooling in the rapid mode using a modified version of a previously published thermal model for aa flows and find that, for a range of inputs appropriate for subaerial terrestrial condition, effusion rates of at least 3100 to 11000 m3/s, channel flow velocities in excess of 4–12 m/s, and minimum channel depths of 3–17 m are required for basaltic flows {\textgreater}100 km in length. For emplacement in the insulated mode, we construct a very simple heat balance model for roofed sheet flows which shows that extremely long sheet-fed flows are possible with velocities as low as 0.2–1.4 m/s, flow thickness of 6–23 m, and minimum effusion rates of the order of 50–7100 m3/s. Also, earlier work has suggested that tube-fed flows more than 100 km long can be produced at effusion rates as low as several tens of m3/s and with tube diameters of a few tens of meters. We argue that flows emplaced in the rapid mode should be morphologically similar to channel-fed aa flows while those emplaced in the insulated mode should be similar to tube-fed or sheet-like inflated pahoehoe flows. This leads to several field criteria for distinguishing these two modes of emplacement in ancient lava sequences. Additional constraints on the emplacement of long lava flows are expected from the continued study of the formation and evolution of lava channels, tubes, and sheets.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of the degassing pattern of sulphur, chlorine and fluorine during ascent and eruption of basaltic magmas is still fragmental and mainly limited to water-poor basalts. Here we model and discuss the pressure-related degassing behaviour of S, Cl and F during ascent, differentiation and extrusion of H2O-CO2-rich alkali basalt on Mount Etna (Sicily) as a function of eruptive styles. Our modelling is based on published and new melt inclusion data for dissolved volatiles (CO2, H2O, S, Cl, F) in quenched explosive products from both central conduit (1989-2001) and lateral dyke (2001 and 2002) eruptions. Pressures are obtained from the dissolved H2O and CO2 concentrations, and vapour-melt partition coefficients of S, Cl and F are derived from best fitting of melt inclusion data for each step of magma evolution. This allows us to compute the compositional evolution of the gas phase during either open or closed system degassing and to compare it with the measured composition of emitted gases. We find that sulphur, chlorine and fluorine begin to exsolve at respective pressures of ∼140 MPa, ∼100 MPa and ≤ 10 MPa during Etna basalt ascent and are respectively degassed at {\textgreater} 95{\%}, 22-55{\%}, and ∼15{\%} upon eruption. Pure open system degassing fails to explain gas compositions measured during either lateral dyke or central conduit eruptions. Instead, closed-system ascent and eruption of the volatile-rich basaltic melt well accounts for the time-averaged gas composition measured during 2002-type lateral dyke eruptions (S/Cl molar ratio of 5 ± 1, 35{\%} bulk Cl loss). Extensive magma fragmentation during the most energetic fountaining phases enhances Cl release (55{\%}) and produces a lower S/Cl ratio of 3.7, as actually measured. Comparatively slower magma rise in the central conduits of Etna favours both sulphide saturation of the melt and greater chlorine release (55{\%}), resulting in a distinct S/Cl evolution path and final ratio in eruptive gas. In both eruption types, any previous bubble-melt separation at depth leads to increased S/Cl and S/F ratios in emitted gas. High S/Cl ratios measured during some discrete eruptive events can thus be explained by transitions from closed (deep) to open (shallow) system degassing, with differential gas transfer extending down to ∼2 km depth below the vents. This depth coincides with the base of the volcanic pile where structural discontinuities and the high magma vesicularity (60{\%}) may favour separate gas flow. Finally, the excess S-Cl-F gas discharge through Etna summit craters during non-eruptive periods requires a mixed supply from shallow magma degassing in the volcanic conduits and deeper-derived SO2-rich bubbles from the sub-volcano plumbing system. Our modelling provides a useful reference framework for interpreting the monitored variations of S, Cl and F in Mount Etna gas emissions as a function of volcanic activity. More broadly, the observations made for S, Cl and F degassing on Etna may apply to other basaltic volcanoes with water-rich magmas, such as in arcs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fluorite is the most common fluoride mineral in magmatic silicic systems and its crystallization can moderate or buffer fluorine concentrations in these settings. We have experimentally determined fluorite solubility and speciation mechanisms in haplogranitic melts at 800–950 °C, 100 MPa and aqueous-fluid saturation. The starting haplogranite compositions: peraluminous (alumina saturation index, ASI = 1.2), subaluminous (ASI = 1.0) and peralkaline (ASI = 0.8) were variably doped with CaO or F2O−1 in the form of stoichiometric mineral or glass mixtures. The solubility of fluorite along the fluorite–hydrous haplogranite binaries is low: 1.054 ± 0.085 wt.{\%} CaF2 (peralkaline), 0.822 ± 0.076 wt.{\%} (subaluminous) and 1.92 ± 0.15 wt.{\%} (peraluminous) at 800 °C, 100 MPa and 10 wt.{\%} H2O, and exhibits a minimum at ASI ∼ 1. Fluorite saturation isotherms are strongly hyperbolic in the CaO–F2O−1 space, suggesting that fluorite saturation is controlled by the activity product of CaO and F2O−1, i.e., these components are partially decoupled in the melt structure. The form of fluorite liquidus isotherms implies distinct roles of fluorite crystallization: in Ca-dominant systems, fluorite crystallization is controlled by the fluorine concentration in the melt only and remains nearly independent of calcium contents; in F-rich systems, the crystallization of fluorite is determined by CaO contents and it does not buffer fluorine concentration in the melt. The apparent equilibrium constant, K, for the equilibrium CaO + cF2O−1 = CaF2 (+ associates) is log K= − (2.449 ± 0.085){\textperiodcentered}Al2O3exc + (4.902 ± 0.066); the reaction-stoichiometry parameter varies as follows: c= − (0.92 ± 0.11){\textperiodcentered}Al2O3exc + (1.042 ± 0.084) at 800 °C, 100 MPa and fluid saturation where Al2O3exc are molar percent alumina in excess over alkali oxides. The reaction stoichiometry, c, changes at subaluminous composition: in peralkaline melts, competition of other network modifiers for excess fluorine anions leads to the preferential alkali–F short-range order, whereas in peraluminous compositions, excess alumina associates with calcium cations to form calcioaluminate tetrahedra. The temperature dependence of fluorite solubility is described by the binary symmetric Margules parameter, W = 36.0 ± 1.4 kJ (peralkaline), 39.7 ± 0.5 kJ (subaluminous) and 32.8 ± 0.7 kJ (peraluminous). The strong positive deviations from ideal mixing imply the occurrence of CaF2–granite liquid–liquid immiscibility at temperatures above 1258 °C, which is consistent with previous experimental data. These experimental results suggest very low solubilities of fluorite in Ca-rich melts, consistent with the lack of fluorine enrichment in peralkaline rhyolites and calc-alkaline batholiths. On the other hand, high CaO concentrations necessary to crystallize fluorite in F-rich peraluminous melts are not observed in nature and thus magmatic crystallization of fluorite in topaz-bearing silicic suites is suppressed. A procedure for calculating fluorite solubility and the liquidus isotherms for a whole-rock composition and temperature of interest is provided.},

abstract = {The Whakamaru eruption is the largest-volume eruption known to have originated from the hyper-productive Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Major, minor and trace element concentrations of plagioclase crystals and cathodoluminescence images, used as a proxy for Ti concentrations in quartz crystals, have been used to explore their chemical zonation. Three plagioclase populations are identified. Group 1 crystals are characterized by inherited cores of composition An45–60, Ba 115–650 ppm and La 3–9 ppm, rims of c. An30, Ba 450–800 ppm and La 7–10 ppm and the presence of a thin overgrowth rim on several crystals cores. Group 2 crystals are oscillatory-zoned plagioclases of composition An30–40, Ba 450–730 ppm and La 8{\textperiodcentered}5–9{\textperiodcentered}5 ppm. Group 3 plagioclase crystals have cores of An25–35 and rims of An20–25 and low Sr contents (280–480 ppm). From the chemical composition of these plagioclase crystals, four physicochemically distinct rhyolitic melts are identified: (1) an andesitic progenitor melt in which the cores of Group 1 crystals crystallized; (2) a greywacke melt or greywacke protolith melt responsible for narrow overgrowth rims on Group 1 crystal cores; (3) melt derived from the rejuvenation of a mature crystal mush body from which Group 3 plagioclase crystals crystallized; (4) a final, rhyolitic melt created by the amalgamation of varying proportions of the andesitic, greywacke-derived and rejuvenated melts with subsequent, open-system fractional crystallization of a plagioclase-dominant crystal assemblage. Cathodoluminescence imaging of quartz crystals reveals complex zonation, the result of a dynamic crystallization history from potentially polygenetic sources. Diffusion modelling of the greyscale intensity of cathodoluminescence images (as a proxy for Ti content) for a selection of bright core–rim interfaces of quartz crystals suggests that renewed quartz growth at the rim zones occurred {\textless}300 years (peak likelihood 50–70 years) prior to and continued towards the climactic eruption. This is consistent with timescales of {\textless}280 years determined from core–rim interfaces of Group 1 plagioclase crystals, suggesting that the magma chamber was ephemeral, derived from mixing of magmas from multiple sources shortly prior to eruption. This study adds to a growing body of evidence for the ephemeral nature and geologically rapid mixing and mobilization of liquid silicic magma bodies leading to supereruptions, compared with the timescales of hundreds of thousands of years required to accumulate the precursor magma and crystals.},

abstract = {We have investigated trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and silicic melts ranging from 62 to 69 wt{\%} SiO2 in piston-cylinder experiments at 1.1 GPa and 1145-1155 degrees C. Run products consist of diopsidic clinopyroxene (with 3-5 wt{\%} Al2O3 and similar to 1 wt{\%} Na2O) coexisting with silicic, aluminous, and alkaline melts. Clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients for rare earth elemendts (REE) are significantly higher (e.g., D-Sm = 0.76 to 3.1) than previous studies of clinopyroxene-basaltic melt partitioning. The maximum D-REE is also shifted toward middle REE (e.g., Tb). Although the partition coefficients of Sr and Ti (D-Sr = 0.23-0.39, D-Ti = 0.28-1.0) are also elevated relative to clinopyroxene-basaltic melt, partition coefficients for Zr and Li (0.14-0.23 and 0.16-0.25, respectively) are within the range of literature values. The high partition coefficients for REE, Sr, and Ti in this study do not reflect crystal-compositional effects. For instance, no relationship is observed between Al-1V and these partition coefficients. REE and Ti partition coefficients correlate poorly with jadeite component of the clinopyroxene; however, the elevated Na2O contents of both the melt and clinopyroxene make it difficult to discriminate fully the effect of jadeite component from the effect of changes in melt structure. The non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation ratio (NBO/T; Mysen et al. 1985) varies from 0.08 to 0.17 and roughly correlates with D-epx/melt(REE), consistent with a recent study (Gaetani 2004) that concluded that melt structure significantly affects partitioning when NBO/T {\textless} 0.49. Notably, we find a strong correlation between the molar Ca2+/(M+ + M2+) of the melt and the optimum D (D-0) for the REE, indicating that melt structure, and not jadeite content, is the dominant control on clinopyroxene-melt partitioning in these experiments. The partition coefficients for the REE, Ti, Zr, and Sr are in good agreement with observed clinopyroxene-silicic glass partitioning within mantle xenoliths (Chazot et al. 1996; Vannucci et al. 1998), indicating these results may apply to lithospheric melting. Furthermore, the origin of hump-shaped REE patterns observed in residual clinopyroxene from abyssal peridotites could be explained if shallow depleted melts of peridotite are silica-rich. A two-stage fractional melting model assuming clinopyroxene-silicic melt partitioning at shallow mantle depths from 10 to 30 km beneath a mid-ocean ridge can reproduce the observed hump-shaped REE patterns. If so, hump-shaped REE patterns may provide evidence for the existence and extraction of silica-rich melt created in the shallow mantle.},

abstract = {Eudialytes are a group of complex Na-Ca zirconosilicate minerals that generally occur in peralkaline agpaitic syenites. Given that eudialytes are easily altered and commonly contain inclusions of earlier-crystallized minerals, in situ laser ablation is considered as the most suitable method to determine their U-Pb ages, and Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic compositions. Electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS analysis of eudialytes from nepheline syenites from Il{\'{i}}maussaq (Greenland), Khibiny and Lovozero (Russia), Saima (China), Tamazeght (Morocco), Kipawa and Mont Saint Hilaire (Canada), Po{\c{c}}os de Caldas (Brazil) and Langesund Fjord (Norway), indicate that this mineral typically has high contents of U, Pb, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and rare earth elements (REE).Analysis of an in-house standard eudialyte by both solution and laser ablation methods demonstrates that precise and accurate U-Pb ages can be obtained from eudialyte after correction for the common Pb content. The high Sr, Nd and Hf contents in eudialyte, coupled with the generally low Rb/Sr and Lu/Hf ratios, also permit the precise determination of in situ Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic ratios by LA-(MC)-ICP-MS methods. However, some eudialytes with Rb/Sr ratio of {\textgreater}0.02 and Yb/Sr{\textgreater}0.1, and Lu/Hf{\textgreater}0.08 (or Yb/Hf {\textgreater}0.4-0.5) cannot be used for in situ Sr and Hf isotopic measurement.

abstract = {Nuclear winter is the term for a theory describing the climatic effects of nuclear war. Smoke from the fires started by nuclear weapons, especially the black, sooty smoke from cities and industrial facilities, would be heated by the Sun, lofted into the upper stratosphere, and spread globally, lasting for years. The resulting cool, dark, dry conditions at Earth's surface would prevent crop growth for at least one growing season, resulting in mass starvation over most of the world. In addition, there would be massive ozone depletion, allowing enhanced ultraviolet radiation. More people could die in the noncombatant countries than in those where the bombs were dropped, because of these indirect effects. Nuclear proliferation is now expanding the threat. A nuclear war between India and Pakistan could produce so much smoke that it would produce global environmental change unprecedented in recorded human history. Although the number of nuclear weapons in the world has fallen from 70,000 at its peak in the 1980s to less than 10,000 currently deployed, a nuclear war between the United States and Russia could still produce nuclear winter. This theory cannot be tested in the real world. However, analogs can inform us about parts of the theory, and there are many that give support to the theory. They include the seasonal cycle, the diurnal cycle, forest, fires, volcanic eruptions, and dust storms on Mars. The only way to be sure to prevent the climatic effects of nuclear war is to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

Among the many different igneous rocks containing appreciable concentrations of REEs, carbonatites and peralkaline silicate rocks are the most important sources of these elements, both historically and for meeting the anticipated growth in REE demand.

abstract = {Partition coefficients (zircon/meltDM) for rare earth elements (REE) (La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Dy, Er and Yb) and other trace elements (Ba, Rb, B, Sr, Ti, Y and Nb) between zircon and melt have been calculated from secondary ion mass spectrometric (SIMS) analyses of zircon/melt inclusion pairs. The melt inclusion-mineral (MIM) technique shows that DREE increase in compatibility with increasing atomic number, similar to results of previous studies. However, DREE determined using the MIM technique are, in general, lower than previously reported values. Calculated DREE indicate that light REE with atomic numbers less than Sm are incompatible in zircon and become more incompatible with decreasing atomic number. This behavior is in contrast to most previously published results which indicate D {\textgreater} 1 and define a flat partitioning pattern for elements from La through Sm. The partition coefficients for the heavy REE determined using the MIM technique are lower than previously published results by factors of ≈15 to 20 but follow a similar trend. These differences are thought to reflect the effects of mineral and/or glass contaminants in samples from earlier studies which employed bulk analysis techniques.

DREE determined using the MIM technique agree well with values predicted using the equations of Brice (1975), which are based on the size and elasticity of crystallographic sites. The presence of Ce4+ in the melt results in elevated DCe compared to neighboring REE due to the similar valence and size of Ce4+ and Zr4+. Predicted zircon/meltD values for Ce4+ and Ce3+ indicate that the Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios of the melt ranged from about 10−3 to 10−2. Partition coefficients for other trace elements determined in this study increase in compatibility in the order Ba {\textless} Rb {\textless} B {\textless} Sr {\textless} Ti {\textless} Y {\textless} Nb, with Ba, Rb, B and Sr showing incompatible behavior (DM {\textless} 1.0), and Ti, Y and Nb showing compatible behavior (DM {\textgreater} 1.0).

The effect of partition coefficients on melt evolution during petrogenetic modeling was examined using partition coefficients determined in this study and compared to trends obtained using published partition coefficients. The lower DREE determined in this study result in smaller REE bulk distribution coefficients, for a given mineral assemblage, compared to those calculated using previously reported values. As an example, fractional crystallization of an assemblage composed of 35{\%} hornblende, 64.5{\%} plagioclase and 0.5{\%} zircon produces a melt that becomes increasingly more enriched in Yb using the DYb from this study. Using DYb from Fujimaki (1986) results in a melt that becomes progressively depleted in Yb during crystallization.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous M{\'{e}}gantic intrusive complex of southern Qu{\'{e}}bec contains early noritic gabbrodiorites which represent cumulates from crustally contaminated hawaiite to syenite magmas. Whole rock and mineral chemistry, as well as textural evidence, indicate that post-cumulus recrystallization and reaction were important, and most of the amphibole and biotite are thought to have formed in this way. A younger plutonic quartz-syenite ringdyke may not be cogenetic with the gabbro-diorites sice it lacks orthopyroxene. It may, however, be cogenetic with basaltic to riebeckite granite dykes. Fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, aluminous clinopyroxene, and minor Ti-magnetite from critically undersaturated alkali basaltic magmas generated hawaiitic magmas. The development of quartzbearing mugearitic and syenitic residua from the hawaiites can best be modelled by fractionation of amphibole, plagioclase, olivine, oxides, and apatite. Attempts to model fractionation using observed phenocrysts (including clinopyroxene) were unsuccessful. Amphibole fractionation is interpreted to have taken place through a reaction with still-porous, higher-temperature cumulates on the walls of the magma chamber. The plutonic syenites probably represent alkali feldspar cumulates from the residual syenitic melts. Magnesian calc-alkaline lamprophyres exhibit olivine to phlogopite reaction textures, are enriched in Cr, Ni, K, Rb, Nb, Y, Zr, and Si relative to the basaltic dykes, yet have similar incompatible element ratios. Their relation to the basalts is problematical. The late biotite-granite core to the complex is identical to typical White Mountain granites and may have formed as an anatectic cap on rising, fractionating, mantlederived magmas.},

abstract = {Silicate liquids play a key part at all stages of deep Earth evolution, ranging from core and crust formation billions of years ago to present-day volcanic activity. Quantitative models of these processes require knowledge of the structural changes and compression mechanisms that take place in liquid silicates at the high pressures and temperatures in the Earth/'s interior. However, obtaining such knowledge has long been impeded by the challenging nature of the experiments. In recent years, structural and density information for silica glass was obtained at record pressures of up to 100 GPa (ref. 1), a major step towards obtaining data on the molten state. Here we report the structure of molten basalt up to 60 GPa by means of in situ X-ray diffraction. The coordination of silicon increases from four under ambient conditions to six at 35 GPa, similar to what has been reported in silica glass. The compressibility of the melt after the completion of the coordination change is lower than at lower pressure, implying that only a high-order equation of state can accurately describe the density evolution of silicate melts over the pressure range of the whole mantle. The transition pressure coincides with a marked change in the pressure-evolution of nickel partitioning between molten iron and molten silicates, indicating that melt compressibility controls siderophile-element partitioning.},

abstract = {In the early Carboniferous, final subduction of the Rhenohercynian Ocean, accretion of a magmatic arc and docking of microcontinents caused fault reactivation, extension and fault-controlled basin formation in the foreland of the Variscan Orogen. Lithospheric stretching resulted in generally mildly alkaline basaltic volcanism that peaked in the Visean. In the internal Variscides, rapid uplift and granitoid plutonism shortly followed collision and was probably due to slab detachment(s) or removal of orogenic root material. A regional-scale, E-W-oriented stress field was superimposed on a collapsing orogen and its foreland from the Westphalian onwards. In the Stephanian-Early Permian, a combination of outward-propagating collapse, mantle or slab detachment and the regional stress field resulted in widespread formation of fault-controlled basins and extensive magmatism dated at 290-305 Ma. In the foreland, large amounts of felsic volcanic rocks erupted in northern Germany, accompanied by mafic-felsic volcanics and intrusions in the Oslo Rift, and dolerite sills and dyke swarms in Britain and Sweden. In the internal Variscides, mafic rocks are rare and felsic-intermediate compositions predominate. Their apparent subduction-related signature may have been inherited from metasomatized mantle sources or caused by extensive assimilation of continental crust. {\c{e}} The Geological Society of London 2004},

abstract = {The Nolans Bore rare earth element (REE) deposit consists of a network of fluorapatite-bearing veins and breccias hosted within Proterozoic granulites of the Reynolds Range, Central Australia. Mineralisation is divided into three zones (north, central, and south-east), with the north and south-east zones consisting of massive REE-bearing fluorapatite veins, with minor brecciation and carbonate infill. The central zone is distinctively different in mineralogy and structure; it features extensive brecciation, a high allanite content, and a large, epidote-rich enveloping alteration zone. The central zone is a reworking of the original solid apatite veins that formed during the Chewings Orogeny at ca. 1525 Ma. These original apatite veins are thought to derive from phosphate-rich magmatic–hydrothermal fluid exsolved from as-yet unrecognised alkaline magmatic bodies at depth. We define four ore breccia types (BX1–4) in the central zone on the basis of detailed petrological and geochemical analysis of drillcore and thin sections. BX1 ore comprises fluorapatite with minor crackle brecciation with carbonate infill and resembles ore of the north and south-east zones. Breccia types BX2, BX3, and BX4 represent progressive stages of ore brecciation and development of calc-silicate mineral (amphibole, epidote, allanite, calcite) infill. Comparison of bulk ore sample geochemistry between breccia types indicates that REEs were not mobilised more than a few centimetres during hydrothermal alteration and brecciation. Instead, most of the REEs were partitioned from the original REE fluorapatite into newly formed allanite, REE-poor fluorapatite and minor REE carbonate in the breccias. Negative europium (Eu) anomalies in the breccia minerals are accounted for by a large positive Eu anomaly in epidote from the alteration zones surrounding the ore breccias. This observation provides a direct link between ore recrystallisation and brecciation, and the formation of the alteration halo in the surrounding host rocks. Where allanite and fluorapatite are texturally related, the fluorapatite is relatively depleted in the light rare earth elements (LREEs), whereas allanite is relatively LREE enriched, suggesting co-crystallisation. We tentatively date the BX1 ore stage to 1440 ± 80 Ma based on U–Pb dating of thorianite. Sm–Nd isotope isochrons derived from in situ isotope analysis of cognate apatite and allanite date the BX2 and BX3 events to ca. 400 Ma, while U–Pb dating of late-stage monazite from the BX4 ore stage returned an age of ca. 350 Ma. Therefore, formation of the central zone at Nolans Bore involved multiple alteration/brecciation events that collectively span over 1 billion years in duration. We suggest that the BX1-type veins and breccias were formed from REE-rich, saline (F- and Cl-bearing) fluids that infiltrated the granulite-grade host rocks in association with either shear activation events of the Redbank Shear Zone (1500–1400 Ma) or intrusion of late-stage pegmatites of the Mt Boothby area. BX2, BX3, and BX4 events record deformation and hydrothermal alteration associated with the Alice Springs Orogeny (400–350 Ma). These hydrothermal events occurred at temperatures of 450 to {\~{}}600 °C, due to inflow of highly acidic hydrous fluids derived from a magmatic source, or from mixing of meteoric and metamorphic fluids. Our data testify to the long and complex geological history of not only the Nolans Bore REE deposit, but also of the rocks of the eastern Reynolds Range, and demonstrate the great utility of using hydrothermally derived REE minerals to trace the timing of crustal deformation events and source of associated hydrothermal fluids.},

They consist of a core rich in analcime and arfvedsonite and a rim rich in analcime, aegirine and a low temperature potassium feldspar. The host lujavrite is dominated by albite and arfvedsonite. The igneous lamination of the host continues undisturbed through rim and core of spheroids and the arfvedsonite crystals in host, rim and core have identical chemical compositions. There are sharp contacts between host and rim and rim and core. Host, rim and core contain the same accessory minerals and have almost identical chemical compositions, the main differences are high H2O and Na2O but low SiO2 in the core and high Fe2O3 in the rim. The spheroids are proposed to have been formed by separation of immiscible interstitial H2O-rich globules of magma from the host lujavrite magma at a late stage in the crystallization of the lujavritic melt.},

abstract = {Magma chamber dynamics at the phonolitic to basanitic Teide-Pico Viejo volcanic complex on Tenerife, Canary Islands, have been investigated using feldspar zonation and chemistry. Backscattered electron-image grey value profiles, obtained by electron microprobe and calibrated on anorthite content, allow the investigation of much better spatially resolved zonation profiles than quantitative point analysis alone. On the basis of these zonation patterns and trace element analyses by electron microprobe, magma chamber processes such as magma recharge and mingling, as well as whole-chamber overturn events, can be identified and characterized in more detail. Samples from all investigated eruption centres contain feldspars, which have experienced growth in a deep reservoir, followed by ascent, resorption, and growth of mantles in more shallow levels in the crust just prior to eruption. Two Pico Viejo samples exhibit feldspars with a characteristic drop in anorthite content, which is not accompanied by resorption. Trace element behaviour in these samples shows that cores and mantles have grown from the same magma reservoir: The conclusion from these data is that there occurred complete overturn events in layered magma chambers, presumably induced by cold plumes from the cupola layers. A mass balance calculation shows that the proportions of the layers are ∼ 75 wt.{\%} lower part and ∼ 25 wt.{\%} cupola layer. Correlations between zonation patterns of single crystals in different rocks show that the Teide magma chambers are larger and chemically buffered compared with the smaller Pico Viejo system. Feldspars from Pico Viejo exhibit rather complex anorthite-profiles and more frequently display disturbances likely to be caused by arrival of new magma batches. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Tornare2016,
abstract = {Fractional crystallization is a widely accepted mechanism to account for
magmatic differentiation, but the location and geometry of the locations
where this process takes place are still largely unknown. This is mainly
due to the scarcity of occurrences where direct links between
deep-seated cumulate rocks and their associated differentiation products
are observed. The island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Archipelago
offers such an opportunity. A dismembered Miocene volcano reveals a
complex plutonic root zone, named PX1, consisting of a network of feeder
conduits that can be related to remnants of contemporaneous lava flows.
The lavas reveal a typical alkaline differentiation trend, whereas PX1
is composed of vertically layered cumulate lithologies ranging from
olivine-rich wehrlites to clinopyroxenites and gabbros. Clinopyroxene
phenocrysts in lavas (73.2-86.5Mg{\#}) exhibit the same zoning features
and compositional ranges in major and trace elements as the plutonic
clinopyroxenes, suggesting a direct genetic link between plutonic and
effusive rocks. We interpret the PX1 rocks as resulting from the
accumulation in volcanic conduits of phenocrysts segregated from
ascending crystal-bearing magmas. Semi-quantitative modeling shows that
fractional crystallization can indeed explain the evolution of the
erupted lavas from basalt to basaltic trachyandesite. Progressive
fractionation of the mineral assemblages olivine -{\textgreater} olivine + minor
clinopyroxene -{\textgreater} clinopyroxene -{\textgreater} clinopyroxene + plagioclase -{\textgreater}
plagioclase + kaersutite + apatite, with variable amounts of Fe-Ti
oxides, can reproduce the major element compositional trend revealed by
the Fuerteventura lavas. This calculated sequence coincides with the
sequence of crystallization deduced from the textures of the PX1 rocks
and could a priori generate the mineral assemblages that constitute the
plutonic cumulates. However, complex core-mantle chemical zoning
observed in PX1 clinopyroxenes suggests more complicated differentiation
processes than simple crystal segregation and accumulation in vertical
conduits. Primitive cores in PX1 clinopyroxenes (Mg{\#}80-88) display
resorption features and sieve textures; they are interpreted as
pre-existing crystals entrained from deeper levels or crystallized
during the early stages of magma evolution. Clinopyroxene mantles
display more evolved compositions (Mg{\#}74-80) with reverse zoning and
external resorption features. Asymmetry in chemical zoning suggests
crystallization in a confined environment such as a crystal mush. All
these observations point to progressive mineral coarsening in the
crystal cumulates, induced by the pervasive percolation of uprising
melts on their way to the surface. The main factors controlling the
variability of the cumulate lithologies are the crystal-melt segregation
efficiency, the degree of differentiation and modal proportions of the
magmas at their time of intrusion, and the extraction efficiency of the
residual melts from the cumulates. The proposed model suggests that a
differentiation process could take place in the feeder conduits and does
not require storage of significant magma volumes (or magma chambers) in
the crust to explain the observed evolution from mafic to intermediate
magmas. Nevertheless, the existence of such large magma reservoirs is
not excluded, in particular to explain the generation of significant
volumes of differentiated lavas, as observed in other Canary Islands.
Magma differentiation in vertical conduits opens up new perspectives in
the understanding of fractional crystallization processes associated
with the evolution of alkaline mafic magmas in ocean islands and
continental intraplate settings.},

abstract = {The Southern Feeder Dike Complex is part of the Franklin Large Igneous Province (LIP), exposed in the Minto Inlier of Victoria Island in the Canadian Arctic. Previous field and geochemical studies on the Franklin LIP considered its igneous rocks to be prospective for Fe-Ni-Cu mineralization. The Southern Feeder Dike Complex comprises a series of NW-SE-trending gabbroic intrusions and sedimentary hosts. Field and textural relationships show that the Complex intrusions were emplaced contemporaneously with Neoproterozoic normal faulting. Faulted contact zones correspond to prominent first derivative magnetic lineaments. Gabbroic dikes have intrusive contacts against brecciated country rock, and diabasic microxenoliths in basaltic matrices indicate multiple intrusive/brecciation events. Intrusive breccias are commonly overprinted by hydrothermal greenschist facies assemblages, with calcite + pyrite veins filling open spaces between breccia fragments. Late dikes emplaced into these heterogeneous breccias contain disseminated globular and net-textured sulfides suggesting that sulfide immiscibility was triggered on a local scale by assimilation of local wall rock. This inference is supported by elevated $\delta$34S values of sulfides in these dikes, consistent with assimilation of country rocks. Wall-rock assimilation would have been facilitated by fault-related brecciation and cataclasis, which would expose extensive xenolith surface areas to fresh magma. Gossanous and meter-scale semimassive sulfide showings associated with dikes and sills located upsection from the Southern Feeder Dike Complex suggest that immiscible sulfide liquids may have been flushed downstream (or upsection) during replenishment of composite dike systems. Fault-mediated melt ascent along northwest-southeast faults has been documented elsewhere in the Minto Inlier, providing equivalent opportunities for wall-rock assimilation and consequent triggering of sulfide immiscibility and sulfide melt redistribution. The evidence preserved in the Complex confirms the Fe-Ni-Cu potential of the Franklin LIP and informs current models of ore deposit formation in conduit-type magmatic plumbing systems.},

abstract = {Carbonatites are redefined using a mineralogical-genetic classification and divided into two groups: primary carbonatites, and carbothermal residua. Attention is drawn to the fact that carbonatite is both a petrographic term applicable to a particular rock-type as well as a group name applied to a complex of related carbonate and silicate rocks in a magmatic or extrusive complex. Primary carbonatites, in terms of mineralogical-genetic classifications, rather than simple modal classifications, can be divided into a group of bona fide magmatic carbonatites formed from diverse mantle-derived magmas, i.e., carbonatites associated with the melilitite, nephelinite, aillikite and kimberlite clans, with the latter best being termed calcite kimberlites. Each magma type and associated carbonatites are considered to be genetically distinct, and formed at different depths in the upper mantle by different degrees of partial melting. Carbonatites associated with the melilitite and nephelinite clans can have a multiplicity of origins, and may be formed by fractional melting, fractional crystallization or liquid immiscibility. Calcite kimberlites are small-volume late-forming differentiates that are not related to other carbonatites or their parental magmas. The origin and genetic relationships of the Oldoinyo Lengai natrocarbonatite cannot be unambiguously determined, although these rocks are regarded as a distinct variety of primary carbonatite. Carbonate-rich rocks associated with diverse potassic or sodic peralkaline saturated to undersaturated magmas derived predominantly from metasomatized lithospheric mantle, together with REE-carbonate-rich rocks of undetermined genesis, are best termed carbothermal residua rather than carbonatite. There can be mineralogical (or modal) convergence between these rocks and low-pressure REE-rich derivatives of bona fide primary carbonatites. Carbonate-rich rocks formed by pneumatolytic reactions or anatectic melting of crustal rocks should not be considered to be carbonatites.},
